The Mandalorian,"It seems be a gift for the old fans of ""Star Wars"". a return to the origins, after the last films, too obvious having as target the new generations. In same measure, it is a brilliant example of the use for western recipe. And the couple of silent loner and baby Yoda works in beautiful way. The cinematography is great, the storytelling - well crafted. I admit- for me the basic source of seduction remains the presence of Wener Herzog in a role perfect for Klaus Kinski.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1
The Mandalorian,"If you are watching a Star Wars marathon in chronological order, place this series between episodes VI and VII. The New Republic is weak and the remnant of the empire have become warlords and mercenaries. The Mandalorian is also a legendary mercenary whose family was killed during the Droid War. He hates droids. In episode one he is to retrieve a live bounty that turns out to be a 50 year old baby Yoda. It would not be the real Yoda, but born while Yoda was still alive and about 900 years old. For the rest of the series he beats up folks who are after the baby Yoda and how this fits into anything is not clear. Typical Star Wars characters and it looks like before this is over, everyone in Hollywood will be a $100 autograph at a Star Wars convention. They also bring back HellBoy.",1,1,1,1,1,1,0
The Mandalorian,"Right, well yeah, I grew up on ""Star Wars"" and have been loving it ever since ""Star Wars Episode 4: A New Hope"", and I am still loving it today. So when ""The Mandalorian"" was announced, I was thrilled.And now having sat through the entire first season, I must say that I am impressed and I am entertained, and I am enjoying this tremendously. Creator Jon Favreau is definitely on to something here with this series; something that is as close to the original trilogy as it can be. And man, this is phenomenal.The storyline is interesting and has a good variety to it, so there is something for everybody, ranging from classic ""Star Wars"" action in terms of duels, gunfights, space combat, and such - you know what I mean here.And ""The Mandalorian"" offers a nice insight into the term of being a Mandalorian, as they have been fairly poorly portrayed for the average public and casual viewers, anyone not well-traversed in the universe of ""Star Wars"". I mean, this show made one of my friends come up and say to me, 'I thought Mandalorians were evil, but it is a way of living, a mentality, a creed'.The special effects in this TV series is good, but as if there ever were any doubts with Lucasfilm and Disney being behind the project. And it has that classic ""Star Wars"" feel to it, but with an added multiple layers. They managed to make it a tad more gritty and also have that classic Western feel to it. And it works marvelously in favor of the series.As for the main character, the Mandalorian, aka Dyn Jarren, well he is interesting, and there are some really nice qualities and touches to the character, and I must say that Pedro Pascal portrays the helmet main character quite well. While he is the main character, there is no doubt about the fact that the child - as the public dubbed 'baby Yoda' - has stolen the show. And what is not to like? He is so awesome, cute and he wields The Force. I liked the child from the very first time we saw him on the screen, and with each episode my liking has just grown and grown.""The Mandalorian"" plays on all the right buttons for a fan of the ""Star Wars"" universe, especially when they brought stormtroopers, scout troopers, death troopers and the TIE fighter into the series. That just felt right; it felt like coming home.Now, the series is not carried by Pedro Pascal alone, there are some nice acting performances by the likes of Carl Weathers, Werner Herzog, Gina Carano and Nick Nolte, to mention the most prominent of performers. They have a great cast, and people perform quite well, bringing the characters to life in this rich and vibrant universe.The props and costumes are spot on, and there are so many amazing details in every episode. This helped bring the ""Star Wars"" universe out on the screen in such a great way.I have seen every episode three or four times; the first time around for the storyline, then going back to watch it for the details. Plus, I must admit that the show is entertaining enough to support multiple viewings.This is certain winner for the ""Star Wars"" universe, and it was a much needed addition to the franchise. I am rating it a solid ten out of ten stars.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1
The Mandalorian,"I'm amazed at how going off track from the main Star Wars storyline has produced, arguably, better movies and shows. Sure, Baby Yoda aka Grogu, is adorable enough to make any warm-blooded person fall in love.""The Mandalorian"" is indispensable watching for anyone who even has a passing interest in ""Star Wars"" and the season two finale was the coup de grace.",1,1,1,1,1,1,-999
The Mandalorian,"After so many years of postponing I finally decided to watch all the Star Wars movies and so also this series. Since there are different ways to watch it I'm going for the chronological order and not the release date order, that just makes more sense to me. Maybe I watched a couple movies when I was young, I probably did, but I don't remember anything about it so to me it's all new and maybe one day I will understand the whole hype about the Star Wars saga. After watching The Phantom Menace, Attack Of The Clones, Revenge Of The Sith, Solo: A Star Wars Story, Rogue One, A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back and Return Of The Jedi it's now time for The Mandalorian. It's supposed to be happening between Return Of The Jedi and The Force Awakens so it's only logical I watch it now. I do hope there will be much more seasons though as I just loved this show. Pedro Pascal is perfect as The Mandalorian. Each episode is quite short but very enjoyable to watch, certainly if you just watched all the other movies just before. It's a nice continuation of this saga. You can write whatever you want about the early movies in this saga, but the modern ones just beat them in everything, quality, acting, and technology, as so does this series. I binge watched the first season in 24 hours that's how good I thought it was. Next will be The Force Awakens but to be honest I can't wait to watch other seasons from The Mandalorian as it's for me the best thing in the whole Star Wars saga thus far.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1
The Mandalorian,"The Mandalorian Questions: Why does an expert bounty hunter who lives in his helmet need a monocular? Wouldn't his helmet be able to Robocop Zoom Vision? Also, why do droids need currency? And finally, why couldn't they make Episode VIII and Solo this good? This was only 39 minutes and was 10x more enjoyable than the last two Star Wars movies combined.Anyways, Episode I of THE MANDALORIAN (3½/5 Stars.) I have spoken.",1,1,1,1,1,1,0
The Mandalorian,"""The Mandalorian"" is one series that entertains with action and adventure and you can just feel the ""Star Wars"" atmosphere as the scenes and backdrops show the universe and many characters are noticeable set after the fall of the empire and before the rise of a new order in the republic the series follows the travels and life of one lone bounty hunter. The action and adventure keeps you glued and the discovery of one little cute pointy long eared green baby is a nice wild card and supporting theme for the series. Really good work from the ""Star Wars"" universe a must watch for the saga's fan base.",1,1,1,1,1,1,0
The Mandalorian,"There are a lot of impressive things about The Mandalorian, but what I love the most is the way it introduces fully three-dimensional characters with detailed backstories that are only hinted at in every episode, even though some are one-ofs and others only show up intermittently.That guy in the first episode who kept saying ""I have spoken,"" the love interest on that peaceful planet, that over-the-top knife thrower who knew Mando back in the day. You could spin any of them into a season's worth of episodes, but instead they're here and gone in a flash.That's how much work goes into each episode. This is detailed world, and yes, this world has been being built for decades which gives the series an advantage, but then, humans have been around for centuries and there are still lots of series with sketched-out characters.Also, first rate special effects, lots of exciting action, cool robots, mysterious hero with a personal code of honor that has a lot of gray areas, super cute critter with strange powers ... it's just all so good.If you like Star Wars, you definitely need to watch this. If you don't, watch it anyway, just to admire it's commitment to fleshing out its guest characters.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1
The Mandalorian,"Some good cinematography, other than that nothing about this show impressed me. and it did a horrendous job of getting me hooked or invested in the story. i was bored for most of the episode, and then the action scenes were just fine. i watched 4 episodes. i quit (1 viewing 1/2020)",1,1,1,1,1,1,1
The Mandalorian,"Definitely lives up to the hype and is exactly what a Star Wars series should be! Filmed incredibly well, exhilarating to watch everything play out, deserving of awards, and the characters are magnificent! I almost could've watched sooner but glad I finally got around to it now.",1,1,1,1,1,1,0
The Mandalorian,Season 2 (5 out of 5 stars.)The second season picks up with a lot of action. Emotional story. Fun new characters. And surprises. Story continues where the last ended. Trying to find the other Mandalorians. There are some fun new surprises with characters making an appearance. Also leaving room for more spin offs. Each episode is action packed. And bigger. The cast ensemble is great. The music score is an improvement and little different. Baby yoda is fun. And is heartwarming. Also has an emotional ending. And a wild battle in the seasons climax. While leaving room for more to come.,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
The Mandalorian,"This sci-fi series takes place after the events of ""Return of the Jedi"" and precedes ""The Force Awakens"" where we meet a bounty hunter called,
a Mandalorian (Pedro Pascal) who gets into action and adventure while protecting a baby creature resembling Jedi master, Yoda that's targeted by other bounty hunters and imperial members. Mando also meets allies along the way which include droids. This is a great side story to the ""Star Wars"" universe, Pascal is great in the title role resembling bounty hunter, Boba Fett, there's neat effects and a good score. Nick Nolte, Carl Weathers and Gina Carano also appear. If you're a fan of ""Star Wars"" or sci-fi in general, check this out.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1
The Mandalorian,"For a TV series, the props, sets and S/VFX are amazing, and 4 episodes in, the stories are well written and directed, but I find the dialogue and some action scenes a little too cheesy in some episodes - too Disney-ish meant for a much younger audience. I hope that improves over time for the original old-school audiences. Nevertheless, love the prequel concept and little Yoda is so cute, I want one! 8/10 from me.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1
The Mandalorian,"Well, so far I have only seen the pilot... and I'm still kind of convinced that they will ruin it but, for the moment, it is fantastic with the only real draw back being the score and some of the sets.Well cover the bad first. The score is horrible. In no way does it sound like a Star Wars movie. But that can be fixed.And the second is the sets, three different bars, three different worlds, the exact same place. I understand it's a cost cutting thing, but change it up a bit.Now the good.They dropped the agenda. It's still there, a little, but the agenda doesn't dominate the plot. It's not made to drive a wedge between the fans, and the political shriekers. It's not made to let people point their fingers and shriek ""Misogynist, WWII bad guy word, Boomer, Russianbot,"" at anyone that doesn't like it. It's not weighted to do anything BUT tell a story.And the result is that it actually tells a fun story.Now the story is simplistic, but it's a pilot, and no one ever said that they wanted a complex, convoluted, Oliver Stone plot, they just said they wanted an actual story.So the plot can be simplistic as all get out and still entertain. And it does.The other positive is that it FINALLY feels like an actual Star Wars story again. They aren't attempting to ""divert expectations"" by making a Star Wars flick that is not a Star Wars flick... they actually made a Star Wars flick.It feels like Star Wars again. And that is fun, it has all of the appeal of a Star Wars flick, and it has very little of the baggage that came with the Kennedy films.Ultimately, it's a fun series, it's a Star Wars show, it actually feels like it's about Star Wars and not about dividing the fan base.",1,0,1,1,-1,0,-1
The Mandalorian,"THAT was cool!I just got done with the 2nd episode, and things are rapidly falling into place.This is like watching sections of any given Star Wars movie (the best parts) every week. I wasn't expecting this kind of production value. On this scale.My only complaint? The episodes are too short! Should be longer.Regardless of that, I look forward to more episodes of this.",1,0,1,1,0,0,1
The Mandalorian,"A very pleasant story. Probably one of the best in the Star Wars universe. And it's impressive how they could integrate so many elements from A New Hope without making a rehash. And even the characters are quite good. Not as good as some of the better series of NetFlix, but very good compared with what mainstream TV still produces.Sadly, they never polished the product and the special effects team is the best by far. The direction is okay, but with many cheap drama. For example in the 4th episode, probably the worst of the first four, the Mandalorian knows he's in a peaceful village, there is nothing threatening, yet he jumps when a kid sneaks in. Is he a bounty hunter or a domestic abuse victim?The script is even worse than the direction once you stop going with the flow. I mean the guy has levitation devices, yet he can't have some perimeter sensor to know that many individuals are about to jump him? Smart droids and no smart phone app to tell you that somebody is robbing your ship and you might be stuck in the middle of nowhere?And what's with all the deus ex machina? The hero is cornered, but here's the entire Eastern Front Army to the rescue! He might be eaten alive by a herbivore, but a farmer just happens to be near and saves him?And the choreography is cute as long as you keep it shallow. But the guy has a fancy new armor that can take a cannon shot, yet he will get beaten like dressed in a flannel shirt. And the armor is magical, probably as negative weight, as thugs will keep throwing him as he's in his bathing suit.Enter the populist junk: the village that lives in perfect harmony with themselves and with the nature. The clothes are industrially made, clean, too clean for some people working all day in the field. The population of the isolated village is Asian, after all Disney strives for diversity, but the actors are from all over Asia, not just one area, a bit too much genetic diversity. And the villagers are happy, although they are under constant threat from the robbers. And the robbers don't seem to do much over the year, but rob this village.So, yea, a nice story, but don't think about it or it will prove just another Hollywood piece.",1,0,0,1,-999,1,0
The Mandalorian,"A bounty hunter makes his way through the outer reaches of the galaxy, far from the authority of the New Republic.Directed by Dave Filoni The Mandalorian chapter one is excellent, it may not be a feature length film but this live action series is thankfully the next best thing. Created by Jon Favreau and with Disney and Lucas Film wallet he offers great production values, practical effects, hidden FX and a music score to match, it does not disappoint.Actor Pedro Pascal expertly echoes Boba Fett injecting his own nuances and movements into this new lead character. The tone is perfect and feels like Star Wars should.It is not just all new Uber characters and elements. It welcoming builds and expands George Lucas' established universe. For example recycling/reusing established species and droids (including the Ewok's Battle for Endor's Blurrgs) to name but a few. Filoni also offers an IG bounty droid mirroring the IG-88 ESB character. You get to see a bounty droid in action.With a job from Carl Weathers' Greef Carga, Pascal's Mandalorian tracks a target for a well-paying client (Werner Herzog) he freezes and shoots his way through the episode with The Man with No Name prowess. With the help of an indigenous character Kuill (voiced by Nick Nolte) and the bounty droid IG-11 our hero proves his honour durning a surprise reveal of a familiar unknown Star Wars species at the closing of the first episode.Overall, aside from a small handful of iffy CGI it's pretty much a TV Star Wars action adventure dream come true.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1

The Mandalorian,"It is disgusting how Disney & Co. flood Imdb with fake rates and fake reviews. The Mandalorian is okayish but nothing good. Maybe the kids will like it but the storyline is boring and predictable (reminds me of those childbooks with big pictures and here and there a few lines of words to describe what happens etc.) and got no more depth as all those animation movies for kids of the Star Wars franchise. Last but not least the characters are shallow like an empty glass, well, maybe the Mandalorian got one or two drops of water left. And I suspect they hired some guys and gals from DC or Marvel, cuz our Mandalorian fights like a superhero - even with the baby in his arms... All in all okay if you got nothing else to do and don't expect too much and you like to listen to the sound of blasters making bumbum.",0,0,-1,0,0,-1,0
The Mandalorian,"When it comes to any film or TV show of 2020 The Mandalorian was the thing that I was looking forward to the most, with it coming to the US last year it built even more and I have now finished the first season of maybe the biggest show in the world and here is my review. The premise of the show sees a Mandalorian bounty hunter track down a package he must protect.
Main Character
Pedro Pascal plays The Mandalorian on this show and this is one of the most interesting characters in recent memory. I have always had a fondness for the tribe of The Mandalorians and this character is fascinating, you see how his moral code and his actual feelings clash with each other and even though he isn't completely a good person he tries to do the right thing and as you learn more and more you become even more interested by this complex characters.
Supporting Characters
Carl Weathers is the main supporting character as the head of the bounty hunter guild and I thought he was excellent in this role. I haven't seen him in anything for a long time but he oozes charisma and you are interested by his character and you see how his moral code pairs up and sometimes conflicts with The Mandalorians and it really works. Gina Carano plays an ally of The Mandalorian and I thought she was a good partner for him on the show, they are a beliveable team and it is great seeing them team up and take down enemies together. Nick Nolte and Taika Waititi offers there voices to really interesting roles and Werner Herzog plays a great antagonist. The great Giancarlo Esposito plays a small role but he shines in every scene that he is in and I want to see more of this character and learn more about how interesting he really is. Also obviously we all know about the phenomenon of Baby Yoda, I won't say much about it but this little creature is a real highlight of the show.
Story
The story is really interesting, I love seeing a post Return Of The Jedi but way before Force Awakens world and how the outlaws are really running the place. The development of The Bounty Hunters Guild was also really interesting and I loved seeing the structure of this organisation. As mentioned the characters are all given interesting arcs and you learn enough but the show doesn't give everything away leaving the door open for even more quality depth being added in future seasons. The ending of the show is fantastic and sets up a really interesting dynamic for the future.
Script
The script for the show is some of the best writing that has been seen in Star Wars. The drama is really deep and interesting seeing characters dealing in a world that doesn't have too many rules apart from their own. Also the humour is here but unlike other Star Wars films it really works here, it is used in small doses but really works and adds more depth to the characters and the show.
Style
The style of the show is amazing, it literally looks like 8 movies, the action scenes are more brutal and hard hitting then the films. It is brilliantly shot and the western style really works in making this an even more interesting show. However, I get to the only thing that I didn't get on board with, the pacing of the show. The first 3 episodes and last two episodes are amazing, some of the more interesting television I have seen in recent years, however, there are episodes 4,5 & 6. While enjoyable they feel very episodic and a bit disconnected to the main story and I felt myself not thinking about them as much as I did the other brilliant episodes.Overall
Overall, the Star Wars license has led to much conflict in recent years but I think everyone can agree The Mandalorian is a fantastic show and I agree with this opinion. This is a must watch show for not only Star Wars fans but fans of great television, I can't wait to see more from this show and I hope it gets even better in the future.",1,1,1,1,0,1,1
The Mandalorian,"So 2020 has been a terrible year, no doubt about it but at least the 2nd season of The Mandalorian has come to Disney+ and after 8 brilliant weeks the season has come to end and here is my review for it. The premise of the season sees Mando on the hunt for more Mandalorians that can hopefully lead him to more of The Child's people - The Jedi.Main Character
In my Wonder Woman 1984 review I was gushing over Pedro Pascal and that continues here as he is superb as Mando. For a character who's face you don't see he adds so much depth and emotion to the role by just changing the cadence of his voice. You truly buy that the relationship between him and The Child has developed and it is the thing that carries this show and really makes you care about him and this story and real credit has to go to Pascal for that.Supporting Characters
The Child was the standout from the first season and he is great again here, it always amazes me that this puppet can be so adorable and make me care so much but it does it. Like I said above the relationship between those two is what carries this show and is really well done this season and that is a great thing to see. Gina Carano is back as Cara Dune and despite her social media issues I think she is a good addition to the cast. I really like her dynamic with Mando and Carano manages to add some layers to the character and she is great in the action scenes as you would expect. Carl Weathers is back as Greef Karga, though he is a much smaller part of the show he is just such a fun addition to the crew and he also directed a great episode so credit has to go to him for that. Giancarlo Espositio is back as Moff Gideon and given a bit more to do and what would you expect is what you get he is revelling his role as the villain and you learn a bit more about him and Esposito is just great. Now there are plenty of new supporting characters, some on the poster above but I don't want to really talk about them as they are something you should experience yourself all I will say is that they are handled really well and it adds more layers and quality to the show.Story
The story is better this season, the relationship between Mando and The Child is further expanded and developed and I really felt that connection and that it had been a natural development from the first season. One of the things I criticised from the first season was the lack of overall story but I feel like that was sorted this season. Yes it still has a bit of an episodic feel but pretty much every episode has a point to it involving the main story and it definitely develops at a better rate and has way more meat to it leading to one of the best season finales you will ever see.Script
The script is great, I mean when your main character has his face covered it has to be a great script to make you care and this show does that. It does a great job of advancing the drama and also have that nice addition of humour too. Is their fan service this season? yeah but I am a huge fan so I am serviced and it never felt out of place for me and never took away from the show and actually added to it.Style
The action scenes are fantastic, they are all so fast in pace and feel very unique depending on the episode that you are watching. Also what I love about The Mandalorian is the fact that every episode has a different run time, there is very little filler the shorter stories feel the right length and the longer episodes feel the right length. Usually I complain when shows are streamed weekly but The Mandalorian is the exception to rule as I loved the hype each week and I am just a bit sad that the season is over.Overall
Overall, this season is amazing. If you are a Star Wars fan at any level you owe it to yourself to watch this show because you will love it. The show hits all the high levels and is worth every minute of screen time and is a must watch and one of the best of the year for sure.",1,1,1,1,0,1,1
The Mandalorian,"The Mandalorian is everything a Star Wars fan could want with great characters, a cool lead, spectacular action and impressive visuals. There are many quotable lines too; its just a shame we have to wait a year for the next season. This is the way you do Star Wars.",1,1,1,1,0,1,1
The Mandalorian,"I haven't been impressed with Disney Star Wars. While The Force Awakens, Solo, and the first two seasons of Rebels were watchable, everything else has been poorly written, pandering, and uninspired (and of course, TLJ is its own subcategory of terrible). I actually didn't even plan on watching this series-- my family got Disney + on a whim and I figured why not.Turns out THE MANDALORIAN is not half bad. It has a lot of the same vibe as the excellent Clone Wars television series and unlike the sequel trilogy, keeps the nostalgia catnip to a bare minimum. No Jedi, no lightsabers, precious few ""member berries""-- it's very nice.I'm not going to gush just yet. As of this writing, there are only four episodes out and I have been burned too many times by too many TV shows to get too hyped this early, but so far, this actually feels like Star Wars in the classic sense, that fun, pulpy blend of John Ford, Flash Gordon, and Akira Kurosawa. It's a good sign for now.",1,1,1,1,0,1,0
The Mandalorian,"Aside from the cruelty to muppets who get beaten and vaporised (at least Kermit has not been zapped to date) The Mandalorian is actually a reasonable, if not exceptional watch.On the upside, this series has decent episodic stories that build on each other plus excellent full on action.On the downside there's nothing terribly intelligent to be found in this series . Characterisations are a bit flat with a comic book vibe.That said, at least this series knows what it is and plays to its strengths.6/10.",0,0,0,0,-999,-1,1
The Mandalorian,"Star Wars as ""TV episodes"" and not films is just bad news waiting to happen because you'll have filler moments. And then filler episodes. And I can go on and on but I'm sure you'll notice it while watching this series. Is it the most awesome thing on planet earth right now? No. Why are people going so crazy about it? Because the current Star Wars universe is in the toilet and this doesn't s%^k.",0,-999,0,0,-999,-999,-999
Wonder Woman 1984,"It's 1984 in Washington, D.C. Diana Prince (Gal Gadot) fights crime as Wonder Woman. During the day, she works at the Smithsonian Institution where she befriends bumbling newcomer Barbara Minerva (Kristen Wiig). Diana is terribly lonely pining for lost love Steve Trevor (Chris Pine). The FBI needs Minerva to identify a stolen artifact which turns out to be a wishing stone. Diana wishes for Steve while Barbara wishes to be like Diana. Eager TV huckster Maxwell Lord (Pedro Pascal) has been searching for the stone and decides on an unusual wish.The movie feels too long. At two and a half hours, it's not the longest especially for a comic book movie. Nevertheless, it feels very long. While I like most of these premises, some of it could be cut back to speed things up. I don't really like Pascal hamming it up as a TV huckster. I'd rather have him be a simple Scrooge like figure. An evil businessman is a better foil. The actual businessman in the movie can be cut out. I'm also not sure about the logistics of the wishes. They need to be better thought out. A lot of this needs to be better thought out like the final turn. If the son is that final turn, he needs to be more prominent in his life. Overall, this movie just feels a little too long. Maybe it needs more jokes to pass the time. The action could be tightened. She could learn to fly quicker. Things could be done even if the running time remains the same.",0,1,-1,0,-999,0,0
Wonder Woman 1984,"The first film was a fantastic big screen debut for the DC Comics heroine, this was highly anticipated follow-up, the ninth officially in the DC Extended Universe. It has been delayed a number of times since late 2019, then the COVID-19 pandemic did so again, but I'm glad I finally got to see it, directed by Patty Jenkins (Monster). Basically, in her childhood, young Diana (Lilly Aspell) competed in a multistage athletic competition on Themyscira against older Amazons. She is disqualified for taking a shortcut during the competition; her mother, Queen Hippolyta (Connie Nielsen), and her aunt Antiope (Robin Wright) lecture her on the importance of truth. In 1984, decades after the First World War, Diana Prince (Gal Gadot) works as a senior anthropologist at the Smithsonian Institute in Washington, D.C. She also continues to fight crime as Wonder Woman. Diana meets new co-worker, Barbara Ann Minerva (Kristen Wiig), who is insecure, unnoticed by others, and tries to befriend Diana. Whilst researching ancient Mediterranean civilisations and antiquities, Diana is handed a mysterious Dreamstone, which seemingly grants wishes upon contact with any user. Both Diana and Barbara both hold the stone and are unknowingly granted their desires: Diana wishes for her deceased lover, Steve Trevor (Chris Pine), whose soul is transported into another man's body; Barbara wishes to be ""like Diana"", and slowly becomes beautiful, strong, and powerful. Maxwell Lord (Pedro Pascal) is a charismatic businessman and entrepreneur, but he is actually a fraud with a failing business. Lord visits the Smithsonian, it is clear that he knows the power of the stone and wants to get his hands on it. He manages to manipulate Barbara during a gala night at the institute in order to acquire the stone. He makes the wish to become the embodiment of the stone and gains its power. In doing so, he can grant one wish to a person, and take whatever he desires from them. Over the next few days, Maxwell rises to become a powerful influential figure, while leaving chaos and destruction. Diana is overjoyed to have Steve back in her life, and he is amazed by the many innovations of the future. But Diana realises that her wish has come at a price, as she is slowly losing some of her abilities. Barbara however embraces her newfound beauty and popularity and takes advantage of her strength and powers. Diana, Steve, and Barbara investigate the Dreamstone further, it is discovered it was created by the God of Treachery and Mischief. The stone grants a user their wish but takes their most cherished possession in return, and the only way to reverse the condition is by renouncing their wish or destroying the stone itself. Steve realises that his existence comes at the cost of Diana's power. Both Diana and Barbara are unwilling to renounce their wishes and try to figure out another solution. Maxwell is desperate to reach out to as many people as possible to grant their wishes and gain more money and power. He manages to get himself a meeting with the President of the United States (Stuart Milligan), who tells him about a satellite broadcast system that can transmit signals globally. Barbara, desperate to keep her power, is determined to stop Diana from harming Maxwell, and joins him as they travel to broadcast station that he will use to communicate to the entire world, offering to grant their wishes. Steve convinces Diana that she must let him go and renounce her wish, she reluctantly does so and regains her strength, and gains the ability to fly. She returns home and dons the armour of the legendary Amazon warrior Asteria, then heads to the broadcast station. She battles Barbara, who has made another wish with Maxwell, transforming her into apex predator creature Cheetah. After defeating Barbara, Diana confronts Maxwell, who has already communicated to millions of people who make their wishes. But Diana uses her Lasso of Truth to communicate with the world via him, convincing everyone to renounce their wishes, after realising the consequences. Maxwell is convinced to renounce his own wish after realising he will lose his son, Alistair (Lucian Perez). The world is eventually restored, and Maxwell is reunited with his son, telling him the truth about his fraudulent lifestyle. Sometime later, Diana is walking the streets during the Christmas holidays, and she meets the handsome man (Kristoffer Polaha) whose body Steve was inhabiting, and she continues to protect the world. In a mid-credit scene, Asteria (Lynda Carter, who famously played Wonder Woman on television) is revealed to be alive and living among humanity in secret, much like Diana. Also starring Amr Waked as Emir Said Bin Abydos, Natasha Rothwell as co-worker Carol, Ravi Patel as Babajide, Oliver Cotton as Simon Stagg, Gabriella Wilde as Raquel, Kelvin Yu as Jake, and Asim Chaudhry as co-worker Roger. Gadot remains perfect casting as the beautiful warrior princess, Pine is both charming and amusing as he discovers the 80s, Wiig who is normally comedic gives an interesting serious performance, and Pascal is pretty good as the power-hungry villain. I agree that it is little bit long, and the various storylines going on make it a bit messy, but you cannot help but be thrilled by the explosive chase and fight sequences, with fantastic special effects, and one or two good songs, including Frankie Goes to Hollywood, in the soundtrack, an entertaining superhero action.

Wonder Woman 1984,"I did actually enjoy the 2017 movie ""Wonder Woman"" quite a bit, so I was definitely looking forward to this 2020 movie from writers Patty Jenkins, Geoff Johns and Dave Callaham.And while ""Wonder Woman 1984"" was definitely a watchable movie, it just wasn't really up to par with the 2017 movie in anyway. Why? Well, simply because the storyline felt way too comical and the villains in the movie weren't really all that interesting or menacing.The storyline told in ""Wonder Woman 1984"" just fell short of being all that entertaining. Sure, it was a watchable movie, but it was hardly an outstanding or particularly memorable foray into the D.C. world of superheroes. For me, the storyline here felt like something that had been ping ponged around a breakfast table, with the writers just tossing out ideas and settling on something that seemed like something that could be made into a Saturday morning cartoon.Of course it was nice to have Gal Gadot return to portray Diana/Wonder Woman in this 2020 movie, and she was joined with talents such as Chris Pine, Kristen Wiig and Pedro Pascal. I must admit that Pedro Pascal's performance was actually the most brilliant and enjoyable in the movie, and his character was the one with the most appeal in the movie. Mind you, as a villain he just wasn't all there. I mean, it was more of an average Joe come into power situation, so it took away from the usual superpowered villain stuff you'd expect to see in a D.C. movie.For me, the whole granting wishes thing concept of the movie just felt out of place, and like something that belonged in a whole different type of movie. It just failed to captivate me, and proved to have little entertainment value in terms of being the focal point of a superhero movie.Visually then ""Wonder Woman 1984"" was all there, just like the 2017 movie was. So the visual effects team definitely worked their magic with this 2020 movie, no doubt about that.While I have now seen ""Wonder Woman 1984"" once, I doubt that I will be returning to watch it a second time, as the storyline just felt out of place and too weak for a movie for Wonder Woman.My rating of ""Wonder Woman 1984"", sadly, lands on a very mediocre five out of ten stars.",0,1,-1,0,0,1,1

Wonder Woman 1984,"So I finally figured out why this movie is called Wonder Woman 1984. That's because it takes its inspiration from the pre-Marvel Cinematic Universe superhero movies that are adaptions of the comics in name only. I'm looking at you, Supergirl, which came out in 1984*.Yes, before superhero movies took over the world, we got movies like Superman IV: The Quest for Peace and the Spider-Man and Captain America TV movies (and Superman III and the Cannon Captain America too, while we're at it).In 1984, we were lucky if we got a great superhero film.In 2020, we forgot what that time was like.Directed by Patty Jenkins from a script she wrote with Geoff Johns** and Dave Callaham, based on a story by Johns and Jenkins, this is a movie that people have really hated with a passion. So many people have said that it's campy, but they really have no idea what that word means. This is in no way the 1960's Batman TV series. It's not Barbarella. We could only dream that it could be a tenth of a percent as campy as Danger: Diabolik or Flash Gordon***.It's the very definition of a movie that has no idea what it wants to be, the story that it wants to tell or how the characters will learn or grow along the way. It only hamfistedly smashes plot points - Honesty is good! Lies are bad! - with all the subtlety of Obnoxio the Clown.It all starts in the home of the Amazona, Themyscira, where a kid version of Diana Prince competes against the older Amazons and learns that cheating won't get her anywhere. This is generally called foreshadowing, but again, this is a plot point hammered home so completely that even Bizarro would find himself saying, ""Me not get it!""We move to 1984, sixty-six years after we last saw our heroine in the last movie, and she's spent the decades pining for Steve Trevor (Chris Pine), who sacrificed himself to save everyone from a bomber filled with poison. Now she's the senior anthropologist at the Smithsonian, working alongside the mousy Barbara Ann Minerva (Kristen Wiig) when she's not foiling robberies at malls that look so garishly 1980's that Nightwing's first costume would fit right in.Trust me. I was in the 1980's. I was eight when they started. Everything in here is exactly the 80's marketing people think the 80's are. Anachronism abounds to the point that I was expecting Rip Hunter to show up and ask Wonder Woman to fix things. ""Diana! Operation Wolf came out in 1987, not 1984! Per Degaton is ruining everything! The Cro-Mags didn't release The Age of Quarrel until 1986 and that kid already has the shirt! Cronos is destroying the time-space continuum! That man is walking a goldendoodle, which wasn't bred until 1990! Monarch is back!""That's when this film's McGuffin comes into play. The Dreamstone can give anyone their wish. Wonder Woman wants Steve back. Barbara wants to be Diana. And Max Lord (Pedro Pascal) wants it all.Yes, Max Lord. The guy who was behind the Justice League International before coming back to kill off Blue Beetle and ruin the DCU for so many people in Countdown to Infinite Crisis.While this isn't a mainstream character, it doesn't have to be. But the truth is, Wonder Woman 1984 is more Max Lord's movie than it is Diana's. He's the one that takes the journey, who changes and becomes a better person at the end once he sees where his bad decisions have taken him. And much like 1984, the year when comic book movies had nothing in common with their print inspirations, he's Max Lord in name only****. He's more Donald Trump than L-Ron's best pal, but that's completely intentional.Within a few days, Lord has pretty much ruined the world with wish after wish*****. Barbara has wished to become an apex predator, a term nobody used in 1984. And Diana has realized that Steve - in another man's body that had sex with Diana without consent, which was a major issue with so many people and something that while upsetting is also something fictional with no way of happening in our reality and to be blunt, we got bigger things to be upset about in 2020 - shouldn't be back from the dead.And that's pretty much it.The biggest sacrifice - Steve going back to death - is made by Steve more than Diana. Barbara never gives up her wish, gets electrocuted and still lives. And Max actually comes out as the person who learns the most, telling his son that he is not a good man.Maybe it's the amount of horror and exploitation films that I watch on a regular basis, but movies are best between 66 and 75 minutes. This one goes near double that and I already told you the whole story in a few paragraphs. It drags. And drags. And then drags some more for good measure.It also doesn't have any real reason to be set in 1984 other than the title and ""Welcome to the Pleasuredome"" by Frankie Goes to Hollywood getting used in one scene. And yes, to be completely OCD, this movie takes place on the Fourth of July and that song was released until October 29 of that year.It's also a $200 million dollar movie that has effects that feel unfinished (just look at the kids turn into obvious dummies when she saves them), a final fight scene that makes the end of Ang Lee's The Hulk look well lit and invalidates much of what we knew of Wonder Woman in Justice League, which claims that she was in hiding the whole time. As for those who claim continuity doesn't work, the old DCU was the most continuity heavy universe ever. Ask Ambush Bug. And continuity is a major reason why the MCU works so well.That said, Gal Gadot is fine as Wonder Woman, for all she is given to do. Kristen Wiig is playing Kristen Wiig and if you told me that this was the same character she was essaying in the Anchorman sequel, I would have believed you. And I guess Pascal is fine, but by the end of this movie, I was moved to ennui and struggling to say anything nice.I mean, go back and watch that fight scene in the mall. It has almost sitcom level mugging in it. I mean, the worst part for me was when Steve is amazed by an escalator and a subway train. The first movie was set in London during the First World War and all of those things existed there at that time. Maybe Steve is just a moron.There you go. I've spent more time figuring this movie out than it really deserved. Let's get back to Jess Franco movies, people.*But some really great comic films came out in 1984. One is based on a comic strip that not many people know called Sweet Gwendoline by John Willie and that would be the strangely great The Perils of Gwendoline in the Land of Yik Yak. The other two aren't based on any comic book but get the tone perfect and those would be The Adventures of Buckaroo Bonzai Across the 8th Dimension and The Toxic Avenger.**Who actually wrote some decent comics every once in a while, like DC's JSA.***Which is the answer to the question, ""What are Sam's two favorite comic book adaptions?""****Just like how its mentioned that the Dreamstone comes from Dolos, The Duke of Deception, who was the first major challenge that Diana faced pst-Crisis.*****One of those wishes is to get his company back from Simon Stagg, who we all know - I'm joking, like four or five of us know - is the father-in-law of Metamorpho.",-1,0,-1,0,-999,0,0
Wonder Woman 1984,"Greetings again from the darkness. Some of the key elements that make Wonder Woman appealing is that she's smart, she's nice, she's dedicated to doing good, she's grounded in her history, and her use of her powers makes sense (in a comic book kind of way). Most of that holds true in filmmaker Patty Jenkins' sequel to her 2017 blockbuster WONDER WOMAN. So why did that one work so well, while this one falls short? It's not an easy question to answer, though it could be as simple as having the wrong target.Gal Gadot returns as Diana Prince, and this time she's plopped into 1984 (the year, not the novel). This creates a cornucopia of opportunity for social commentary and satire from Ms. Jenkins and her co-writers Geoff Johns and Dave Callaham. After all, it was the era of atrocious popular music, outlandish fashion, and a relentless pursuit of greed by the ""me"" generation. The film pounces on each of these by using the return of Diana's main squeeze, Steve Trevor (Chris Pine), as a device for highlighting the absurdity of belly bags and pastel tank tops for men. In the first movie, the WWI pilot wakes up in Themyscira, and this time, he just kind of materializes in the year of GHOSTBUSTERS, shopping malls, and President Ronald Reagan. While this certainly qualifies as extreme culture shock, the parade of outfits and Steve's wide-eyed tour through the city are over-the-top, even for their attempted comedic effect.Over-the-top also describes the film's two main villains. Pedro Pascal (""Game of Thrones"") plays TV hypester and con man Maxwell Lord. He's a greedy, self-centered man willing to do anything to get ""more"". Kristen Wiig is Barbara Minerva, a bumbling, forgettable klutz who works at the same museum as Diana. She simply wants to be cool like Diana and have people acknowledge her existence. Things shift quickly thanks to the Dreamstone sitting in Barbara's in-box waiting for research. What follows is more than two hours of seeing the fallout of people having their wishes come true. If you've learned anything about human nature during this pandemic year, then you won't be surprised at how people react to gaining power.Maxwell Lord is not dissimilar to Lex Luthor in SUPERMAN (1978), as his goal is ultimate power and control - though to what end, he's not sure. Barbara Minerva was never really power hungry, but a taste of it was much to her liking, and she transitions to The Cheetah for Wonder Woman's biggest fight scene. There is also a message about what one sacrifices to have their wishes come true. This aspect of the film could be psychoanalyzed were one so inclined. Lord's relationship with his son is convoluted, and the early Barbara is a mess ... making their ""sacrifices"" a bit less obvious than that of Diana.The opening sequence is the one this viewer most enjoyed. Spectacular camera work takes us to a competition on Themyscira, as a very young Diana (Lilly Aspell returns) goes against the grown warriors, while Antiope (Robin Wright) and Hippolyta (Connie Nielsen) look on and teach hard life lessons. Not only do these actors return, but most of Ms. Jenkins' WONDER WOMAN crew is back, including cinematographer Matthew Jensen. The changes include Film Editor Richard Pearson and Hans Zimmer provides the new score. Some of the dialogue is tough to take. As an example, Diana says ""I don't know what to think, Steve. I only hope I'm wrong."" And later, Steve explains, ""Flying is easy. It's only wind and air."" Dialogue like this makes us want to renounce our own wishes. It may be one film later than it should have been, but Ms. Jenkins does deliver a much-appreciated cameo at film's end, and if nothing else, it leaves us wondering, 'what would you give up for a wish?'",0,1,0,0,0,1,0
Wonder Woman 1984,"... in that I can enjoy a good one, but film noir and precode are really my preferred genres. From that perspective, I don't think that this movie is nearly as bad as everybody says.There are big plot holes. Why is everybody wearing heavy coats and then suddenly it is the Fourth of July? Why is it OK to kidnap some random man's body from his life? Did he have a family who wondered where he was? Was he losing a job he wasn't showing up to? And how does a WWI pilot - the resurrected Steve - know how to operate a 1980s airplane? This last one is basically the same problem with Independence Day, a much worse movie that people apparently loved.In fact, reading the negative reviews, THAT is what I expected - Independence Day 2020. Hammy acting, over the top dialogue, shrill characterizations, and stuff that doesn't make sense on a much bigger scale than what I actually saw in this film. Maybe it is because people expected more action - this film is more philosophical. Maybe because folks expected more Wonder Woman in a movie that bears her name.About being philosophical, there was one thing I noticed, maybe it was intentional, maybe not. Pre magical powers, Max Lord is a greedy guy, but he is tethered to humanity through the unconditional love of his son. It is what ultimately brings him back from the brink. Kristen Wiig's character, Barbara, is a mousy timid person with zero confidence who was probably bullied as a child. Nobody ever helps her - even when she is being assaulted - unless they take pity on her. It wouldn't be because she means anything to them. When she gets the power to be like Wonder Woman she goes completely wild. For the first time in her life she has confidence and strength. And she is totally unconnected to humanity because nobody ever cared about her or even noticed she was alive, and so the feeling is understandably mutual. So she would die before she would give up that power and go back to what she was - a nobody. So think about that if you ever decide to bully somebody - adult or child. It has lasting consequences.Before all of this happened you would have said that Barbara is much more integrated into society than Max is. That's because she didn't have the strength or confidence to NOT be integrated into society.The Han Zimmer score was on point but not overpowering, the acting spot on. I think it is the large as well as smaller themes of the plot and the fact that the CGI seemed amateurish that people noticed. I noticed it. And I've always been a rather easy grader.",0,1,0,0,1,1,0
Wonder Woman 1984,"This movie has some really bad points. It isn't the worst action hero movie ever. It's 80% bad with some redeeming qualities here and there.
Firstly the bad points:
1. The story. This silly ""wish"" premise is weak and wears thin very fast. Be careful for what you wish for. Even a 1984 movie wouldn't have such a simplistic premise. It gets too overblown at the end. The writers really did a bad job. It's beyond low mentality and cliched. And things really fizzle out at the climax.
2. Long winded scenes. Many scenes could have been cut in half to keep the momentum going. From the overlong competition in the beginning, almost every scene could have been trimmed by a quarter.
The good points:
1. Gal Gadot is watchable and likeable - she could read the phone book and it would be watchable.
2. Pedro Pascal of Narcos is the villain here and he looks quite different - good that he has a big movie role.
3. Kristen Wiig has a remarkable transformation and her character is quite interesting.
4. Watch out for Lynda Carter.
The cast is good but they can't save a bad story. Chris Pine looks a bit haggard.
5. The production values are fine - it is a big budget movie. And the cinematography is good.They had better think carefully about who they get to make Part 3.",-1,1,-1,-1,0,1,1
Wonder Woman 1984,"I DO wonder what this would've been like an hour shorter.Much better! Wish granted!Wish wishes were true. Then I'd wish for more Wonder Woman in this Wonder Woman movie. You will have to settle for just Diana for the majority of the film. Wonder Woman, herself, is in this about 20 of 151 LONG minutes and there's even an hour and 21 minutes that pass without an appearance.But, that's not to say this was a bad movie. It was good, just...so...damn...long. It's the classic setup villains superhero sequel, like Batman Returns, only: every scene is probably 4-6 minutes past it's point. Everything drags when we already know where everything's headed.Wonder Woman somehow doesn't reappear into society until 1984 and after her latest appearance, she discovers an ancient rock that grants wishes. Diana (Wonder Woman,) her new friend and a con man get wishes and like they always say: Be careful for what you wish for.The movie starts off great, but then seems to completely slow down for the next 2 hours until a weird, but so-so final act that leaves me with a desire to never see this again. The end credit scene is worth it, but only if you already have HBOMax and you can fast forward to the end.That all said, it's not a complete waste and it IS worth watching once. The first Wonder Woman and Batman v Superman: The Ultimate Edition were WAY better. This is better than the theatrical cut of Justice League AS A MOVIE, but Wonder Woman was used much better there than in this film.This just should've been edited down more and we needed to see more of the main title character in the first follow-up sequel. That's what sequels are made for: doubling down on the first one.

Wonder Woman 1984,"I'm starting to wonder about a lot of the reviews but then again I probably shouldn't be all that surprised that we have a heap of people posting one star reviews that, surprise surprise, only have one review - this film. I guess IMDB needs to have some sort of honour system, and maybe start to relegate a lot of these one review wonders down the list (and I probably shouldn't be all that surprised that a lot of these one review wonders also get an awful lot of upvotes - no doubt they are upvoting themselves). To be honest, I used to have a bit of faith in the IMDB rating system, but of late I have come to question its authenticity (particularly since there are a bunch of lowly rated movies, namely Adam Sandler ones, that seem to pull in a bucket load of money).Well, this is a sequel, not surprisingly, and it doesn't seem to have done as well as the previous film, but then again sequels rarely do. I personally wasn't keeping my hopes up all that much, namely because while the first one was okay, I couldn't see them pulling the same response with the sequel. On the other hand, a lot of people don't seem to fully understand the impact that the Rona has had on the theatre going public, especially since there are a bunch of cinemas around the world that are still shut, and those that aren't shut are either half full, or people just aren't going to them.Anyway, the film is about wishes and instant gratification. The thing is that instant gratification can bring about terrible consequences as well, and one of the interesting things we see is how the city (Washington) slowly degenerates throughout the film, as if for each wish that is granted, there is an unexpected side-effect. Well, the movie spells that out, though that is something that seems to come about at the end. Mind you, it isn't as if all of the consequences are necessarily unwanted, or concerning to the characters.I wouldn't necessarily say that the film is confronting, but it does go a way to make us think about our desires, and the impact that they can have on others. I guess that in part is why a lot of people didn't particularly like the film, namely because it does have a means of confronting us in a way that makes us feel uncomfortable, and also seems to work to challenge that selfish side of us.Personally, I liked it, though I do have to admit that there are aspects of the film that seemed to be a bit annoying. Like, sure, I accept that Wonder Woman has her invisible plane, and it is introduced here, but that seems to be quickly scrapped just to have her fly like superman, which I found to be somewhat annoying. However, in the end, I felt that the film actually wasn't all that bad, and the theme working behind the scenes, as well as the steady degradation of society. Oh, and I thought Cheetah was pretty cool as well, especially how we see her personality changing as the film progresses.As for Max Lord, there is an awful lot about the character, and they way that he was developed, that really added to the film. This is especially the case that he doesn't just make a wish, but becomes the conduit for granting wishes. Yet, as the film progresses, we see that there is much more to the character then meets the eye, and this is especially the case in the final confrontation. The way that the character was dealt with was definitely much, much better than a lot of other films that I have seen.Yeah, it's not bad, and I consider it worth seeing, though it seems that not many others are really in the same boat as me.",0,1,0,1,0,1,1
Wonder Woman 1984,"Superhero movies have gone meta. ""Bloodshot"" (2020) with its control-room of computer programming in the vein of ""Déjà Vu"" (2006) for its comic-book fare, ""Glass"" (2019) with the orchestration of superheroic action for the cameras, and Marvel's ""Spider-Man: Far From Home"" (2019) with visual-effects projection. Now, DC has done it with ""Wonder Woman 1984,"" a blockbuster picture that seemed destined to be streamed into the personal screens of audiences at home, or perhaps that's only what one wished for in these troubling times, as the movie is about just that, of wish fulfillment transmitted to televisions around the world. (""Joker"" (2019) also prominently featured TV to similar and different effect.) This might be another contrarian opinion, as this sequel is already receiving poorer reviews than the first ""Wonder Woman"" (2017), and given that the other aforementioned superhero flicks weren't critical darlings either--even the performance of ""Far From Home"" was comparable to what I consider its inferior predecessor, ""Homecoming"" (2017), and ""Joker"" received considerable rebuke for a Best Picture nominee--but ""Wonder Woman 1984"" is an improvement upon the prior entry.Granted, there's nothing in ""Wonder Woman 1984"" quite like the first movie's No Man's Land scene; although the flying scenes in this one are good, they're not so awe-inspiring. But, then, the sequel doesn't entirely devolve into a bloated boss fight in the third act, either, whereas did ""Wonder Woman."" I like smart pictures, as I'm sure many others do, too, but it's clear such doesn't mean the same to everyone. The first movie was mostly a war genre piece with a superhero origin story grafted on--""Captain America: The First Avenger,"" but with magical Amazons and fish-out-of-water humor as Diana Prince learned about the world of man. Entertaining but not especially clever, except for perhaps that it was framed within a photograph as a nested story. The brilliance of an ever more reflexive work such as its sequel is basically in the tradition of the Greek gods that the DC comics are rooted in, that aphorism--or general truth--from the Delphi Oracle: know thyself. That's the ken of a movie that alludes to its own deconstruction; it's known to be exactly what it is.That there's the usual CGI, action-packed spectacle on top of this self-awareness, all the better. It's their raison d'être, after all. Sure, it's nothing new in this regard--at least as far as I can tell, and, indeed, the figures are considerably weightless in their movements, as some have criticized, but there's fun to be had here. I like the silly lightness of the opening heist in a mall--a very 1980s setting and the first of many retro gags for the decade in the same vein as another female superhero flick, ""Captain Marvel"" (2019), with its placement in the 1990s (and the nostalgia of ""The Guardians of the Galaxy"" (2014) before that). This is added to a gender and character reversal of the babe-in-the-woods act from the first movie onto Steve Trevor this time. Plus, the climactic fighting isn't as exhausting here. I find it funny, too, that Diana dresses in the armor of a bird to fight a cat (or ""Cheetah""). Best of all, though, there is no question or red herring now to the existence of the gods. They're real, and they're fully integrated in the narrative, from Themyscira and the ancient or classical world to Washington D.C. and the 1980s. Even the end-credits scene fits and isn't merely a stupid joke or sequel teaser. It recalls TV, too.The dream stone is remarkably congruent with the prominent placement of TV in the narrative and reflective of the making of these superhero movies, which are all about people doing the physically impossible--the godly--and via CGI and digital film, the photographically impossible. And, then, we have the magic of personal screens, which now include computers of phones in our pockets, but began with the boob tube, a life-altering magic box for good and bad that regardless changed the world. I can see how some might consider the picture as messy as its delayed release schedule: part 4th-of-July fireworks display and part winter-solstice celebration, part theatrical blockbuster and part enticement for streaming subscriptions. Nothing is really made, probably fortunately, of a character portrayed by an Israeli actress (the wonderful Gal Gadot) getting involved in a land and oil conflict in Egypt (not that it'd matter for those who hate the series on the basis of sex or ethnicity anyways), and, more disappointingly, nothing comes of the sapphic tension between Gadot's Diana and Kristen Wiig's Barbara, which is all-too-quickly turned into talk of boys. Despite the TVs and 1984 setting, not much is done with the Orwellian connection, either. And, from Egypt, the threat to civilization moves to riots in D.C. and a White House battle beside an idiotic president. Amazon Olympiad in a mall. For all the channel changing, the consistent throughline remains in a wish granted around the world, whether you renounce it or not, of gods on the screen.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1
Wonder Woman 1984,5 out of 5 stars.Wonder Woman 1984 is an awesome sequel which takes the story of wonder woman in 1984 that has her trying to stop a mad men Max Lord (Pedro Pascal) and Barbara/Cheetah (Kristen Wiig).I will say the film is not as big like the first film which is greater when it comes to big action sequences. WW84 does deliver a more emotional meaningful depth to the story which is a huge escapism towards our real world events.The story is awesome. Has a meaningful story. It may be slower than the first. Diana still feels like she is missing something in life. After the events of the first film and losing Steve. Without going into details. Barbara is an awkward and campy personality lady who works with Diana. But she always envys Diana. Max Lord is a want to be businessman. Who wants to be powerful. Is a bit of a con man. But is trying to be successful to his sons eyes. The story does have Diana coming across Steve. And them trying to stop Max Lord from taking over the world. Which has consequences with the actions he is taking. The story can be a bit emotional. Especially during the climax. The villain is also one of those emotional build ups.The action sequences is exciting and awesome. May be less action than the first film. But still delivered. The opening Amazonian scene as they are having an Olympic event was just awesome. Wonder Woman is still awesome in the action sequences. Plus with the exciting car chase in the desert highway was thrilling. The brief fight scene with Wonder Woman and Cheetah is great but short.The visual effects is great. The 1984 setting is fun and colorful. And a bit campy with the costumes and looks. Music score Hans Zimmer is better than the first movie which delivers a new theme and score.Patty Jenkins direction is great. She build up an emotional story and delivering some action. There is a fun cameo mid credit scene. The ending is emotional and has that happy ending feel that is worth it.,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
Wonder Woman 1984,"Wonder Woman 1984 is a film that had a lot of mixed staff in it some were good but also some were bad.Lets start with good,Gadot was again as Wonder Woman and every time she was on screen i felt happy cause it feels like she was born for this role.Pine was also good and he again had great chemistry with Gal and when they were together they shined in a great way.Wigg as Cheetah was fine but she was left kind a underlooked in a film,Special effects were also pretty weak in some scenes and villain Max Lord was cartoonish at some moments.Wonder Woman 1984 is a film weaker then original but Gal and Pine saved it",0,1,0,0,-999,0,-1
Wonder Woman 1984,"Like the first one I'm a bit indifferent about what I'm seeing but this movie does not have the stigma of the fact that I've been waiting so very long for a Wonder Woman movie. I already got that.I do love the fact that this movie is movie is stepping further away from the darkness that began the DC Extended Universe. I loved Man of Steel but I felt it was being too much like the Dark Knight which is not the persona of all the DC superheroes.What is a concept of all the DC superheroes is that they are big and epic. Wonder Woman without a doubt is saving the world in this one, that's the purpose: giving it all to save the world and I felt that from this movie, something that I do not feel in other movies like this, necessary.Like a good sequel everything is a little better. Both Patty Jinkins and Gal Godat seem more comfortable making this flick. The actions scenes are better I like how Wonder Woman fights in this one. Way better than the last one. At the same time its far more sappier than the last film. Wonder Woman's moral campus and purpose as a hero is never overshadowed by superficial bells and whistles. Not sure how I really feel about that cause I love how Captain America's moral code can be found at the end of his right hook. Not to through shade on how in WW84 Diana takes a defensive strategy, never using her powers in violence no matter how violent the enemy is and only uses her power to stop the enemy with not intensions of destroying. How very Bruce Lee in the philosophy if not the movement.Kristin Wiig as Cheetah was perfect. I first felt like they were trying to mimic something that the old Batman movies did with the bad guys. Her origin resonated with that of Catwoman in Batman Returns with the fun and playful persona of Jamie Foxx's Electro in Amazing Spider-Man 2. Plus, I feel like I've been waiting all my life to watch Wonder Woman go up ageist Cheetah in a movie and WW84 brings it!Like Batman Returns and Amazing Spider-Man 2 Wonder Woman 1984 boost more than one baddie and after finishing the second season of the Mandalorian I could not wait to see its star Pedro Pascal in anything. Maybe it's my lack of knowledge on Wonder Woman, but I do feel they got to be careful not to run out of Rogues for her to face (She's no Flash who like Batman has an endless supply). Pascal's Max Lord felt like Thanos in human skin and it works well.I will say I did not think the movie was 80s enough for a movie with 1984 in its title. Though those moments with Steve Trevor as a man out of time are funny I'm very surprise how subtle they kept the whole thing, or rather when it comes to paying homage or using it for humor. I think they had the political atmosphere of 1984 covered.If you liked Wonder Woman than WW84 is something to check out. It's...Wonderful!!Thanks HBO Max!!",1,1,0,0,0,1,0
Wonder Woman 1984,"In 1984 valiant Diana Prince chooses to fly solo and works under the radar at the Smithsonian, but in a world where nothing good can be born from lies, she secretly continues her righteous crusade against injustice. Unexpectedly reunited with lost love Steve Trevor, she faces off against disgruntled loser and businessman Max Lord, as well as dorky gemologist-turned-apex predator Barbara Minerva in a conflict with dire consequences. Overlong, unremarkable sequel with a bland villain and clichéd central message finally kicks into gear as it nears the finale, but it really could've done without such an aimless, lingering first half. Offers the expected 80s anachronisms and some warm moments courtesy of Gadot and Pine, but it lacks an adventurous spirit or thrilling action scenes to complement them. **",0,1,0,0,0,1,-1
Wonder Woman 1984,"I may sound like I hate this movie, but I don't. It's no way a bad movie, but comparing it to the first Wonder Woman(2017), there is no contest that was the better film. Wonder Woman 1984 tells an interesting story, but it simply goes nowhere, it's like the filmmakers didn't know where to go the character, and there go have been so much you could have done and didn't.The chemistry between Gal Gadot and Chris Pine is still there, but him coming back cause of a wish seem like potenial wasted. Pedro Pascals performance feels like he is in a different movie, and he just seriously overacts, to the point where it became a headache. Kristen Wiig has the Cheetah is enjoyable, and I loved watching her back story, but didn't like she when quickly became a side character. Action scenes are pretty good, and Gal Gadot is great has Diana/Wonder Woman. Despite it's faults I don't consider Wonder Woman 1984 a bad movie, but not something I'd sit through again.

Wonder Woman 1984,"A Moment of Mockery For the ""Everything is Political All the Time Reviews""I think I need to do the thing where I say that this is empowering, super empowering what with it being the FIRST EVER strong female lead and the FIRST EVER female action hero in a movie EVER...... because isn't that what we are doing for every female led movie these days?Wait, no, because it's problematic, right? I mean, Gal is Jewish, and that is problematic. And WW is in a heteronormative loving relationship with a Ciss white male and that is problematic too. And, Wiig is a woman AND a bad guy and that is problematic, right? I mean, all of that is super problematic because it caters to the far right... right? So I'm supposed to hate it because of that, right?No, no, no, no, because the other bad guy, he maybe slightly resembles Trump, so that makes it OK to like it because it might be making commentary about Trump and Orange Man Bad and... I'm so confused.What I want to say is that I have read conflicting critic's opinions on this and I don't know which is the right think way to review it!!!!!You know what, I THINK IT'S BEST THAT WE TOTALLY IGNORE THE POLITICS AND JUST REVIEW THE MOVIE AS A MOVIE:Well.... it's too long. I mean I liked the film, but there was too much not story in it that could have, and needed to be trimmed... or at least replaced with MORE story.And then the Fx.... they were CLEARLY going for an 80s super hero movie ala Supergirl feel, every now and again and, as where it is clear as day that they are doing that... it's 2020 and from reading the NON political reviews it is clear that people don't get that.... because everything is literal and homages that do NOT mock the past tend to go over people's heads.... because.... our collective IQs have dropped to 90.So it's something I liked, but I can see where people are complaining about it.Gadot, well, she made a huge sacrifice in this, she got everything she wanted and had to give it away, and there are times in this where you really feel that lose... and kudos to that. But... you sort of feel that the emotion should have been carried further and that not doing so was a bit of a lost opportunity, in the most dramatic sense.But there is still a lot more of an emotional connection to WW in this, and that is a pretty big step above the first film. I feel like I related to her a little more in this, she was more human and less goddess, and that is welcomed.The opening was a little too much ""We've seen this before"" and the surprise at the end was a little too much ""we saw this coming,"" but still welcomed even if the clue dropped half-way through made it an obvious guess.Over all, it was a lot better and had more depth than the first outing, and was able to add 80s cheese without falling into the ""we are going to mock the decade for being in the past,"" trope that so many other shows and movies have fallen into.I don't get the non political 1 star reviews, it has it's faults, but not as many as they are making out. I don't respect the political reviews.And... for it's faults, the connection you can make and the additional humor more than make up for it all.",1,1,0,1,0,0,0
Wonder Woman 1984,"Wonder Woman 1984(WW1984) is the new DC fantasy sequel to the 2017 film Wonder Woman. This time Diana Prince (Gal Gadot) is still mourning the loss of her lover Steve Trevor(Chris Pine who died in the first movie). But when a mysterious artifact is found at the workplace where Diana works all hell breaks lose as an evil oil tycoon named Maxwell Lord(Pedro Pascal) and a nerdy woman named Barbara (Kirsten Wigg) want the power of the artifact as it wishes for the other person's desires,especially when Diana wishes Steve to come back(he becomes reincarnated as someone else..just don't ask).Will Wonder Woman save the man she loves once more and defeat the new villains or will she sacrifice herself?.Overall it was a good sequel but it's not as great as the original one which was alot more better since it had more action sequences and the plot was more easier to follow here in this sequel it's like I was watching an episode of Quantum Leap(with Steve becoming someone else). Also parts of it was like The Amazing Spiderman 2 with Barbara being so nerdy and goofy just like Max from TASM2. The CGI of Cheetah was meh as we only seen her at night and that's it. Also back to Steve Trevor coming back from the dead I was like ok so Diana saw this guy as Steve and everyone else sees Steve as the guy his possessing. It just drove me crazy as it took me a while to get the jest of it. As well as that we get to see a young Diana again and I thought that the film was a time travelling film.If you love Wonder Woman then watch the 2017 one instead as that was far more superior. Also stay tuned for the credits as a familiar face shows up.C-",-1,0,-1,-1,-999,0,-1
Wonder Woman 1984,"I saw ""Wonder Woman 1984"", starring Gal Gadot-Keeping Up With the Joneses, Knight and Day; Chris Pine-A Wrinkle in Time, Into the Woods; Kristen Wiig-SNL_tv, Paul and Pedro Pascal-The Mandalorian_tv, Kingsman:The Golden Circle.
This is a sequel to the 2017 Wonder Woman that is written & directed by Patty Jenkins-she directed both, but only wrote this one-and it takes place in 1984, about 70 years after the first one. I'm personally interested in seeing how it does at the box office because it is being released in theaters and on HBOMax on the same day so we will see how many show up-a movie like this should be seen in the theaters, in my opinion. Gal returns as Wonder Woman, as does Chris in his role of Steve Trevor. If you saw the first one, you know what happened to Chris, and it is explained how he shows up here. Kristen plays a fellow co_worker of Gal's-in her secret identity as Diana Prince-and Kristen later becomes The Cheetah, thanks to Pedro. Pedro plays Max Lord, the main villain that wants to control the world after he acquires some power from an ancient artifact. For all the comic book nerds-like myself-Pedro's powers are similar to the ones he has in the books, but they are not exactly the same. There are several 'nods' to the Wonder Woman history and as the end credits start, there is a scene that should not be missed. But, there is no scene at the very end. Overall, it's a good sequel and I heard that Patty Jenkins has said that she would only do a third Wonder Woman movie, if it was shown in theaters-believe it or not, some people are against the same day streaming.
It's rated ""PG-13"" for action and violence and has a running time of 2 hours & 31 minutes.
Although Wonder Woman is not my favorite hero-that honor goes to Batman-I do like her and Gal's portrayal is great. I would buy this movie on Blu_Ray.",1,1,1,1,0,1,0
Wonder Woman 1984,"After months and months of anticipation Wonder Woman 1984 has finally made its way to the UK and I went back to the cinema today to see it and here is my review. The premise of the film is set in the year 1984 and sees Diana Prince trying to get on with her life as new threats emerge to challenge her.Main Character
I remember when Gal Gadot was cast as Wonder Woman, most of us out there were like she looks the part but can she act the part and without a shadow of a doubt she is perfect as Wonder Woman and it is the role she was born to play. She brings so much life to this character and you really care about Diana and really want her to succeed, her character takes interesting twists and turns and it feels like an appropriate development from the previous film and credit to Gadot for that.Supporting Characters
Chris Pine reprises his role as Steve Trevor and I wasn't sure about this after what happened to his character in the previous film but it really works and is a real highlight of the film. Pine and Gadot have superb chemistry together and it is even better here then it was in the previous film and that is because both of them are having so much fun together and it is really nice to see and works for the story the film is trying to tell. Kristen Wiig plays Barbara Minerva and I thought she did a really good job in the film, I must admit I wasn't sure at first but as the film goes on she gets better and better and her character is one you can feel a bit of sympathy for and you understand the actions she takes and credit to her for a strong performance here. Pedro Pascal plays Maxwell Lord and he is fantastic here, the trailers make it out that he is just a cheesy villain but he is far from that, he is the most interesting character in this film and they do so much to make him a memorable antagonist and one that will be remembered. I think with The Mandalorian we have maybe forgotten just how good Pascal is and this film is here to remind people just how charismatic and amazing an actor that he is.Story
The story for this film is fantastic and one of the best in recent comic book films. The relationship between Steve and Diana is really well developed and better handled here then it was in the first film, mixed with the interesting characters of Barbara & Lord provides a fascinating story that feels appropriate in 2020. It really pulls on the emotion and especially in current times it feels like the story people need and one that will resonate with audiences. A film like this shows that sometimes having less characters but really developing them is a much better idea and allows you to really get invested in what you are watching.Script
The script is great, this film takes place in the 80s and doesn't hide away from it but it also doesn't cheese the film up too much and feels like the right amount of it. The drama is ramped up and I grew to really care about the characters in the film and the blend felt right all the right through with those deep moments and the lighter moments.Style
As I mentioned above the film does a really good job in making you feel like you are watching the 1980s and it is a fun change of pace from what we are used to for sure. The action scenes are also pretty well done in this film even though there is an over reliance of The Lasso Of Truth, that is a tiny complaint. Though I do have a bigger complaint and that is some of the CGI, these were in the trailers so there not spoilers but it is Cheetah and the Golden Winged Armour. They just don't look very good and the action scene teased in the trailer disappoints and fails to live up to the hype.Overall
Overall, this is a fantastic film that improves on the first film. If you are a fan of Wonder Woman you will really enjoy this film and this is a film you have to experience on the big screen so when you feel comfortable go out and support cinemas and this film by seeing it.",1,1,1,1,0,1,-1
The Midnight Sky,"It's 2049 in the Arctic Circle. A science station is being evacuated as an apocalyptic event spreads throughout the world. Augustine Lofthouse (George Clooney) is the only one staying behind since he has a terminal illness anyways. He is shocked to find a little girl left behind. Meanwhile, there is a spacecraft returning to Earth from an Earth-like moon orbiting Jupiter. The crew members are Sully (Felicity Jones), Adewole (David Oyelowo), Mitchell (Kyle Chandler), Sanchez (Demián Bichir), and Maya (Tiffany Boone). They are confused with their inability to contact Earth.This looks physically good but ultimately lifeless. In general, there are three stories being told. The flashback to young Lofthouse is rather unnecessary. It adds very little to his story. I assumed that Clooney may be trying to connect it with the little girl but that doesn't happen. The girl and Clooney hold the best part of the movie. The general premise doesn't make sense but if one ignores that, it actually works as a small adventure. There is no way that everybody would evacuate the base for certain doom. I just watched Greenland where people are killing each other for any small chance of a fractionally longer life. Having said that, one can ignore the flawed premise for the sake of the movie. That finally gets to the spacecraft section. It is the least compelling group. Clooney is doing a mix between Gravity and Steven Soderbergh's Solaris. He has great actors and wastes them with paper thin characters. It's a thriller trying to be thrilling and failing. It doesn't help that the ending is a story fading out to whatever. Only Clooney and the little girl serve as good movie material. Even there, the premise screws up the narrative.",0,1,-1,-1,-999,0,0
The Midnight Sky,"OK. What happened. This movie's first half is really engaging. As Augustine and the little girl make their way to transmitting station, it works very well. The bond that develops is sweet and yet terrifying. What happens next plays fast and loose with the first part. I wish we had some idea what happened to the earth. Then there's that space ship heading home and lots of superfluous stuff. Very slow but not really introspective. I'm disappointed in this.",-1,0,0,0,-999,0,-999
The Midnight Sky,"This movie was hyped pretty fairly up, so I must admit that I was expecting something more than what writer Mark L. Smith and director George Clooney managed to deliver.Now, I am not saying that ""The Midnight Sky"" was a boring or bad movie, but I just feel that the movie had the potential to have been so much more in both entertainment value and story. It felt like it was just the tip of the iceberg that was used to make the movie. And it was a shame, because the concept here definitely had a lot of potential.For me it was the prolonged uneventfulness that sort of put an anchor around the movie and held it back. The first two-thirds of the movie just trotted along with much of anything particularly impressive or overly entertaining happening. Sure, this was to establish the story and characters, but two-thirds? It just dragged on for a bit too long. And then the movie exploded into action, but ending as abruptly as it set into action, which left for much to be desired.The storyline was adequate and definitely had a lot to offer, but sadly weren't utilized to its full potential, making for a somewhat meager and mediocre movie experience. Sure, the movie was watchable, but it was not a movie that had me thrilled or impressed. Nor is it a movie that hardly warrants more than a single viewing for me.""The Midnight Sky"" definitely had an impressive assembly of casted actors and actresses, but sadly they weren't given space to spread their wings and showcase the full scope of their talents, given the limitations of the script and storyline.Visually then ""The Midnight Sky"" was definitely an impressive movie, but again there weren't a whole lot of things going on in the first two-thirds of the movie, but if you sit through the last third things definitely pick up.My rating of ""The Midnight Sky"" lands on a very mediocre five out of ten stars. A watchable movie for sure, but hardly an outstanding or particularly memorable movie experience.",0,1,0,0,0,1,1
The Midnight Sky,"The story is so minimal that almost nothing happens. At the end, a chatter said something that appears to be a twist, and I just don't understand anything about the film anymore.

The Midnight Sky,"It is the year 2049 and a disaster has devastated the Earth. An isolated observatory in the Arctic Circle is staffed by one, terminally-ill, scientist.

Little does he know but he has company.Directed by and starring George Clooney, this film had heaps of potential: the intrigue around the disaster, the scientist trying to get help, the crew of the space craft and their adventures. Clooney initially builds an interesting plot with some engaging characters.However, he doesn't know what to do with this solid foundation. Things get drawn out in the middle section - quite a few scenes that were unnecessary and just padding.There's still a chance that the film will go somewhere special but, unfortunately, it doesn't. The ending is quite the damp squib: largely predictable and unprofound.Disappointing.",-1,1,0,-1,0,1,0
The Midnight Sky,"Greetings again from the darkness. Screenwriter Mark L Smith has described his adaptation of Lily Brooks-Dalton's book, ""Good Morning, Midnight"", as a cross between the Oscar-winning GRAVITY (2013) his own THE REVENANT (2015, nominated for 12 Oscars). It's a lofty comparison, and unfortunately, one that doesn't prove out. Two-time Oscar winner George Clooney takes on the dual role of director and lead actor, and it's his first movie role since 2016's MONEY MONSTER.Clooney plays Dr Augustine Lofthouse, a renowned scientist, and the only one staying behind as everyone else evacuates the Arctic Observatory after some unspecified ""event"" as left the earth uninhabitable. Augustine has a terminal disease (also unspecified) and evidently decides to stay behind because he likes drinking alone and self-administering blood transfusions. The drinking alone fun ends when he ""finds"" a stowaway young girl named Iris (Caiolinn Springall in her first film) and must assume the role of father-figure. To complicate matters, Iris doesn't speak.It's 2049, and the film cuts between 3 storylines. While Augustine and Iris and working on a survival plan, we get flashbacks to a time when he was a younger scientist (played by Gregory Peck grandson Ethan Peck) and sacrificing a relationship with Jean (Sophie Rundle, ""Peaky Blinders"") to focus on his career. The third story occurs simultaneously with Augustine and Iris, and involves Aether, a manned spacecraft on a years long mission to determine if Planet K23 can be inhabited by humans. The crew is commanded by Adewole (David Oyelowo, SELMA), and includes his partner, a pregnant Sully (Felicity Jones, THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING), pilot Mitchell (Kyle Chandler, ""Bloodline""), navigator Sanchez (Demian Bichir, THE HATEFUL EIGHT), and rookie astronaut Maya (Tiffany Boone, ""Hunters"").When Augustine learns of Aether and its route back to Earth, he takes it as his responsibility to inform them that they need a new plan. In order to do this, he and Iris must trek across the frozen Arctic tundra through a blinding snowstorm to reach the satellite equipment that will allow communication with Aether. This road trip through a whiteout allows for the best effects during the Augustine/Iris section. Aboard Aether, the crew is relatively non-descript, but there is a spacewalk segment that is quite something to watch thanks to the cinematography of Martin Ruhe. There is also a visually interesting segment featuring blood in zero gravity.So what we have is a three-piece post-apocalyptic science-fiction space survival tale with a surprise twist that won't surprise anyone. It's likely meant as a warning about how we are destroying our planet, and global catastrophe may not easily be solved through space exploration. The film presents an interesting symmetry between the vast wasteland of Arctic winter vs the vastness of space ... neither seem to have borders or boundaries, yet are fraught with dangers. If you pay much attention to the story, you'll likely be disappointed; however, if you watch for the visuals, you should be fine.

The Midnight Sky,"There are shades of John Barry in Alexandre Desplat's suitably galactic score here, but that is, sadly, about all I can say that is good about this derivative sci-fi yarn. I think George Clooney did just about everything but make the coffee as his terminally ill character traverses the arctic wastes to reach a weather station. It might have a transmitter powerful enough to contact an approaching space craft returning from a distant planet that may offer hope for the survival of mankind from some sort of ghastly existential event threatening the world. The ship is manned by a crew including David Oyelowo and a pregnant Felicity Jones but their journey home is made even more perilous by being knocked off course and having to travel through uncharted space - full of dangerous meteor showers. Money has been spent; and it certainly looks good but the two stories don't really gel/relate very well; the characters are very under-developed and the plot is reminiscent of half a dozen other films of this genre where money was no object but poor writing, directing, and to be honest - acting too, wasn't part of the priority either. It's got way too many long beauty shots, spaceship shots, arctic shots - even gun shots - anything, really, to distract us from the lack of a new story. The imagery certainly benefits from a big screen, the rest - from being on the radio!",-1,-999,-1,-1,1,-1,1
The Midnight Sky,"It's no stretch to think that in 2049 an apocalypse has devastated earth. In an enjoyable The Midnight Sky, alone in the Arctic, astronomer Augustine (George Clooney) tries to contact a returning expedition to a habitable exoplanet to warn it not to return. In addition, he has to find someone to care for little stowaway Iris (Caolinn Springall) because he is about ready to die from a disease and there is no place like home anymore.Director George Clooney knows his way around a camera now with impressive set pieces like a blizzard and space ship repair, his way around the story not so much. The sentimental motifs are there including loves left behind, orphaned children, and flashbacks to simpler times.Clooney as actor is commendable: he underplays a scientist who sees the end coming near and accepts his terminal fate. He quietly warms to his little ward enough to try to save her, although, because she has maybe 2 lines, it's tough for the audience to identify with her.Clooney takes another minimalist approach about our destruction of the planet with a few damning lines about what a poor job we've done taking care of it. Hysterics about the lost world are few if any-the population readily abandons Earth for a newer world.The film fumbles a plot point or two when we become slightly confused about the lineage of two players. Having little Iris absent for the last part in order to emphasize other relationships is a loss, albeit this reviewer is an admirer of the minimalist approach to storytelling.Clooney and company channel the spirit of recent Sci-Fi's like Ad Astra, Gravity, The Martian, and Interstellar. Like them, most super hero films, and old E.T., going home is paramount. In the case of The Midnight Sky, it's a tough haul given our penchant for destroying that home.Let's just call it, like It's a Wonderful Life, a cautionary tale at holiday time.",0,0,-1,1,0,1,1

The Midnight Sky,"Greetings from Lithuania.More then once ""The Midnight Sky"" (2020) reminded me of ""Interstellar"" during its 1 h 50 min run time. Similar great idea, performances, craftsmanship. Yet I still prefer ""Interstellar"" way more, because its simply is the best science fiction ever made in my personal opinion.But back to ""The Midnight Sky"" - I found this movie very involving. I did not knew the story nor synopsis - and this story and the way it was told kept me engaged during its whole run time. I love good science fiction, and this movie is one of those. But at the center of everything most important things in this movie I think was its idea, and characters. Its hard to talk about them without spoilers, so I will not. The ending was surprising, and very touching and good. Sacrifices that one makes in order of something grater and last chance to say goodbye to ones we love and being with the during final moments I think its at core of this film. Great score, special effects and acting as well great directing. What a terrific film.",1,0,1,1,1,0,1
The Midnight Sky,"Like, there is a way of making a film in which absolutely nothing happens, and there is a way of doing it quite well. Samuel Becket and Harold Pinter were masters of the genre. George Clooney, unfortunately, isn't. Mind you, I'm not entirely sure if this is what he was trying to get at, but honestly, this movie was just really, really boring. In fact, for most of the time I was just willing it to end, and to end quickly. If there was a point in all of this, I really don't have any idea of what it was.Basically it is about this scientist in the arctic trying to contact this ship that was travelling to Jupiter to check out this planet to see whether it is habitable, but on the way the Earth basically destroys itself. The whole point is attempting to tell them to stay where they are because there is nothing for them to return to. And it is basically two entire hours of this. In fact, there are scenes that make absolutely no sense whatsoever, such as why does he leave the base only to return - there is no explanation, and no reason. Also what is the purpose of that girl he finds - she just seems to be there to provide a person to talk to, even though she doesn't say a word for the entire film.Honestly, I'm really going to have to stop watching these straight to Netflix films (though there is a suggestion that this was a theatrical release, so I'm really, really glad that I didn't go and see it in the cinemas). Yeah, in a way it is pretty bad, and my recommendation would be to save yourself two hours, even if you are doing something while it is playing in the background (you'll pretty much get the gist of the film watching it this way anyway, since much of it doesn't really make all that much sense) and watch something completely different - maybe four episodes of Ash vs The Evil Dead.",-1,0,-1,-1,-1,0,-1
The Midnight Sky,"While set in the future of 2049, ""The Midnight Sky"" seems a depressingly timely release for this pandemic year of 2020. The world is ending... in the movie, for reasons unexplained except that they were caused by man--global warming, nuclear holocaust, or any number of cataclysms of humanity's hubris. It doesn't really matter the exact event for the purposes of the picture, with the result regardless being one of character isolation and regret. George Clooney's scientist is confined to traveling between arctic radio bases, to stay in front of the poisonous air circling the world and to communicate with astronauts secluded in outer space. A lot of quarantining inside and otherwise wearing protective equipment to avoid breathing in the dangerous outside, in other words--sounds familiar, right.Apart from that, this is another Clooney space movie, with him directing as well as starring this time, and which is unfortunately closer to the ""Solaris"" (2002) remake than it is to ""Gravity"" (2013) (I haven't seen ""Tomorrowland"" (2015) yet). It's derivatively competent, but hardly of the import that its big-budget apocalyptic and planet-hopping scenario demands. Playing with memory is promising material, and this is reflected in space by the virtual-reality programs that remind the astronauts of home and on Earth by the scientist's flashbacks. It's readily cinematic: the film-within-the-film virtual reality and the flashbacks necessitating montage. The space mission and the one on Earth further reflect each other even in the space walk and the earthbound journey through snow-swept landscapes. Remembrance and regret is also intertwined with the dying planet and, perhaps, that of the human species (at least, one presumes, without biblical levels of inbreeding). But, it's been done better before in other space-related pictures, such as, say, ""Arrival"" (2016), or the original ""Solaris"" (1972). Moreover, it's disappointing that these recollections don't amount to much more than forgiving a man for abandoning his daughter.",-1,0,0,0,-999,0,0
The Midnight Sky,"The Midnight Sky is a new film directed and acted by Clooney and i will say that he did a better acting job here then a directing one,mostly because this film has a feeling of mixing Gravity and some other films of same type and because of that it didnt felt like nothing new or original at all.In acting he was good and better then his previous roles in history,i still think that his best role was in Gravity and here he showed some signs of that performance.Rest of cast was good but their characters were unexplored and without personality .Midnight Sky is a fine film but it doesnt distant itself from other films similiar to this one",1,1,0,0,0,1,0

The Midnight Sky,"""The Midnight Sky"" (2020 release; 118 min.) brings the story of scientist Augustine Lofthouse. As the movie opens, we are at ""Barbeau Observatory, the Arctic Circle"" and it is ""February 2049, Three Weeks After the Event"". Something is ravashing the globe, a virus or radiation of some sort, and people are evacuating the observatiry, except Lofthouse who is staying put for some reason. Frankly he looks depressed and/or ill. He notices that the spaceship Aether is approaching earth after a 2 year mission to/from a Jupiter moon, and he tries contacting them to stay away from earth... At this point we are 10 minutes into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: after 4 years away from the big screen, George Clooney returns to produce, direct and star in this ambitious sci-fi drama that is the movie adaptation of the novel ""Good Morning, Midnight"" by Lily Brooks-Dalton. I haven't read the book and hence cannot comment on how closely the movie sticks to the book's plot. But what I can say is that the movie, despite all of its super-expensive production sets, never really takes of and just meandors on and on without really going anywhere. There are stretches in the movie that do nothing to advance the plot and simply seem to be there to add some much needed ""action scenes"" (cue: space walk scenes to repair the Aether), except that some of these scenes seem to be lifted straight from ""Gravity"" (also starring George Clooney). It is just baffling. Clooney, sporting a heavy beard, looks much older than he really is, and he looks very tired and ill throughout, as if something is very wrong and off. Felicity Jones plays Sully, on the Aesther spaceship. One of the best things about this movie is the original score, courtesy of Oscar-winning composer Alexandre Desplat. But in the end, this movie simply falls flat, despite its $100 million production budget.""The Midnight Sky"" opened in select theaters 2 weeks ago and soon will be shifting to Netflix only. The Christmas Eve theater screening where I saw this at was attended dismally (4 people in total, including myself). This movie has simply tanked at the box office, pure and simple. Of course if you are into sci-fi and space movies, or are simply a fan of Geroge Clooney, I'd readily suggest you check it out for yourself, and draw your own conclusion.",0,0,0,0,1,0,1
The Midnight Sky,"Production and acting are solid, that's on the plus side, on the con side: a very slow and boring story told. This of course makes the movie almost unwatchable - but if you want to dip fast into the arms of Morpheus (ancient god of sleep) The Midnight Sky might do, but in the case that you want entertainment and/or something to feed your mind, it won't work. Also the twist with the girl is obvious within a couple of minutes, you just have to use your brains. And, of course, the last survivors are a black man and a white woman (mankind will distinct anyway, how a couple should restart mankind is a mystery only the writers can answer) - in this sense I would even dare to call the movie very racist: Asian or South American people for example (like in many movies) do not play any role in this movie: a white woman and a man of African origin man must survive (like in other movies too) - why not an Asian woman and a South-American man for a change? Anyway, The Midnight Sky is a Netflix production like many: hire some known actors, put some money into the production and technical staff and voila you got a new movie. The script!? Not important at all. My rating is 4, but only because of the decent production value I added one point, the movie I would rate a 3 and no more.",-1,1,-1,-1,-999,1,1
The Midnight Sky,"The Midnight Sky: Augustine (George Clooney) is an astronomer who searches for habitable planets. He's in the Arctic at an observatory in 2049 when an Event occurs which kills much of the Earth's population. When the base is evacuated Augustine stays, he hasn't long to live due to a terminal illness. Heck! He could outlive the rest of humanity as they seek shelter under ground. But a young girl Iris (Caoilinn Springall) is left behind, Augustine now has to look after her. Returning from Jupiter is the spaceship Aether, It has confirmed that one of Jupiter's moons is suitable colonisation. But it cannot contact Earth, is unaware of the catastrophe which has struck. Augustine hears a broadcast from astronaut Sully (Felicity Jones) and is determined to communicate with the Aether and so heads off with Iris to another base which has a more powerful antennae.So two odyssey's begin. Augustine and Iris traverse the Arctic ice and tundra; discover a crashed plane , mysteriously full of objets d'art, encounter wolves, brave ice-breaks and the freezing temperatures and blizzards. The astronauts have to deal with an environment even more deadly with equipment failure and space debris strikes. Some great shots of the Aether which looks as if it came from a fusion of Discovery One (2001) and Valley Forge (Silent Running). Tension in both space and the Arctic build as as they approach their destinations.Some great acting from Jones, Clooney and Springall (who remains mute for most of her screen time). Augustine also reflectys on his past life and in flashbacks we see how he lost the love of his life, Jean (Sophie rundle) another scientist, due to his obsessive devotion to his work. The chemistry between Clooney and Springall sparkles when his reserve breaks down and they flick peas at each other. Not just Science Fiction or another apocalypse movie. This is a story of lost love, a lost world, new bonds and some plot twists which you'll have to unwind for yourselves. Directed by George Clooney and written by Mark L. Smith (Overlord, The Revenant) . On Netflix. 8/10.",1,1,1,0,0,1,1
The Midnight Sky,"IN BRIEF: Despite all the lavish showmanship, two stories seem to be caught in a parallel universe in this doomsday drama.JIM'S REVIEW: (RECOMMENDED): In George Clooney's well-crafted sci-fi drama, Augustine Lofthouse is a scientist and loner, a man consumed with space travel and the cosmos. Stationed in the Arctic and dying of cancer, he chooses to stay behind for his last days while all others evacuate for safety during a global disaster. He is alone, except for a mute stowaway girl named Iris who becomes his charge. Meanwhile, a space mission is returning from Jupiter and all transmissions from NASA have mysteriously ceased. Augustine decides to risk his own safety and warn the astronauts not to return to Earth due to apocalyptic circumstances that have doomed their home planet. What we have here is a failure to communicate...not in the film's epic grandeur or in its ambitious vision, but in its fragmented storytelling. The two frontiers never merge seamlessly in this mediative look at life and death in our possible future, but there is still much to admire.Mr. Clooney stars and directs this saga and he does impressive work in both creative areas. Sporting a massive grey beard that David Letterman would envy, the actor gives a poignant performance as this solitary man. His story-line is by far the most compelling, but the film cross-cuts to the space mission which is rather predictable and listless in its pacing. As a director, Mr. Clooney knows how to create action and tension most effectively, and he counteracts those moments some strong poetic symbolism, aided by Alexandre Desplat's lovely melancholy score. He wisely plays down the heroics and hones in on the human drama, although his flashbacks of a younger Augustine lack credibility due to casting issues and further undercut the flow of the narrative. This is no criticism to the acting talents of Ethan Peck (grandson of Gregory)...the actor just has no physical resemblance to the easily recognizable screen persona of a younger Mr. Clooney.Mark L. Smith's screenplay tries to supply his space traveling characters with some depth, but their backstories is conventionally told and lack any element of, dare I say, gravitis. We've seen these action figures in umpteenth space odysseys battling obstacles on perilous missions. Nevertheless, the cast (Felicity Jones, David Oyelowo, Demián Bichir, Tiffany Boone, and Kyle Chandler) do fine work in their sketchy parts. While the outer space CGI and the absolutely stunning camerawork by Martin Ruhe, plus Jim Bissell's superb production design provide the wow factor, it's those blizzard white-outs and tundras scenes that have the emotional impact. Moviegoers get the treat of visiting these two ""polar"" opposite worlds. But though we can reach for the stars, it is the snow and ice that we prefer to endure.The Midnight Sky is an adventurous and thoughtful undertaking by Mr. Clooney and his artisans. This is a stunningly good-looking movie that would have benefited in a wide screen moviegoing experience than the smaller (and more common) streaming capabilities in this year of COVID.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1

The Midnight Sky,"In terms of concept, ""Midnight Sky"" this is highly formulaic. But after all formulas exist for a reason, so that is not always terrible

The Midnight Sky,"Sick scientist Augustine is - probably - the only survivor of an unmentioned catastrophe that wiped out Earth's population. The five-people of an extremely politically correct spaceship crew are - possibly - the only other human survivors and Augustine must stop their return flight to the Earth from K-23, a habitable moon of Jupiter.Sounds very dramatic but the plot moves at glacial pace - appropriately, because Augustine is stuck in the Arctic. On the good side, Clooney plays old and sick convincingly, sporting an unkempt and unflattering white beard, an ever more unflattering Marine haircut, dark under-eyes bags and a sallow complexion.That's the only convincing thing in the movie. The ""dramatic events"" that endanger Augustine's journey from one Arctic station to another seem arbitrarily concocted to add drama. The same applies to events on the spaceship.Not even the presence of a child and of a pregnant astronaut (surely the pinnacle of #MeToo + PC) manages to produce a tinge of real emotion. Despite the trimmings, the ""message"" of the movie is one of regress. Basically, we'd better take care of our families rather than wasting time being prize-winning scientists, which is dumb, because very few can be eminent scientist while everybody can have a family.",-1,1,-1,0,0,-1,-1
The Midnight Sky,"( It's a beautiful space epic. It's has beautiful visuals, a terrific cast and a gorgeous score.)""That's Aether. It's a spaceship. Coming back from a planet that we hoped would be our future. I have to warn them about the conditions on Earth.""Visually stunning and hauntingly contemplative, The Midnight Sky is a meditation on mortality and humanity that's strikingly shot, and beautifully assembled but lacks full depth in its themes and characters, still ultimately delivering a wonderfully fascinating sci-fi film that's engaging and provocative. Score: 83Discussion Points:
Far out this film looks and sounds gorgeous. The cinematography, sound, score, visual effects and production design are all off the charts! Clooney as a director is pretty solid here. Nothing too incompetent nor revolutionary, just solid filmmaking. His performance is gruff and rough and something I've not necessarily seen from him before. The rest of the cast does well with what their given, but that's the films biggest weakness. It's got some great themes and it really angles itself to try and ruminate on humanity, mortality and loss but it just never quite gets there. It's sadly disjointed in its narratives jumping from Clooney's bleak survival crusade to the mysterious spaceship ensembles quest through the unknown. The strongest narrative threads are the quieter moments with Clooney that are bleak and resonate but he's seemingly determined to spend more time not on himself and rather on his actors whom he elicits strong performances from. Regardless of its narrative flaws, this is still a very accessible and engaging sci-go endeavour and I frothed on it.",0,1,1,1,1,0,1

Soul,"Some people may get annoyed when they hear ""another Pixar classic"". And I really try to avoid the term classic, especially with a movie that was just released. How can it already be a classic. Doesn't it have to stand the test of time? And how does Pixar actually achieve what they're doing? How can they keep this up with almost all their output. Even their ""weak"" movies are good by any measure.But this isn't just good! This is epic! Yes I went there! And not just because it is the flavor of the month. I won't bash Wonder Woman 84, even if I feel similar to some who have already seen it - the fact I probably have to wait at least a few weeks until it is officially released in Germany won't make a difference to the criticism: I do believe that it is more effects and show than substance ... but not everyting can be entertaining and so full of Soul like ... Soul/Pixar movies in general.But back to this, which starts off slowly in a way. You may feel differently when you start watching it, especially considering what they do with the ""music"" from the start. But considering all the places this movie takes you (literally and not) ... just wow.And it is about so much! That not just an animated movie can and does go there ... it's incredible. Of course those familiar with Japanese Anime in particular and Studio Ghibli in particular already know this is possible. Don't be offended if you are one of those, if people just start recognizing this and are blissfully unaware of this other world you were aware of aleady. Educate them if you want, don't belittle their experience or the one they get from this or other Pixar efforts.Having said all that and as you can see, I am not going into the story itself. For one I don't like to spoil, but also in this case, it is not so much about the apparent goal of our hero. It is about life itself. Again this is as deep as an animated (kids) movie can go. I can not praise enough what they have done here and how they achieved it. There is still silly humor and other things that make this entertaining. And that balance is finely tuned and mixed. A heartfelt story that I would assume almost everyone can connect with! And that is what makes the Pixar experience so unique - most of the times that is!

Soul,"Pixar never ceases to amaze me. Somehow they've cracked this incredible code which allows them to have profound stories woven in such a way even kids can enjoy. They've found this perfect blend of tapestry which appeals to kids and adults alike. It's remarkable.Joe Gardner (Jamie Foxx) was a middle school music teacher with an eye on his big break. He believed he was born to play jazz and if he could do that for life he would be a happy man. His mother (Phylicia Rashad), on the other hand, thinks Joe should find steady work and stop chasing this dream.Joe finally got his big break when he was asked to fill in for an absent piano player. He crushed his rehearsal and was given the gig right there on the spot. In his jubilation Joe stepped into an open manhole and the next thing we see is a blue, roundish, figure of Joe on a conveyor belt going to ""the Great Beyond."" This couldn't have been a more inopportune time for Joe as he just got his big break.He found a way to stave off the Great Beyond with the help of some other souls--namely Number 22 (Tina Fey). Number 22 is a disembodied soul who never lived because she never found her ""spark."" If Joe can help her find her spark and get her soul patch (not the facial hair) then maybe he can go back to Earth and play in the gig of his life.""Soul"" is funny, insightful, and profound. I thought it wouldn't be as enjoyable once I saw the ""souls"" and the other entities in the netherworld Joe was in. They were of such a cartoon quality that I assumed the story would take on a cartoon quality as well. Thankfully, that was never the case. Yes, the movie had funny moments as it should have, but it never was silly. And even when we got the requisite pensive moment, it wasn't sad or depressing. It's a story of following your passion, but not missing life while you pursue it. I thought the movie came together very well and definitely had a spark.",1,1,1,1,0,1,1

Joe (Jamie Foxx voice)Joe, the hero of Pixar's stunning animation, didn't know that about life until he took the journey in Disney Corporation's Soul. Affirming the everyday business of life and finding one's purpose in that state are what this warm and insightful animation is about, without emphasizing the theme too much or speechifying too obviously.At the beginning, Joe is faced with a decision to accept a full-time middle-school band directorship or play jazz with a well-known singer and her combo. Only when he experiences the end of his life where he should join the quiet line to walk into the Great Beyond does he experience in the Great Before the chance to find his spark of life and his purpose in that life.""It's the Great Before. This is where new souls get their personalities, quirks and interests before they go to Earth."" Counselor JerryWith the assistance of 22 (Tina Fey), who is developing her personality like other small ones in that middle ground, Joe learns to appreciate the small things like a piece of pizza and a small leaf. Armed with that new perception, he is ready to identify his purpose in life.Not one frame of this dynamic polemic is dull, for Pixar's directors, Rick Docter and Kemp Powers, feed endless creative space with characters and sights appealing to a child's love of color and an adult's longing for full-range visuals like lined figures and puffball kids.

Soul,"From the writer-director of Monsters Inc, Up & Inside Out comes another original, ambitious & heartwarming delight that piques the mind and stirs the emotions in ways only the best Pixar films can. An arresting & endearing trip to the afterlife & back, Soul is an affectionately crafted, passionately told & sumptuously animated gem that presents its pioneering studio in splendid form.Co-written & directed by Pete Docter, just like his earlier efforts, the story tackles existential themes but in a fun, accessible & enlightening manner, and also marks Pixar's first attempt to portray African-American life & culture on their rich, warm & distinctive canvas. As often is the case, the characters are scripted with genuine care & heartfelt compassion while the world building is sensible yet breathtaking.First-rate animation is pretty much a default setting when it comes to Pixar films and their latest picture is no exception, for every frame is immaculately rendered and the details are jaw-dropping. Also noteworthy is the ideal lighting, clever wit & swirling score that keeps the tone & vibe in sync. Still, when considering the so many interesting places the film journeys into, the final act feels surprisingly safe & predictable.Overall, Soul is another fascinating blend of emotional storytelling & spellbinding animation from Pixar and delivers all the perks & delights that we expect from the exceptionally creative powerhouse. Pete Docter has now smashed four home-runs in a row and even if his latest may seem like his weakest entry so far, it promises a rewarding time & delivers the desired goods.

Soul,"I do enjoy a movie based around puns, and ""Soul"" is about a Jazzcat who literally becomes a feline focused on playing jazz at a nightclub and about soul music involving spiritual mind-body dualism. That's my preferred eye-rolling examination of the arbitrariness of meaning--not the sophomoric philosophizing on the meaning of life and death that occupies much of the rest this ""Soul.""It's also the first Pixar movie to feature an African-American protagonist, although it took 23 features to do it--five more than the Marvel Cinematic Universe but much fewer than for parent-company Disney (unless one counts ""Song of the South"" (1946), but nobody does, not even Disney). Yet, that's only to put a white voice (Tina Fey) in the black body for much of the runtime as if it were some sort of light, cartoon treatment of ""Get Out"" (2017), or with the blue bodies of the souls, a reverse ""Avatar"" (2009), and to put the black actor's voice (Jamie Foxx) in a non-human animal. To most of the picture's world, his voice is even taken away as a result.Even for a long cartoon, ""Soul"" seems particularly silly to me and more religious, albeit of a goofy sort, than usual. On the other hand, the computer animation looks good, per usual of Pixar, including a cubist-inspired afterlife (or pre-life, I guess). I suppose the theme of confusion and lack of control of one's body may have some resonance with children audiences, but Pixar already did that with personified emotions in ""Inside Out"" (2015). The narrative emphasis on music in ""Soul,"" however, which corresponds neatly with the importance of scores in these animated pictures, raises this one up some.

There are individual scenes which are good, but as a whole, they suck.Soul started to lose me when they had Mother Teresa trying to be a mentor. That's a joke in itself. However, the entire premise for this movie is that some one who is a jazz musician is trying to get his soul bag in to his body because he needs to do this gig. That's fine, there was a movie which did it better called ""Heaven Can Wait"" which was the same exact premise. I actually think they stole the store from that movie.I liked individual scenes, but that's about it. I got up and left the room when the swap souls in the wrong body happened.Sorry Pixar. You suck.",-1,0,-1,0,0,0,0
Soul,"SOUL (2020) :
Movie Review -Pixar's filmography is like handful of diamonds. Every single film is like a diamond with different shape but all shine equally on their own side. Pixar's Soul was awaited since the announcement cause the master director behind Pixar's classics like 'Monsters Inc.', 'UP' and 'Inside Out' Mr. Pete Docter was coming back. Soul promised to be a journey of a lifetime and undoubtedly it fulfills all the promises made before and matches all expectations kept by movie fans.Soul is about a musician, Mr. Joe Gardener who has lost his passion for music is transported out of his body and must find his way back with the help of an infant soul learning about herself. In this journey he realises many unknown facts about himself and then how he transforms into a new soul living person is all that Soul has got to show you. Pete Docter, Mike Jones and Kemp Powers's trio has written a beautiful script that breaks certain notions about life, passion and purposes. It's like, may be you want to be something for the sake of your passion but that wasn't a purpose of your soul and so you had to look at your life in a new way. The screenplay for the same is highly appreciated because the way it links fictional world with real World is truly amazing.Soul is artistically fabulous as the creativity behind the subject is Marvellous. The production design and visuals are eye-pleasing. It may not be groundbreaking but enough to prove it's creavity considering the need of the storyline. Pixar always gambles with similar theories where they connect emotions of the real life to the fictional fantasy world which doesn't exist but you easily believe in that unknown World. And the best part is, that fictional World teaches you a lot about real Life. Soul has managed to balance the content very well despite its complexity. The structure feels bit intricate at the start but once it's get going there're no hurdles. Soul connects to all ages audience because the importance of this message is universal, ageless and timeless.In a nutshell, Soul is lovable lesson on life that no one can hate. Emotional binding of Soul is unbreakable hence it tugs a ring in heart. A person with heart surely leaves with tears in eyes and joy in heart, that's where Pixar wins it all. Pete Docter delivers another heart-touching Classic in Pixar's legacy and he makes sure you're gonna live every moment of it. Disney and Pixar invites you on a journey of a lifetime which you must not miss if you are willing to find the real meaning of your Soul. This one is swimmingly in the top 5 films of the year.RATING - 8/10*",1,0,1,1,0,0,1
Soul,"Soul is phenomenal, Pixar at its best with a simple yet powerful message whilst also being an extremely inventive, really funny and emotional adventure. Jaime Foxx and Tina Fey are both incredible. Rachel House and Richard Ayoade are both great, as is Graham Norton surprisingly. The animation is phenomenal and breathtaking and Pete Doctor's direction is superb. The music by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross is excellent.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1
Soul,"Jamie Foxx, Trent Reznor, Pixar, Jazz Words cannot simply express how I felt throughout the film. It was lighthearted and fun. I felt joy, sadness and excitement all at the same time watching this movie.",1,1,1,0,0,1,0
Soul,"I feel the Pixar formula should be wearing thin by now, and having seen the trailer for this film countless times before, I expected nothing more than another decent flick from them, nothing grand though. Soul has its ups and downs, some predictable moments aside though, this film is an emotional and truly touching masterpiece, and is truly another great film from Pixar- perhaps their best in a while. Jamie Foxx provides an excellent performance as our lead, and Tina Fey also provided a great supporting performance as 22. Graham Norton is also quite good, but doesn't get as much time to shine as the other two main cast members. I did find moments of this film predictable, but how it made me feel and why was anything but. Pixar is known for their ability to make an audience cry, and for the most part I have been pretty immune (Inside Out and Toy Story 4 aside), but never have I been so emotional watching their films as I was with Soul. I won't spoil anything, but it's a touching and absolutely breathtaking spiritual journey with goregous animation and all our grand performances. I wish the film found a better fate than Disney +, but there is no doubt, for Disney that this is yet another solid success for them, and one audiences will remember for a very long time.My Rating: 9.5/10",1,1,1,1,0,1,0
Soul,"Movie night with Iris/ Gertie.People are so desperate for new movie content, that i feel critical faculties are being compromised. This 5* lauded movie underwhelmed me. It's heart is in the right place, and is very funny. However, it's just far too similar to (the superior) Inside Out. I was much happier in the jazz New York. Pixar dialled this one in for me.",1,0,1,0,0,0,0
Soul,"I think I'm glad I had no idea what this was about before turning it on. I was in no way prepared for it or the ways it moved me. The people at Pixar are officially wizards, because I think, on paper, this movie is actually pretty generic. It doesn't break ground the same way that other Pixar films have in the past and yet I was still almost in tears by the end. There are so many layers to this, variations on what it could mean. It's the kind of film I'm excited to back to and visit again and again. The way it uses sound and music, the relationships that are formed, it makes the viewer laugh and feel all at once in a artful orchestra of emotions.Go, watch Soul. It's free on Disney+ but even if it wasn't, this is worth spending money on. Incredible movie. Keep it up Pixar.",1,0,1,1,1,0,0
Soul,"There are times during the first quarter when you may believe someone's spiked your drink with an hallucinogenic as Disney's innovative way of capturing our entrance and exit to the world is developed but, as you will find, this is a film to get you thinking and, more importantly, thinking about yourself - reflecting so to speak. Delivered with the usual Pixar excellence, if this doesn't make you realise that tomorrow is the first day of the rest of your life then rewind, pause and start again, because the message is universally important to all - and that includes you!!!",1,0,1,1,0,0,0
Soul,"Probably one of the most adult-oriented for Pixar. I didn't cry, but this film made me question things the most. Like, questioning my decisions. Everyone has a special purpose in life. Sometimes, you just have to be a part of the good things that go along with it. That is the most wonderful thing about SOUL, a movie that will make you feel happy. Beautiful story and message. Pixar never disappoints.",1,0,1,1,0,0,0

Soul,"As many have pointed out, this is probably the Pixar movie with the most universal message, which is sure to please most people. I thoroughly enjoyed it for everything Pixar is good at: fantastic animation, creative artistic choices, great voice acting, etc. but for some reason I never really feel waves or excitement or emotion as I usually do with Pixar movies. Maybe being more balanced and grounded is actually more in line with its more adult theme and message but to me it felt like something was missing. Still, I highly recommend it to anyone!",1,0,1,1,1,1,1
Tenet,"The Protagonist (John David Washington) is a CIA operative. He is captured during an operation in Ukraine. He is able to eat a cyanide pill. He wakes up and gets recruited to fight a new cold war. Someone in the future is using inverted entropy to affect events in the past. He and Neil (Robert Pattinson) start investigating zeroing in on former Russian oligarch, Andrei Sator (Kenneth Branagh), and his abused wife Kat (Elizabeth Debicki).Christopher Nolan obviously has a thing about time. Memento happens to be one of my favorite films of all time. He is attacking it with all of his filmmaking skills and it is an attack from the editing, the sound mix, the plot, to the structure of the movie. First thing I noticed is that Nolan is relentlessly pushing the pace with every bit of filmmaking. The sound mix is like a heartbeat driving the movie whenever it goes into action mode. The editing is crisp and head-snapping. This is his transport plane deliberately driven into a constructed fake building. He's driving the movie into a fake building and not letting the audience the time to ruminate about the logic of the premise.In the end, that's its biggest flaw. The premise is out there and it's hard to keep track of the plot after the turn. The first part is a movie of one thing after another. When it gets to Kat, it finally tries to establish a connection with the characters. The fun part is the backward action moves but the logic of this premise keeps bugging me. For example, why is he trying to shoot himself in the past? Thinking about it after the fact leaves one with more questions and questions about the questions. The good part is that the relentless great action makes it impossible to dislike. The backwards action is just fun and different. That's plenty good enough.",1,1,-1,1,1,0,1
Tenet,"""Tenet"" is the newest movie by British Oscar-nominated filmmaker Christopher Nolan, who is widely considered among the most defining and visionary film directors these days, also because he writes his own screenplays. He had his 50th birthday this year and as a gift for his fans, there is a new movie out and here we have it. It runs for 2.5 hours exactly pretty much and I must say sadly that this is among my least favorites from the Oscar-nominated director. I wonder if he will ever win one. Probably, but I can't see it happen for this film here. I also struggled a bit with his previous movie ""Dunkirk"" three years ago, but there I thought it was maybe partially because war films were never my favorite genre. But this one here, in the widest sense, has parallens with ""Inception"" and that is a film I really appreciated, more with each viewing, but then again, maybe I need to watch this one also once or twice in the future and maybe I will appreciate it more. I just cannot say I am motivated at all right now. This also has to do with the cast. Or at least with lead actor John David Washington, who is strangely enough not even close to being first credit here on imdb. I also felt that on his big breakthrough film by Spike Lee that almost had him nominated for an Oscar, he was not particularly good, so I still do not really see any lead actor potential in him. This movie here definitely did not change my mind. Then again, Nolan's films are almost always more about the magic of the story and the scientific aspect partially even, the other production values too, and not necessarily about really deep and meaningful characters. It is the case here again. Robert Pattinson is another good example. I definitely think he received a lot of unfair criticism for Twilight and he has been (unlike Lautner) in several good films in the last decade since these vampire films and given strong performances too. He is definitely an option for an Oscar nomination in the near future. But for this film here he felt almost completely wasted. I mean he had a lot of screen time, but barely any significance. The one who stood out a bit in terms of performances here was Kenneth Branagh showing us that he can play a Russian brute very well too. Talented actor and filmmaker without a doubt and his rough take on the role made his relationship with Debicki's character the most interesting component of the entire film perhaps. Debicki did what she had to do I would say, but she never really stood out either. Oh yes, Nolan regular Michael Caine, who is closing in on 90, gets his one scene as well again basically talking to the protagonist relatively early on just like it was the case with ""Inception"" too for him. No material to shine at all though. That's pretty much it with the cast. More familiar faces and names too for sure, but nobody really outstanding.As for the story, you are thrown right in the middle of it all with the concert hall scene. It is tense and brutal, but for me it was too fast and I would have preferred a little more introduction and explanation here. Let's be honest. If you did not know who the protagonist was, simply because JDW is kinda famous (like him or not), it would have felt even more pointless. The idea of the suicide pill being just a test is an interesting one though and also kinda makes sense that it was all staged because, let's be honest, the ""bad guys"" must be utter fools to let such a severely suffering prisoner give his pill to another one caught by them. Still, this was to me the first moment and inclusion that felt good. A lot of the story about travelling back in time, like literally physically back in time felt not depicted in a way where it convinced me. If we are gentle, we could say that Nolan's mind is still too great to make sense to general audiences, but if not, we could also say that his idea here was not good and interesting enough and more for the sake of being genius than actually being genius and that also a lot got lost in translation. I did like the really simple introduction scene to the concept though at the shooting range between the scientist and the protagonist. This was nice. But when they extended this concept to humans and a plot that is about saving the world, then it did not win me over unfortunately. Oh well, like I said, maybe I need to watch it again. Also the final moment between Washington's and Pattinson's characters where we find out they knew each other for a lot longer did not make much of an impact to me. At least not as much as I hoped because this beautiful friendship was supposed to be shown as one of the more emotional twists this film has to offer. I would say that judging from the absense of audible reactions from the crowd during my showing that most others were not really that impressed either. Or maybe I am being too harsh here and really need to rewatch to see if the one reviewer on the front page here is correct by saying that it feels like nothing special on the first viewing, but pretty great on rewatch. Still not motivated though and besides, I rarely tend to appreciate a movie more on television or a small screen than at a movie theater and I will definitely not go again as long as it is shown right now. The only reason that could kinda get me to would be Branagh's performance. Here Nolan proves again for me that he may not really be the best when it comes to truly emotional aspects away from action sequences. I am mostly talking about the talk referring to the female protagonist's son. Like when we hear from one character the world will be destroyed and then Debicki's character says something like that would mean her son dies too. A bit on the cringe side. I am kinda glad they did not elaborate more on a potential romance relationship between her and JDW's character because then things could have gotten really messy. The one scene with the talk about Branagh's antagonist character thinking they could have sex was enough already. Speaking of him, he also talks on one occasion about holes in the neck and what to fill them with. Okay, that was rough. And almost a bit of cult like from a Tarantino movie (where we indirectly could have seen it depicted on the screen even). I won't deny it. Rough, but entertaining. What you think about the terminal disease plot that got revealed later on and as a consequence about Branagh's character developing some kind of god complex is up to you. I thought it was right, but like I said, I believed almost everything about Branagh's character and performance here. It's okay if you think it was too much. The one thing I would not be okay with though is really people saying that this was a magnificent movie or (one of) Nolan's best. I thought it was too much on the underwhelming side for a positive recommendation even and I genuinely hope that the filmmaker can improve again with his upcoming projects. I mean he may have another 30 years in the industry and I refuse to believe that ""Tenet"" (spelled Tenet backwards too, definitely not a coincidence) and ""Dunkirk"" will be on the same level as everything he has coming up in the future or at least I don't want to believe. No need to challenge your audience this much, Chris, sometimes less is more. How about an animated movie for once?",0,0,0,1,0,0,1
Tenet,"The film opens with music critics gone bad.May contain plot spoilers as I understand the plot. John David Washington is recruited to save the world from Andrei (Kenneth Branagh ) a Russian oligarch. A secret city in Russia was destroyed and has bomb grade 241 laying about in standardized containers. However, the plot isn't that simple. There is a time travel thing going on. Things move backwards and forwards in time. Both have to happen as not to disturb the entropy. If the algorithm is altered, everything ends.

Tenet,"There are elements of Christopher Nolan's Tenet that has been inspired by other sources. 12 Monkeys, La Jetée, The Red Dwarf episode called Backwards, Steven Moffat's Doctor Who stories featuring River Song.Stripped of its gimmick of inverted time. It is basically John Le Carre's The Night Manager. Elizabeth Debicki appeared in the television adaptation and basically plays a similar character in Tenet.The Protagonist (John David Washington) teams up with sidekick Neil (Robert Pattinson) to stop Russian oligarch Sator (Kenneth Branagh) who has found a way to send a destructive weapon back from the future.In this temporal war, the Protagonist needs to get to Sator via his estranged wife Kat (Elizabeth Debicki.)The inverted backward effects are eye dazzlingly conveyed. Nolan once again goes for an expensive high concept James Bond type set pieces.However the various going ons in the story is confusing. Not helped by terms such as Time Inversion, Temporal Pincer movement. I found the trick is to follow the forward narrative of Neil and not be confused by the The Protagonist's stories.Tenet is an enjoyable funfair ride. However I also felt that it was something you would quickly forget as you do not want to spend a lot of time thinking about it. I have no doubts that I would watch it again at a later date.Due to Covid 19, the cinema I saw it at was almost empty and I watched it on a weekend.

Tenet,"Now this movie really begs of you to listen, to watch and to be there for the whole thing. You can get not just the just of it in one viewing, but you can understand it - although as the movie itself tells the protagonist, sometimes it is ok to just ""feel it"". And that is something you most certainly can do. Anyone can do that.One thing I would recommend (if you like the genre that is of course, because if you're not open to this mind bender, than you're wasting your time anyway), is to watch this on the biggest screen possible. The best way to watch this is apparently the BFI in London (IMAX). That is of August 2020 speaking, there are cinemas being build even during the pandemic, one in the south of Germany, which has as a goal to be the biggest screen worldwide. Now just check where an Imax is and if you can attend to a screening there. Otherwise just choose another screen, but try to watch it in cinemas. Hopefully you're not too afraid because of Corona and your cinemas are still open and do everything they can to be safe.Talking about safe. That is one of the goals of our main protagonist. Even if he doesn't know it yet - or maybe he does? Is it complex? For sure and that's a good thing. While driving to the cinema (Imax) we watched this at (with a couple of friends), we got into traffic and were a bit late. So we did miss the first couple of minutes and were told of them. Not just because of that I will watch it again. And yet I still got it. I would even say that if you've seen the odd movie here and there, you will be able to know certain things (""twists"" or revelations).I can not stress out enough how visually amazing this is, but we knew that of Christopher Nolan. The sound design is amazing too, soundtrack heightens everything - and the acting is top notch. Now one of the points I felt was not done very well, was the ""sailing"" scene. You almost couldn't understand them at all. Most of the other stuff wasn't that bad. But again and as said before twice: you've got to feel it - so do you feel it?",1,0,1,1,1,1,1
Tenet,"This film was originally intended to be released in mid-July 2020, but was delayed to 31 July, until finally being released in August, this is due to the COVID-19 pandemic causing all cinemas to close during the lockdown. I saw the five minute footage trailer back in March, and I was most interested to see it on the big screen, so thank goodness cinemas eventually reopened (with guidelines and safety measures), and I went to see this. The dictionary definition of ""tenet"" is ""any opinion, principle, doctrine, dogma, etc., especially one held as true by members of a profession, group, or movement"", I just knew it was a blockbuster that loads of people, including me, were keen to see, written and directed by Christopher Nolan (Memento, Insomnia, The Dark Knight, Inception, Dunkirk). Basically, an unnamed Protagonist (John David Washington, Denzel's son), a CIA agent posing as a Ukrainian policeman, participates in an undercover Russian operation to steal an unidentified object during a terrorist siege on an opera house in Kyiv. During the chaos, the Protagonist is saved by a masked gunman using time-reversing technology. The Russians turn on the CIA members and torture the Protagonist, but he bites a suicide pill before to avoid revealing any information. The Protagonist wakes, learning that the pill was fake, and that all his team members were caught and killed by the Russians, and they have got the unidentified object. The Protagonist is recruited into a secret organisation seeking to track down the origin of ""inverted"" objects, which move backward through time, using future technology sent back into the past. Investigating inverted bullets, the Protagonist is assisted by Neil (Robert Pattinson) to infiltrate the compound of an arms dealer, Priya (Dimple Kapadia). She directs them towards Russian oligarch Andrei Sator (Kenneth Branagh). To reach Sator, the Protagonist approaches Sator's wife Kat (Elizabeth Debicki). The Protagonist experiences the inverted technology during an operation, involving a plane crashed the storage facility in Oslo Airport, where he fights a regular masked man. Neil unmasks and releases his opponent, then stops the Protagonist from killing the inverted opponent, who escapes. Priya explains that the facility contained a time inversion device. Kat arranges for the Protagonist to meet Sator, who the Protagonist saves Sator from Kat's murder attempt. Sator reveals that information sent from the future had contributed to his wealth. The Protagonist offers to steal the object that Sator had been seeking, in exchange that Kat will be freed. After the Protagonist and Neil steal the object from an armoured car in transport, an inverted Sator confronts them, holding Kat hostage to obtain the object. Neil calls in the secret organisation's time-inverting troops to assist. Time inversion devices are used by Sator and the Protagonist and they battle for possession of the object, with Sator ultimately prevailing; and Kat is severely wounded with an inverted bullet. To save Kat from death, the Protagonist and Neil join her in inverted time, but they require the device in Oslo Airport to un-invert in the past. They infiltrate the airport, using the plane crash as a distraction: the masked man the Protagonist previously encountered was actually his future self. The un-inversion is successful. Priya explains that the crucial object is part of a future-developed ""algorithm"" capable of catastrophically inverting the entire world. The algorithm was sent into the past to prevent its use in the future, leading to human extinction from climate change. Kat reveals Sator's motive: he is dying from inoperable cancer and believes that the world should die with him. Sator has the algorithm and travels to a time in the past when he was most happy, where he plans to die peacefully and activate the algorithm. He is followed by Kat and the time-inverting secret organisation. Kat will delay Sator's death in Vietnam, while troops attack a Soviet closed city to retrieve the algorithm. Kat kills Sator prematurely, but the Protagonist and Neil retrieve the algorithm in time. During the retrieval, the Protagonist is saved by a masked corpse who springs back to life inverted. The organisation plans to separately hide the algorithm's components. As Neil and the Protagonist part ways, Neil reminisces about their long partnership, revealing that the future version of the Protagonist had recruited Neil in Neil's past. The Protagonist notices that Neil has a red string on his backpack, like that who saved him in the opera house. Neil insists he must continue his mission, intending to invert time. In London, Priya attempts to kill Kat to tie up loose ends. Instead, the Protagonist kills Priya, and implies that a future version of himself will be the mastermind behind all of the secret organisation's actions. Also starring Aaron Taylor-Johnson as Ives, Himesh Patel as Mahir, Michael Caine as Michael Crosby, and Fiona Dourif (Brad's daughter) as Wheeler. Washington is reasonable as the lead, Pattinson is fine, Branagh is suitably hammy as the villain, and there is almost point in Caine being in the film, being in a single and very short scene. A character asks, ""Does your head hurt yet?"" to another, that is exactly the feeling you are going have watching this film. You cannot deny that the special effects, editing, and sound design are fantastic to make spectacular scenes with explosions, gunfire and crashes seen reversing and going forward, sometimes in the same scene. The problem is, it is pretty much impossible to try and work out what the hell is going on, it is trying to be too clever that it almost forgets about the audience watching. It's not quite what I had in mind as the first film to watch returning to the cinema, lol.

Tenet,"A CIA agent is given an unusual assignment: track down the source of inverted bullets, bullets that move backwards through time. This will hopefully lead him to the source of entropy-reversal technology from the future.Christopher Nolan is one of my favourite directors, with Memento ranking, for me, as the second greatest movie of all time. Being written and directed by him you know it is going to be clever and complex.Here, however, he lays on the complexity but fails to make it entirely understandable. Twists and cleverness just for twists and cleverness sake. Throw in the fact that the dialogue often gets drowned out by the loud, droning, this-is-a-key-moment-so-needs-loud-music score (a trick Nolan picked up in Dunkirk, where we had that irritating droning sound throughout the movie) and the plot is difficult to follow. At a point I gave up trying to understand the concepts behind the plot, or follow the plot itself, and just went along for the ride.In addition to being not entirely comprehensible, the film is more an action movie than an intelligent thriller. It has many traits of a Bond film: jet-setting locations, find A to get to B to get to C with the slimmest links between the different parts in the chain. This all an excuse for some outlandish scheme or action sequence. Plus the villain has the opportunity to quickly kill the hero several times but chooses not too - very Bond-like. Add in the perfectly-choreographed action sequences, many big, bright explosions and it's more style than substance.This said, it is reasonably enjoyable. The action sequences are well done, it moves at a great pace and doesn't feel like a 2.5-hour movie.Performances are pretty solid, especially from John David Washington (in the lead role) and Elizabeth Debicki. Kenneth Branagh does his best fake Russian accent and seems every inch the Bond villain. I have never liked Robert Pattinson, thanks to that Twilight crap, but was hoping here he could prove he had some decent dramatic acting skills. Sadly, no, he doesn't.More style than substance, and below Christopher Nolan's usual standard, but reasonably entertaining.",0,1,-1,0,-1,1,1
Tenet,"The protagonist(John David Washington, a great lead) is recruited to stop a major threat. I won't reveal more detail than that. Thankfully, he won't have to face it alone. He'll be working with Neil(Robert Pattinson, all charm and wit). Hypothetically, if he had other allies, I would not give away here who they are. I won't reveal the exact nature of the role of Kat(Elizabeth Debicki, somehow matching her work in Widows. Covering a lot of the emotional spectrum). But I will say that, if I didn't love everything about this(don't get me wrong, I absolutely do), honestly, even if, in fact, I *hated* every single other thing about this movie, it would still be worth watching for her performance and presence alone. They are up against a formidable threat: Sator(Kenneth Branagh, very sinister). Can they possibly save the world?The director continues to master spy movies. In some ways this is James Bond with a mindbending sci-fi twist. Nolan has returned to the heights of quality of The Prestige, The Dark Knight and Inception. It has the best and biggest action set pieces of his career, and it's the most visually compelling. Even for him, this is incredibly complex. It won't be enough to pay close attention and try carefully to figure everything out while watching. You'll have to go over everything afterwards. It may take multiple viewings. I won't claim I understand everything in this yet.This pushes the PG-13 rating, and contains a lot of exploration of abuse, some deeply disturbing violence(even though it is more hinted at than clearly shown), and a little bit of strong language. I recommend this to every fan of anyone working on this, with the obvious caveat that I would not want for anyone who fears for their safety in a theatre due to Covid to risk harm to themselves or those around them. 10/10",1,1,0,1,0,1,1
Tenet,"Following a muddlesome terrorist attack on an opera, this unnamed chap (who I shall call Z) is introduced to the phenomenon of inversion. Inversion is the reversal of entropy, and can be applied to an object, a location, one or more individuals etc. This means that time can run forwards and backwards at more or less the same time in more or less the same place. It is dangerous: if overused it can overbalance entropy, which will end everything. And a nasty Russian piece of work is trying to collect bits of a mechanism so that he can activate an algorithm...Christopher Nolan's latest follows Inception and interstellar and, if you thought they were difficult to understand and follow, you ain't seen nothin' yet.Inversion is a great maguffin. The problem here is that in order to follow the story, you need to have an understanding of how inversion works, and that's exactly what you don't get here. In fact a lady scientist early on says ""Don't try to understand it, just accept it,"" and this is effectively writer/director talking to the viewer. I think this is code for him saying ""I haven't really thought this through completely, so don't expect it to make sense."" Given that it has taken him years to write this...There are various problems. Given that you have time running backwards and forwards at the same time, it's fair to generate an element of ""What's going on?"" to be answered when a reverse-time sequence unfolds in positive time back to its start at the end. But what I just said gives some indication of how preplexing the film is when much of it is told that way. A number of IMDB reviews say it was gibberish on first viewing, made sense on second viewing. My opinion is that you shouldn't have to see a film twice for it to make sense, especially if it takes a frustrating two and a half hours to watch it once.The next problem is that dialogue is mumbled and buried under general noise, making it nearly impossible to hear very necessary exposition.I'm not going to go on about this film which would have been a great deal better if it had been a great deal simpler, and which would have benefitted from Nolan having a co-writer on board to act as the viewer's friend. This film is NOT the greatest thing since sliced bread. I give it 5 out of 10, which is what happens when a 10/10 positive entropy maguffin meets an inversed 0/10 script.",-1,-999,-1,0,-1,-999,0
Tenet,"Seeing Tenet finally being released in the UK,I looked up details of it being shown in IMAX, (well aware of the film makers love for the format) and was thrilled to find that half the movie was in that format. A fan of the director, I booked a ticket at the Manchester IMAX Vue in The Printworks, (the second biggest screen in Europe) and got set to turn back time.View on the film:Later revealing that he based his take on the character on author Christopher Hitchens, (most noticeable in his mannerism and accent)Robert Pattinson gives a exuberant performance as Neil, whose fight to straighten time out is charged by a slippery confidence of Neil not revealing all his cards to the audience.Picking up the mission file from Sir Michael, John David Washington gives a brooding turn as ""The Protagonist"", giving the action scenes a real grit by fighting tooth and nail,along with a intense urgency to turn the clocks.Igniting his experimentation of compressed sound with gunfire landing to Ludwig Goransson's thrashing score, and not containing any green screen shots, writer/directing auteur Christopher Nolan reunites with cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema, and continues to explore the manipulation of time in film he first clicked in Memento (2000) in a spectacular fashion.Nolan and Hoytema turn the clocks with mesmerising in-camera tricks panning the camera over alterations in time,rising to long crane shots gliding across vast action set-pieces running under a powder keg
timer. Keeping up close to Neil & The Protagonist ,Nolan hits a winning punch with a ground and pound mood unleashed in narrow corridor tracking shots striking a immerse atmosphere from the camera winding backwards to Neil and The Protagonist's fight to stop the final countdown.",1,1,0,1,0,1,1
Tenet,"I had to watch this movie twice to even partially digest it. The last time I had to do that was for a movie called ""Primer"" which was a super complex temporal movie. Whenever you get deep into time travel and temporal loops you open up a can of WTF that can't be closed again.I'm not going to delve deeply into the plot of ""Tenet"" because I'll only confuse you and myself. Suffice it to say that Protagonist (John David Washington) was on a mission. The mission had to do with a doomsday device that involved time collapsing on itself (kind of). In this future there were items that could be inverted; meaning that their movements were backwards (bullets going back into guns). Their ""entropy"" was reversed. There are also ""turnstiles"" that people can go through and ""invert"" themselves. And that's when it gets really head-scratching.Protagonist is helped along the way by Neil (Robert Pattinson) and reluctantly by Katherine ""Kat"" Barnes (Elizabeth Debicki). They help Protagonist get close to Andrei Sator (Kenneth Branagh), our antagonist who happens to know very well how to use the turnstiles for his benefit.""Tenet"" was a combination of ""Looper,"" ""The Edge of Tomorrow,"" and many other temporal loop movies with a splash of ""Inception"" level brain melting. I have to say that even though I was struggling to process it all while watching I was still very much into it. If you're going to go over peoples' heads, at least do it extravagantly, and that's what Christopher Nolan did. The movie was good enough with my tenuous grasp that it warranted me watching a second time (I did buy it after all).John David Washington isn't terribly convincing as an action hero or a suave spy. His father did a better job at an advanced age in the movie ""The Equalizer."" The fight sequences were a little lacking as was his acting. Pattinson, on the other hand, was a bit more convincing.The dialog of the movie from all parties was a little confusing. The accents presented some problems with understanding, but more than that it seemed that the script was intentionally vague even when it didn't need to be. I get that the entire concept is bananas and creates a paradox like you wouldn't believe, but there are times when more words could've helped while not frying our brains.In the end I liked it. It made me think, it made me pay attention, shoot, it made me take notes. I only regret that COVID prevented me from seeing this in the theater.",1,0,-1,0,-999,1,0
Tenet,"Finally after months back to the cinema and going in blind in this hyped flick I just didn't know what it was all about. And once it was over my daughter looked at me and I looked back both saying, did you understood it all.That said it must say a lot about this flick. In the beginning it's all understandable espescially the beginning but after the main titles this get explained and if you blink your eyes too much you will never understand it all.Still, we agreed that it will need a second watch to get it but the effects used are stunning. Story is also way above mediocre as did the acting.The last half hour the grand finally it's a bit easier to get it with the coloured scarves but still. It's not one to watch if you need a no-brainer.Together with it's score it elevates this one to a flick well noticed for Oscar nomination, read my lips and no, I didn't did any time travelling

Tenet,"I have seen this film twice now - once on an IMAX and once on a smaller screen to try and get the most from it - and I have to admit it's just nothing special. John David Washington - manscaped to within an inch of his life - is the ""Protagonist"" - a man who can manipulate time and who is recruited to work with ""Neil"" (Robert Pattinson) to track down a device that could destroy the world. His task is made much the harder because the future seems to be the source of much of the danger as he tries to track down and thwart Russian oligarch ""Andrei Sator"" (Sir Kenneth Branagh). Aside from plenty of action and some really clever special effects, that's about the height of it. JDW is adequate in the lead, but Pattinson is about as convincing as a rubber spider and Sir Kenneth's accent is so thick as to remind me of Cate Blanchett's dodgy wubble-ewes from ""Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" (2008). The star, for me at any rate, is Elizabeth Debicki as the trophy-wife who has an agenda of her own to escape the clutches of her megalomaniac husband, with her son - and so becomes an obvious ally on their quest. The plot is oddly straightforward, it's pretty obvious from the outset whom he can/cannot trust and once the faux-complexities of the story have been laid bare, the rest of the film is just a pretty routine spy drama that looks great - car chases, glamorous scenery etc - but is surely just a superb acclamation of hype over content. Certainly worth watching - and I'd say more than once, but it is by no means the best work from this visionary director .",1,1,-1,0,0,1,1
Tenet,"First of all, did I enjoy this movie from Christopher Nolan? Was I entertained for the entire duration which was quite long? On both questions I have to answer yes. Now I don't concider myself as dumb, but I'm not a genius either, but this movie is so hard to follow, almost at the point you pain your brain trying to figure out what's going on. I'm happy I'm not the only one that didn't understand much of the complexity of the story. Like some other reviewers stated it's probably better to watch it a second time to fully, or at least partially understand, but I'm not going to do that. Tenet is just one of those movies that need your full constant attention, very difficult to understand but that isn't bad for the matter. The cinematography is great, with excellent action scenes, and a cast that did a very good job. John David Washington and Robert Pattinson, the two main characters are pleasant to watch. In conclusion, I'm surprised I liked this movie as I didn't get it all, but I'm not sure it will please everybody, certainly not the picky viewers.",1,1,-1,1,0,1,1
Tenet,"""Don't try to understand it, feel it.""Advice from a scientist in Tenet works well as you watch this sci-fi thriller from the acclaimed Christopher Nolan, who never could pass up a genre for his own take. His newest film is closer to his Inception and Memento, but for an intellectual romp, this time ""time travel"" is the fully operative motif.It's not helpful to have seen Back to the Future or Hot Tub Time Machine, for Tenet takes itself half seriously (e.g. the title is a palindromic bon-bon) as it explores the effect of the future on the present, or is it the other way around? See, even I'm confused while I still enjoyed Nolan's filmmaking chops so evident in cinematography and action set pieces.Nolan wants to play with the spy motif, and he succeeds. The Protagonist (John David Washington), as he is called in an unusually heavy-handed allegorical trope, is a secret agent type trying to stop WWIII. He has a Bondian deliciously bad oligarch, Andrei Sator (Kenneth Branagh), as his arch enemy and a sweet, albeit tall, femme in Kat (Elizabeth Debicki). Add world destruction as Sator's goal, and you have a template for Bond, Bourne, Kirk, and myriad other time and space traveling operatives.
The difference is that Nolan emphasizes the physics and philosophies of the conjunction of past with present as opposed to superficial gloss, although it has some mighty fetching eye candy at that. But the emphasis here is on the morality of messing with time and the temporal challenges with humans who must navigate it while entwined in love and hate and all that jazz.I'm not sure I can right now make this mind-bending adventure more thematically cogent. I do know that watching it in an AMC Dolby theater is a sensual joy while it is a brainy challenge of movie making at its most amusing and provocative.""All I have for you is a word: Tenet. It'll open the right doors, some of the wrong ones too."" Victor (Martin Donovan)",0,1,0,0,-999,0,1
Tenet,"It's like Nolan is upset that some people understood what he was trying to do, so he makes things more and more complex until he is sure no one does understand. This film is about a very skilled and motivated special agent - think James Bond on steroids - who gets recruited to fight in a temporal war. The technology has been created to reverse the flow of entropy, which means objects and people can be made to travel backwards in time, and by that I mean literally just do things in reverse, not teleport in time, while the rest of the world goes in the normal direction. It's an intriguing concept that generates a storyline so complex that it can't be understood from just a viewing.So the question is: is this movie good enough to warrant multiple viewings, so that people can grasp the intricacies of time travel and of Nolan's twisted mind? And for me the answer is no. I have no idea where are the logic holes in the plot and frankly I don't care, and that for a very simple reason: I couldn't relate to any character, except perhaps Robert Pattinson's. The special agent that fights for the world, who has no history or personal life, a ""protagonist"" bought wholesale from a shelf, is boring as a person and as a character. The amazingly beautiful woman who is the object of interest for both hero and villain, for no good reason other than she's hot, whose motivation is solely related to her son and her own selfish emotions, to the point where she risks the existence of the world on ""not letting him feel he won"", is almost as disgusting if not more as the villain. Everyone else is just a pawn, acting as such, with a few scenes each in Nolan's extensive plot.Another issue with the film is the pace. Having worked so much on the plot, I guess it was a chore to compress it all to the size of a film. And even so it was two ours and a half long. This would have been much better served by a miniseries. As such, it felt rushed with details that you had to think through while other fast paced scenes were flooding in.It was a very carefully crafted film, which makes it well above average, but it failed at the basics: characterization and pace. Perhaps I will think about it some more and manage to enjoy the genius in it, but after just having watched it, I just feel tired and glad it's over.",-1,-1,-1,-1,-999,-1,-999
Tenet,"< That said, no one expects Nolan's film would be a fertile playground for first-grade acting chops (the late Heather Ledger is a flash in the pan), but even the pageantry here does not cut it for Nolan's standard, the mocked final battlefield sequences are too frantically edited that one can not discern which team is ""red"" and which is ""blue"", not to mention to trace the whole shebang of the so-called ""temporal pincer movement"" into which so many pains and efforts are poured. >read full review on my blog: cinema omnivore, thanks",-1,-999,0,0,-999,-999,-1
Tenet,"It's crazy that it's been several months since I checked this film out in theaters (one of the few times I visited the cinema during the pandemic) and thought that this may signal the return for theaters overall. Of course, we know that wasn't the case, but I'm still not quite sure why I never reviewed Tenet back in August. Perhaps I was hoping to see it for a second time to help wrap my head around my feelings after the first viewing.I still to this day don't know how I feel about this film. I think it's still one of Nolan's weakest films (which to the normal director would be a massive compliment) but I was truly hoping for something spectacular here. To a certain extent, Nolan does give an incredible effort to reinventing certain aspects of filmmaking but was it truly enough? Will the mainstream audience think this film is too ""inside baseball"", yeah maybe. And even for a film nut like me, it is very dense and at times difficult to comprehend. But I would much rather be challenged than see the same old action film over and over again.With all that being said, it's hard not to hope Nolan goes in a new direction for his next idea. I'm not sure if it's adapting a book or someone else's original script (like he has done a few times) or just taking his scale smaller (like with The Prestige) but I'm still looking forward to whatever it is he does next. Here's to the future of filmmaking!8.2/10",1,0,-1,-1,-999,0,1
Tenet,"There's been a great deal of talk about the impenetrability of the plot of Christopher Nolan's latest blockbuster ""Tenet"" when, in fact, the plot isn't so much inpenetrable, (the 'plot' itself, for want of a better word, is actually quite simple and is spelled out in the first fifteen minutes or so), as sci-fi silly. This is another time travel picture but instead of time travel it's called 'inversion' which is really time travel by the back door so that about midway through the forward thrust of the plot takes a back seat and we start going back in time or maybe 'back to the future'; at least I think that was what was happening. To be honest, by now I didn't really care. I had long stopped trying to 'follow' the movie and was now just sitting back and enjoying every daft minute of it.Of course, it's not the first time Nolan has mucked about with 'inversion' or just played havoc with our perceptions of reality. ""Momento"" told its story backwards while I'm still puzzling over ""Inception"". This, you may argue, is cleverness for its own sake but I'm sure Nolan doesn't expect anyone to take a calculus or a set of algorithms into the cinema. He knows this is nonsense and he's just messing with us and messing with us on a supersonic level. First and last ""Tenet"", (oh, and the title's a palindrome, geddit?), is just a big, dumb-but-prentending-to-be-clever action flic with some of the most terrific set-pieces in years, (an 'inverted' car chase sets a new high). It's also got a deliberately cheesy script and some bravura tonge-in-cheek performances.If John David Washington is a little too insouciant as the hero, (or the protagonist as he keeps referring to himself), he's ably backed up by a superb Robert Pattinson as his sidekick, a terrific Kenneth Branagh relishing his role as the villain to end all villains, (please cast him in the next Bond movie), and a spunky Elizabeth Debicki as a time-travelling wife, mother and potential love interest. You don't expect performances of this quality in nonsense of this kind so let's just say they are a bonus. The final bonkers, saving the world from total destruction climax is over-extended and the movie tidies itself up a little too smugly but I'll forgive these minor blemishes when everything else is so much fun.",-1,1,1,-1,0,1,1
Tenet,"It is one thing for a film to have a complex narrative structure and another for it to be a convoluted mess. And Tenet is unfortunately the latter. A high-concept, sci-fi mind-bender with a premise that packed just the right kind of intrigue, potential & promise, it really is a shame that the execution is so incoherent & all over the place that even after one connects all the dots, there is no rewarding feeling or sense of gratification waiting in the end.Written & directed by Christopher Nolan, once again he comes up with an original & seemingly ingenious idea but fails to construct an emotionally fulfilling plot around it. Though his attempt to dismantle & reassemble the same series of events to provide added context & new perspective is admirable, the plot still lacks the smooth flow & cohesiveness that can not only elevate & enrich a cinematic experience like this but also make the journey thoroughly satisfying & worthwhile.The sci-fi mechanics at play here are interesting to say the least but the characters remain cold & distant throughout the film, their persona & interplay lacking depth & connection to such an extent that not even the film's end-of-the-world shtick is able to make us care. The inversion segments sure look cool & disorienting but they still don't make up for the glaring problems in the screenplay. And then, things get even worse when some of the technical aspects are taken into consideration.Performances from the cast is good but there are no standouts. Robert Pattinson is the only one who tries to make his role count while others just play along as per the scene requirements with surface-level emotions. Editing is a mixed bag, captivating & confusing in equal measure, and is unable to make all elements work together in harmony. Ludwig Göransson's score has no idea how to keep up with the unfolding set of events. Messy & muddled, it neither exhibits a structural flow nor any sensory thrills.Overall, Tenet is an audacious effort by all means but it also falls short of living up to its own lofty ambitions and is an inconsistent ride that's marred by issues of its own makings. Nolan finally bites off more than he can chew, making Tenet one of his least impressive entries. Still, for what it's worth, this cerebral delight piqued my curiosity enough to warrant another viewing. But as per first impressions, Christopher Nolan's latest is a disjointed & disappointing mess that effectively showcases his best & worst tendencies as a filmmaker.",-1,1,-1,-1,0,1,-1

Basically it is an ensemble cast delving into nine (or ten) separate stories involving a variety of characters and their experiences of love, falling in and out and trying to find love, all played out over the week fives, leading up to Christmas. Rock and roll legend Billy Mack (BAFTA winning Bill Nighy) has recorded ""Christmas Is All Around"", a variation of ""Love Is All Around"", he and his longtime manager Joe (Rab C. Nesbitt's Gregor Fisher) know the song is terrible, but are promoting it as much as possible in hope that it will become Christmas Number One, they are successful, but Billy leaves a party with Sir Elton John to spend time with Joe to celebrate getting drunk and watching porn.

Writer Jamie (Colin Firth) is devastated after finding out his girlfriend (Sienna Guillory) has been cheating on him with his brother, Jamie retreats to his French cottage to continue writing, there Protugese housekeeper Aurélia (Lúcia Moniz) helps him, she can only speak her native language, but they form a close bond, Jamie realises after she leaves he has developed feelings for Aurélia, so he learns (roughly) Portugese, returns to France, finds her, declares his love and proposes, in English, she accepts and they kiss. Harry (Alan Rickman) is the managing director of a design agency, he is married to Karen (BAFTA nominated Emma Thompson) with two children, Harry is attracted to new secretary Mia (Resident Evil's Heike Makatsch) who makes arousing sexual comments, while shopping he attempts to buy her a necklace, but is slowed down by obsessive attention to detail gift-wrapping salesman Rufus (Rowan Atkinson) and stops himself getting caught by Karen, however she finds out about the necklace, after he did buy it, but is heartbroken when she does not receive it, she confronts Harry, he apologises for being a fool, she knows their marriage will not be the same.

Sarah (Laura Linney) who works at Harry's graphic design company has been in love with creative director Karl (Rodrigo Santoro) for years, they finally get together, but are interrupted by her mentally ill brother Michael (Michael Fitzgerald), who constantly phones from his residence in a mental care facility, Karl tries to say something on Christmas Eve, but cannot, so Sarah spends the night with her brother. Colin (My Family's Kris Marshall) has made many failed attempts to woo British girls, including Mia and wedding caterer Nancy (Julia Davis), he tells his friend Tony (Abdul Salis) he is going to America to find love there, convinced foreign girls love British men, Tony thinks it is a stupid idea, but once in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Colin meets three stunningly attractive women, Stacey (Ivana Miličević), Jeannie (American Pie: The Wedding's January Jones) and Carol-Anne (The Girl Next Door's Elisha Cuthbert), who invite him to their house, and roommate Harriet (Shannon Elizabeth) joins also.

Love Actually,"This romantic comedy follows several interconnected couples in the five weeks running up to Christmas; each is very different and not all are romantic love. We have the newly elected prime minister finding love with a member of his staff; his sister whose marriage could be in danger when another woman catches the eye of her husband; a widower whose young son has fallen in love with a girl in his class; a writer who falls for his Portuguese maid despite the fact that they can't understand each other; a single man who believes that if he goes to America women will throw themselves at him; a couple of porn actors; a man who loves his best friend's new wife and a few others besides.Over the course of the film we move between the characters, dipping in and out of their lives as their relationships develop or don't. Don't expect realism; this is after all a comedy not a study of real relationships or situations. It is however a lot of fun and will probably leave most viewers grinning from ear to ear thanks to the feel-good stories; even if they seem to include every cliché possible! The cast includes a wide array of British acting talent including rom-com regulars Hugh Grant and Colin Firth. They all put in fine performances although some inevitably stand out; Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson were great as a couple whose marriage might be about to go through a rough patch and Bill Nighy was hilarious as the aging rocker who has recorded a Christmas single; he knows it is awful and is happy to tell everybody.

And they don't come much more fluffy and saccharine sweet than Love Actually (which I'm squeezing in between a Dario Argento giallo and a trashy Pete Walker slasher).Director Richard Curtis delivers a series of cleverly written tales about the trials and tribulations of love, covering the many facets of the subject: unrequited love, platonic love, adulterous love, young love, spontaneous love, dangerous love. Always chuckle-some, occasionally laugh-out-loud funny, but never boring, Curtis's sparkling script brings us a collection of likable characters who are brilliantly brought to life by an amazing ensemble cast, which includes Hugh Grant, Emma Thompson, Colin Firth, Keira Knightley, Bill Nighy, Alan Rickman, Martine McCutcheon, Rowan Atkinson, Liam Neeson, and Billy Bob Thornton, plus brief cameos from, amongst others, Michael Parkinson, Ant and Dec, Elisha Cuthbert, Claudia Schiffer, Shannon Elizabeth and Denise Richards.Nighy, in particular, shines as a has-been rocker vying for the Xmas No.1 spot, giving a bittersweet take on the whole romance schtick, as does Laura Linney who plays Sarah, a woman whose love for her brother costs her the chance of scoring with her dream man. On the more traditionally 'sappy' side of things, Grant's Prime Minister falling for working class cutie McCutcheon borders on fantasy, but is perfect viewing fodder for couples curled up in each other's arms on the couch.Now, if you'll excuse me, I think I'll get back to the wanton slaughter of buxom women before I find myself hooked on rom-coms!",1,1,1,1,0,1,0
Love Actually,"EDIT: November 2018, my wife and I watched it again after 14 years and while it was all ""familiar"" once we got into each scene it also was fresh again. We really enjoyed it again.This is one of the most delightful romantic comedies I have seen in quite a while. It is 4 weeks before Christmas in London, Hugh Grant is the newly-elected and single Prime Minister. There are several couples very loosely connected and this 2-hour movie which follows the development of each attempt at romance. Grant begins the movie with a voice-over, and showing various anonymous people in public showing affection for each other. And the movie ends the same way.

A great ensemble cast and fine British humor in the vein of 'Notting Hill' and 'Four Weddings'. Nudity and blue language make it for the over-21 crowd.
SPOILERS follow, for my recollection only, please read no further -- One of the 'couples' was Colin Firth, a writer, and his Portugese housekeeper. He spoke no Portugese, she no English. With subtitles, we see that often they are saying the same thing without knowing it. Near the end he looks her up at her waitress job back home, he has learned Portugese, and she has learned a little English. He proposes, she accepts. A scene set up very well.Another humorous scene was Billy Bob Thornton as the USA President (POTUS) visiting Grant. POTUS has an eye for Natalie, the cute assistant of the Prime Minister, and as soon as he gets her alone, he makes a move for her. Obviously a spoof of a real POTUS, from Arkansas. The assistant gets moved to a different job, but she sends Grant a nice Christmas card, he looks her up, they end up together.There is a side story of a washed-up musician making a Christmas record, which becomes number one, and leaves a party on Christmas eve to return to his chubby manager, telling him 'you're the one I really loved all these years.' Then the funny story of the Brit who can't ever score with women, decides to go to America to pick up chicks, his friend laughs at him, he goes to Milwaukee, goes into the nearest bar, orders a Budweiser, is soon surrounded by three gorgeous girls, and he eventually brings two sisters back with him to the UK.Another story is the 10-year-old boy who has a crush on a cute singer at school, and eludes guards at the airport to tell her goodbye before she leaves for the States. Another are the two movie stand-ins who have to do semi-nude scenes for blocking, they eventually end up together.",1,1,0,0,0,1,0
Love Actually,"Richard Curtis, from my perspective, deserves both panning and praise for his first film as a writer/director, Love Actually- it's loaded to the brim with nearly every kind of relationship/romance/infidelity convention you can think of, wedged into eight different couples intertwined together in merry old England. However, having said that, I can't say I didn't have a bad time during Love Actually, and I didn't feel compelled to walk out or leave to go to the bathroom for a long stretch of time either. What works about the movie are two things- the characters Curtis sets up and unfolds, to one degree or another in this definitely movie-movie universe, are believable, and surprisingly there is some interestingly dramatic elements thrown in here and there (particularly with Laura Linney, Liam Neeson- early on, and Emma Thompson). The other thing is the cast, which includes the known likes of Linney, Neeson, Thompson, Alan Rickman, Hugh Grant, Colin Firth, and some charming work thrown in by lessor known actors like Kiera Knightly (who got a break during the summer with Curse of the Black Pearl), Martine McCutcheon, Lucia Moniz, Rodrigo Santoro, Thomas Sangster as the boy in love, and nice little cameos for Rowan Atkinson, Billy Bob Thornton, Shannon Elizabeth, etc. The drawback to some of the performances and stories is that since the story jumps from one place to another, and since we can predict more or less where each character's destiny lies on Christmas Eve, there is maybe a little too much emphasis on the paths instead of a little more depth (outside of the dramatic input of course). Plus, you can tell the film was not the kind of film released first in America and sold later to Europe. Yet, like I said, the flaws may be moot to most movie-goers, because Curtis is just out to get the audience into having a good, escapist experience with these people, and the main and supporting players do what they can. Also, as some other reviewers and commentators have noted, the show stopper is indeed Bill Nighy as Billy Mack, the aging, cynical rock star recording and selling a Christmas single on TV and Radio as the sort of background in the film. Along with being the funniest character of the lot, he ends up garnering some heartedness too by the climax. I wouldn't bother seeing it again for a while, but I was glad I saw it in a packed audience-type of atmosphere. Grade: (strong) B",0,1,0,1,-999,1,-999
Love Actually,"Hugh Grant, Liam Neeson, Alan Rickman, Emma Thompson, Laura Linney and Colin Firth all experience ""Love Actually,"" a shortened form of a phrase, ""love actually is all around,"" as stated by Hugh Grant in the opening narration. This 2003 film, well directed by Richard Curtis, isn't a typical romantic comedy. It concerns all kinds of love...and while love actually is all around, sometimes things don't work out as we hoped.As you might guess from the formidable list of stars, the film is somewhat episodic. Liam Neeson plays a man who has just lost his wife and now has to deal with his withdrawn son; Laura Linney is an assistant in love with her boss, but personal problems get in the way; Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson are a long married couple, and now he finds himself being seduced by an office tramp; Hugh Grant is the new prime minister who falls for someone on his staff...etc. There are some adorable stories: Neeson and his son plotting to get a goddess to notice the boy at school...hilarious stories: Bill Nighy as a washed up singer who promotes one of his old songs that has been changed with Christmas lyrics; a young man who can't get a date is sure if he goes to America, his accent will bring in women by the droves; and some sadness - something for everyone. What hooks all the stories together is the theme of love.There is a good deal of fantasy in the film - it's meant to be fun, light and sweet, and it succeeds. I didn't read the other reviews, but from some of the posters, I gather there were viewers who wanted something deeper. For me it's always best to take a film as intended and not wish for more. Surely Curtis had no expectation of heavy-duty story and character development when he utilized so many stories. The great soundtrack adds to the festivities. It's an ultimate feel-good movie, and it's the favorite film of many, including the person who sent it to me as a gift.",1,0,1,1,1,0,0
Love Actually,"After recently reading comments from posters on the tvguide.com site praise this movie, I decided to get this from Netflix to see for myself with my mom. Mom was a little put off by some of the nudity and adult humor though I remember laughing at much of those scenes. Not all funny scenes involved raunchy humor such as the one where Alan Rickman orders a necklace to be gift wrapped and Rowan Atkinson does quite a flourish on that to his consternation. Nice use of music too like ""All You Need is Love"" being performed at a wedding, ""Both Sides Now"" while Emma Thompson is crying, or ""God Only Knows"" at the ending scene. Oh, and a young girl performs a fine rendition of ""All I Want for Christmas is You"" at a pageant scene. All I'll say now is I liked Love Actually and I do recommend it.",1,0,0,0,1,0,0
Love Actually,"This film is about a group of individuals who have different love stories around Christmas time.I remember watching ""Love Actually"" when it first came out, and I was not impressed. Almost ten years later, I watched it again and found myself liking it. I was entertained by the lighthearted secretary played by Martine McCutcheon; touched by Liam Neeson's loss; saddened by Emma Thompson's experiences and felt sorry for Keira Knightley's lost chances. There is something for everyone, and everyone will find a subplot that parallels their life, and touches the heartstrings. Furthermore, the plethora of big names make the film even more enjoyable to watch (and the characters easier to follow).",1,1,1,0,0,1,0
Love Actually,"Love Actually is a romantic comedy that features an ensemble cast that includes Hugh Grant,Liam Neeson,Colin Firth,Laura Linney,Emma Thompson, Alan Rickman,Keira Knightley,Martine McCutcheon,Bill Nighy and Rowan Atkinson.The screenplay delves into different aspects of love as shown through ten separate stories involving a wide variety of individuals, many of whom are shown to be interlinked as their tales progress. It was written and directed by Richard Curtis. The story involves more than a dozen main characters, each weaving his or her way into another's heart over the course of one particularly eventful Christmas. The seemingly perfect wedding of Juliet and Peter brings many of the principals together, including heartsick best man Mark, who harbors a very unrequited crush on Juliet. There's also recent widower Daniel, trying to help his lonely stepson Sam express his true feelings to a classmate. Across town, devoted working mother Karen tries to rekindle the passion of her husband, Harry, who secretly pines for a young colleague of his. In the same office, the lonely Sarah not-so- secretly pines for a man just a few desks away, who returns her affections but may not be able to dissuade her neuroses. Providing the unofficial soundtrack for all of the couples is an aging rocker who just wants to cash in and get laid -- but even he might find a meaningful relationship in the most unlikely of places.Despite of the many characters involved,this is a actually a terrific film.There is plenty of entertainment in this well acted ensemble comedy considering that it has created a joyful date movie that'll leave you with a smile on your face and an almost irresistible urge to hug somebody.A highly recommended romantic comedy.",1,1,1,1,0,1,0
Love Actually,"Spoilers herein.I am a sucker for date movies: I laugh and cry - especially cry - along with the rest. And then feel violated afterwards by the asymmetry of reward: they get my money time and a piece of my soul and I get useless platitudes.This case is no different so far as formulaic and trivial romance. That's the nature of film love. But I did get something different here that made this worthwhile: competent writing for once.And yes, much of the writing - the structure I mean - is formulaic, but it was so well done. The matter is ordinary, but the manner of the machinery was novel.This film follows several recent experiments in presenting several stories that annotate one idea. The principle is that film abstracts and reduces, so if you want to get depth, you have to combine several reductions. `13 Conversations About One Thing,' `Things You Can Tell By Just Looking At Her,' `Ten Tiny Love Stories' and several others follow this route.The idea is that there is one prototypical woman, or couple. What you see as narrative are different dimensions of that. The problem for the writer is one of folded structure. Each individual story has to engage and have a dramatic arc, because that's where the viewers' attention will be. But the whole composition has to be woven into one experience, and that needs traditional cinematic shape as well.To help with this, the writer Curtis has pulled a number of tricks:-this is a piece of film writing, so some of his characters are in film (the sex body doubles) or writers (Firth) or in publishing (Rickman and his company including Linney). The Nighy character is a performer as well, often on TeeVee and provides the structural link to...-the tremendously effective integration of song and narrative. Song interfaces with the story in as many ways as there are stories: as traditional background, as a plot point: Joanna and Billy Mack, as a plot action (the kids, Grant's two adventures), as both in the Joni Mitchell bit.. And on and on in so many ways this could be as varied with song narrative as `Citizen Kane' meets `Singing Detective.'-The art of `bracketing.' That's where you set outposts that are intended to be different and unsuccessful so that the middle is raised. For instance, the `love' is bracketed on one side by the absurdly fantastic Wisconsin sequence and the heavily U.N. Date- movieish Linney problem with her brother. These were supposed to stand out, be different in tone and outside the main machinery.Other bracketing is obvious: the easy sex/love (Liam meets Claudia) and the seemingly impossible in the rock star's. This latter is emphasized in his sexy vixen video. And again between the love without sex (the love for the best friend's wife) and the sex without love (the body doubles).Yes, this is all known and taught. But it is good to see it all pulled off.The director Curtis pulls a great strategy:-write something extremely tight-get the most talented and independent actors possible-get out of their wayOne can see that the acting styles here are incoherent. They clearly do not spring from one mind, rather reflect whatever philosophy that actor has. This would be a flaw in another film, but here, the whole idea is to have different dimensions as part of the whole.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",1,1,1,1,0,-1,0
Love Actually,"London, England, and it's the run up to Christmas, and we are in the company of a number of couples dealing with the joys and problems that love can bring.We open with a narration from Hugh Grant who tells us that when he is troubled by the hate in the world, he thinks of the arrivals area of Heathrow airport. A place where loved ones greet returning loved ones, a place that indeed showcases a strand of love in its joyous form. He further ventures that when the aeroplanes hit the twin towers on 9/11, as far as he knows, all those phone calls from those sadly involved were messages of love, not hate. Pertinent musings that although somewhat sombre for an opening, sets it up nicely for what Richard Curtis (writer and director) wants to say.A roll call of fine British and Irish actors, and American Laura Linney, lend their considerable talents to Curtis' ensemble piece. The structure is surprisingly simple considering the number of stories being woven together, the result being that there is sure to be a story in there to either love, or, yes, even hate. Is it sentimental? Of course. Is it as stuffed as a turkey on Xmas day? Naturally. Does it stretch credibility in some strands? For sure. But only the coldest of hearts could truly decry that Love Actually is all around. Very often it's funny too. Curtis, following on from writing credits such as Four Weddings And A Funeral, continues to show himself to be a very fine writer of comedy. None more so than with Bill Nighy's past his sell by date pop star, Billy Mack. There's something for everyone in here, indeed there's likely to be something that many can associate with.It's a lovely affecting film that should hopefully perk up those that get blue around the holiday season. With perceptive writing, some excellent acting (Nighy, Emma Thomson, Colin Firth et al) and a soundtrack of some worth, Love Actually is a winner. 8/10",1,1,1,1,1,1,0
Love Actually,"This is a minor Richard Curtis' film, but if one is in the mood for something light, this is the movie to watch. Director Curtis has assembled an incredible array of British stars to create a film where everyone is about 6 degrees separated from the next person all the time.We have to congratulate Mr. Curtis for his musical ear, as he has selected great songs for the soundtrack. No other recent movie can flaunt a better array of love melodies to accompany the action in the film.Being this an ensemble piece, no one actor has a bigger role than another, but Hugh Grant certainly steals the film as the befuddled P.M. at the center of the action. In these troubled times, he would be a welcome influence to lead the world.",1,1,0,1,1,1,0
Love Actually,"A bunch of love stories that occur in December in London and all fall together on Christmas Eve. Bill Nighy plays a has-been rock star who rerecords one of his old hits as a Christmas songs. He's drugged out, beaten down and very very funny--and has no one to love. Hugh Grant plays the prime minister who falls for his assistant (the wonderful Martine McCutcheon). Colin Firth plays a man who just left his cheating wife and falls for a lovely Italian girl (Lucia Moniz) who really doesn't speak English. Alan Rickman plays an executive married to loving wife Emma Thompson and pursued by his sexy secretary Heike Makatsch. Kris Marshall plays a geeky English guy who flies all the way to America believing his accent will make him a stud. Laura Linney plays a secretary deeply (and understandingly) in love with hunky Rodrigo Santoro--but she has somebody else. Andrew Lincoln is secretly in love with his best friend's wife. Liam Neeson coaches his 11 year old stepson on how to get a girl. AND a guy falls for a woman while doing stand ins with her on a porno set.As you can see, there's plenty of material--too much. The film is overlong--but all the actors are just great (Thomson, Rickman, Grant, Linney and Firth are just unbelievable) and the film is bright, colorful and--just like real life--doesn't have all happy endings. Still, I loved every minute of this and recommend it highly.One warning--this is VERY R rated. The language is rough and there's plenty of casual nudity in the porn sketch.",1,1,0,0,0,1,0
Love Actually,"Watching this film, I couldn't help notice that life imitates art, with Liam Neeson suffering the loss of his wife, and now having to raise a young son (Thomas Sangster). He was, of course, simply magnificent.The real attraction for me was, of course, Hugh Grant. No, I am not gay, but I love that guy in everything he does. His attraction to Martine McCutcheon was so funny and worth the price of admission alone.But, there are 10 love stories in this movie, and each has its own particular charm, and fascinating characters.Keira Knightley was absolutely beautiful and a real delight in her character; Alan Rickman played a softer character than I have ever seen, and was magnificent; there were so many great characters like Colin Firth, Carla Vasconcelos, Emma Thompson, and Billy Bob Thornton. Did I mention High Grant? It was all tied together nicely by a magnificent performance by Bill Nighy.",1,1,0,0,0,1,0
Love Actually,"If you are in the right mood for it than this movie can be the ultimate feel good movie for you.It's all about the feeling the movie has. The atmosphere and directing is great. The movie shows that love is all around us without ever getting over dramatized.However when you start evaluating and start thinking more and more about the movie and its story you will notice that it is flawed. Not all of the story's are as good as the others and some of them end quite abrupt and aren't satisfying enough.The acting is good, Hugh Grant actually is convincing as the British prime-minister and if only the real prime-minister would say the things to the American president (a wonderful role played by Billy Bob Thornton in the movie) that he says in this movie...how cool would that be? I would love to see that happen. Liam Neeson plays a very nice role and Alan Rickman is always a pleasure to watch, so also in this movie. Bill Nighy provides the most comical elements of the movie and he does that in a very good and fun way. The movie is full with many cameo's of both British and American actors. Maybe a bit too much but that hardly is a complaint.But what was with all that nudity and cursing? Now, I'm not against nudity and cursing in movies in any way but I felt that for this movie it was out of place and not needed at all. A movie like this should be very light to watch for the entire family, both young and adults.But what am I complaining about this movie? This movie is one of those movies where you shouldn't be thinking about to much while watching. Just let the feelings and emotions grab you. The movie of course is best to watch with your lover by the way.Further more, the movie has a nice soundtrack with both evergreens and new hits.Excellent very fun romantic movie with an high feel good value.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",0,1,-1,1,1,1,0

It's a Wonderful Life,"This is a very good movie. Period. A ""classic"", I don't think so. This is a movie whose actual quality has been exceeded by its hype--though NOT because the producers or actors hyped it (like the typical overblown and over-hyped Hollywood film). In fact, when it was released it was not particularly successful (especially compared to other Frank Capra flicks).No, instead it reached legendary status for TWO reasons alone. It was a public domain video (hence NO ROYALTIES REQUIRED FOR SHOWING IT) AND its setting for the movie's conclusion was the holiday season. These two factors worked together to BLITZ the American public from the 1980s to the late 90s (until its copyright status was restored). I remember these dark days, when It's A Wonderful Life was literally shown on half a dozen channels at the same time!! Not even GREAT movies should be shown that much! As a result, many began proclaiming it a classic while some others got awfully tired of seeing it--which is a shame because it's a very good film.",0,-999,-999,-999,-999,-999,-999
It's a Wonderful Life,"It's a Wonderful Life is something truly special, and along with Scrooge, the original Miracle on 34th Street and Home Alones 1 and 2, it is something I watch every Christmas. Why? Because I love this movie, seriously I do. Looking through my 1000 or so reviews here, I couldn't believe I hadn't reviewed this movie; I have seen movies that I have loved and cherished since childhood and I have seen movies that belong at the bottom of the garbage. It's a Wonderful Life belongs to the former, although I am 17, I appreciate a good movie when I see one. This is more than a good movie, it's a timeless masterpiece, that holds up on repeated viewings and never loses its magic.It's a Wonderful Life could have easily been overly-sentimental and clichéd, but the quality of the direction and the screenplay that others have summed up perfectly assured it was a beautiful, heart-warming and somewhat poignant film. While there are some funny parts, not bursting-your-gut funny but funny in a subtle sort of way, other parts are close to heart-rending. The direction from Frank Capra is excellent, sensitive and nuanced, and Capra shows even more talent as a screenwriter having penned one of the most honest and touching scripts ever in a film. Casablanca, All About Eve and The Shawshank Redemption all had wonderful scripts, but the script here has a lot to say about community spirit and shows that this film is much more than feel-good sentimentality. There is the element of feel good here, no doubt about it, but it doesn't overpower what the film intends.Visually, It's a Wonderful Life is a wonder. I don't think it is dated at all, the cinematography is crisp, the black and white looks beautiful and the pristine Christmas scenery really does take me back. Some of my favourite ever memories was of Christmas, whether it was watching nostalgic Christmas videos, eating Christmas dinner or singing carols under the Christmas tree. Another thing I have to mention is that the movie is richly and beautifully scored, Dmitri Tiomkin's music here is absolutely gorgeous, lyrical, whimsical, nostalgic and most importantly it never felt intrusive in the more integral parts of the film. And I have to mention the story, never in my life(and I genuinely mean this) have I seen a movie where it communicates such a strong message and so well too. The story of a suicidal man who is shown the value of his life by his guardian angel is an effective, timeless one, imitated perhaps but never equalled.Finally the acting is wonderful. James Stewart, and I seriously don't give a damn whether he was a racist or not and neither should you, is absolutely superb as George Bailey, a truly complex character who goes through such a lot to get to where he is at the end of the movie. George Bailey is like Mr Deeds, John Doe and Mr Smith rolled into one, and in my opinion only James Stewart could have given justice to a character that has self-doubt gnawed at his essential decency. Also the character change, like that of Alistair Sim's Scrooge at the end of Scrooge, was heart-breakingly believable. Donna Reed is radiant and charming as his wife, who is like a caring lover, devoted wife and dedicated mother, while Thomas Mitchell gives one of his more memorable performances as Uncle Billy. Henry Travers is a revelation as Clarence the guardian angel, but there is another performance I think is worth of mention. For a good morality tale, you need a good villain. Well in the name of Potter, you have one. Who better to portray him than the great Lionel Barrymore acting at the peak of his powers? Overall, a timeless classic with a true and heart-rendingly poignant ending. 10/10, one of the easiest perfect scores I have made recently. Bethany Cox",1,1,1,1,1,1,1
It's a Wonderful Life,"I've always thought that the reason It's A Wonderful Life has had such enduring popularity is that more than in any other film it shows what can be the value of a single individual and the contribution to the greater good they can make.George Bailey as portrayed by James Stewart is the kind of every man hero we can all identify with. He's got the every day problems to be sure, raising and providing for a family, but he's got bigger problems than that. Fate has made him the rallying point of opposition in his small town of Bedford Falls to the ""richest and meanest man in town"", embodied in Lionel Barrymore.It's a real David vs. Goliath battle. Barrymore seems to have unlimited resources at his disposal. Samuel S. Hinds as Peter Bailey put it so well to him in asking what are you doing all this for? Barrymore does have more money than he could ever possibly use. A little charity wouldn't hurt him.Remember the basic plot outline. A whole lot of people in Bedford Falls one post World War II Christmas Eve see that their friend George is toting a heavy load of mysterious origins. Their prayers reach the heavens where an angel is dispatched to aid.But before Henry Travers the angel arrives, he's given the story of George Bailey's life. And we see the kind of struggles he's had, the sacrifices he's made for the good of a whole lot of others. We've also seen a greedy and grasping Potter, grabbing everything that George Bailey cannot save. Something happens that day before Christmas through no fault of his own, Bailey is in big trouble. It's driven him to the brink of despair. That's why the angel is sent down. He shows him the alternate universe that would have been had he never existed. It's something each and every one of us should try to do, step outside ourselves see just what our contributions can be.But I think what Frank Capra is trying to say in this greatest of his films is that having done that and we realize we haven't contributed to the greater good of humankind, we resolve to do so. It's a simple, but profound lesson.What if Potter got the same opportunity? In a sense Charles Dickens did just that in A Christmas Carol. Would Lionel Barrymore change? It's an interesting point of speculation.In addition to those cast members already mentioned a whole group of players who worked with Capra before grace this film. Add to that some others and you have a perfectly cast feature picture.Donna Reed has an interesting part as well. Your choice of mate is real important in life. Had she not been as loving and supportive to George Bailey, he might very well have taken a different route in life. Mary Hatch Bailey became a signature part for her, more identified than her role in From Here to Eternity which got her an Oscar. It certainly was the basis for her TV series.When Todd Karns who plays Harry Bailey toasts his brother he's saying that the riches of the world are not necessarily things that can be quantified. Your life is not measured in material things, but in how you use the material things given you. And that universal lesson will be taught into eternity as long as It's A Wonderful Life is shown every year. Wouldst we all learn it.",1,1,1,1,0,1,0
It's a Wonderful Life,"It's a Wonderful Life (1946)**** (out of 4) This timeless classic has James Stewart playing George Bailey, a frustrated businessman who gets the chance to see what the world would have been like had he never been born. I've lost count of how many times I've watched this film over the years but it keeps getting better with each new viewing and I can't help but notice new things each time I watch it. There's really nothing I could add that hasn't already been said about this movie but it's certainly one of my all time favorites and I'd argue that it's one of the greatest ever made. This movie has been called timeless by many people but I really can't think of too many movies where this is more true. I can't possibly see how this movie would ever grow old fashioned or out of touch because there's always going to be people who feel like the main character here. The most amazing thing to me is that the film perfectly captures how someone might begin to feel that they're worthless and I can't help but think that anyone who watches this movie will have a better look on life or themselves after watching it. I really can't think of too many movies that contain as much power as this one but I'd say that's why new fans are gained each and every passing year. The greatness of the film is certainly its heart but Stewart also deserves a lot of credit for his marvelous performance, which is certainly one of the best of his career. There are countless scenes in this movie where Stewart just nails it and I'm sure everyone knows the praying in the bar scene but there are many other great ones as well. On this viewing the scene on the bridge when Stewart begs for his life back hit me unlike any other time. There's also the scene in the bank where George has to bargain with the people not to take all of their money. Lionel Barrymore was always great playing bad guys and I can't help but think he's one of the greatest villains in movie history. The evilness that Barrymore is able to get through this character makes it among the actors best work. Donna Reed, Thomas Mitchell and Harry Travers also add great support. Every inch of this movie works flawlessly and that includes the sequences where George gets to see things as if he were never born. I think these moments contain Capra's greatest work as a director as the darkness and atmosphere he creates is so think and depression that it perfectly puts you in the mind frame of George. Then you've got that priceless ending, which ranks right up there with City Lights and Psycho as being the greatest for any movie.",1,1,1,1,0,1,0
It's a Wonderful Life,"Frank Capra's 1946 drama/fantasy IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE is one of the best-remembered films of all time, and it's no surprise; this moralistic tale of human suffering, poverty, greed, courage and determination is one that resounds through the ages, particularly so in our modern age of fat-cat bankers and a growing gap between rich and poor.James Stewart gives a dependably decent turn as George Bailey, a family man who finds himself at the mercy of Lionel Barrymore's criminal banker, Mr. Potter. What follows is lengthy and often profound, an occasionally twee but ultimately moving exploration of the human character and the effect one man can have on his world.What I particularly liked about IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE is the way that every part of the narrative hangs together without any unnecessary extras. Even the little bits like the accident on the ice at the outset later come back to haunt our characters. It's very well written, and expertly directed by Frank Capra; an unashamedly old-fashioned, heart-warming and sentimental piece of movie-making on a grand scale. I'd even go so far as to call it the ultimate Christmas film.",1,0,1,1,0,0,0

An angel named Clarence is assigned to give George a second chance by showing him what if he was never born.This is an unabashed sentimental tear jerker. The movie starts with George's life as it is. His dream is to travel the world, and create great monuments. He is constantly dragged back to the unimpressive little Bedford Falls and the family Savings and Loans. He is a good guy who constantly does the right thing.This is classic Frank Capra. The nice guy struggles but always win in the end.

It's a Wonderful Life,"Once again, my two cents' worth of a film that is the darling of so many people, myself included. It has its uplifting conclusion, and the theme that every life has its purpose in the great scheme of things. George Bailey is in trouble. He has decided to end it all. The thought of jail and disgrace is more than he can handle. George's life has been a continual parade of missed opportunities. There is a layer of pain just above the surface of nearly every scene. George is a victim and this series of disappointments takes its toll. He eventually becomes hardened and frustrated, but because he is honorable, he goes about the business of living. He has gifts he doesn't realize. He has family. He has status, and while not often appreciated, he is. Unfortunately, we don't always share our love and admiration with those who deserve it. His sense of adventure from birth has been clutched from him over and over. His bad ear makes the army an impossibility, his father's death forces him to run a business he wants to run away from, and even his honeymoon money is used to prevent a run on the bank. George never knows his importance until Henry Travers' well meaning angel comes along.I love this movie, but I also take it seriously. It can be painful to watch sometimes. The best scenes are the ones where George never existed. His despair is evident and the tension builds higher and higher. When he comes back, such a weight that is lifted. Jimmy Stewart is at the top of his acting form; I loved him as a living human being and as an actor; he portrays the kindness I believe the world should have.And then there is Donna Reed, Lionel Barrymore, Ward Bond, and all the others. They are superb. It's a question all of us have wrestled with: ""What if we had never existed?"" There is no peer in Capra's canon. I truly believe that this is a necessary part of our heritage. We need to see things as they should be. I love Christmas because it at least portends to be the time we all look at our gifts.

It's a Wonderful Life,"`George Bailey is a pillar of his community whose life has been selflessly dedicated to the welfare of others. Through the evil machinations of the town's business mogul, George is driven to the point of suicide. In answer to the prayers of the townsfolk, a missing angel comes to the rescue. He shows George what a sad and sorry place the town would have been without him. Can this life George out of his despair?'Who hasn't seen this film? Anyone? It is an unashamed tribute to homely values and is hugely warming. The story itself is not exactly rocket science, but it is does contain plenty of nice touches as we follow George through his life of missed opportunities and sacrifice through to his marriage and eventual down fall. The world that this happens seems so distant nowadays, with our friendless society - so few people do anything for their fellow man in big cities etc. So this is very touching to see a man who serves others in such a major way. It is a story of how every little helps and how you cannot overdo friendly gestures.Stewart is excellent with his partner Capra. Barrymore is also excellent in a thankless role - he represents all that is wrong in society and of course he rises to a powerful position. Henry Travers is good as Clarence, the wingless angel and of course who can forget the excellent Donna Reed as Mary.It's pure hokum of course, the regular Christmas movie that lifts everyone's spirits. But isn't this what we all wish the world was like really? Why can't it be - if only for two hours. This is what Stewart and Capra do best - enjoy and forget the real world.",1,1,1,1,0,1,0
It's a Wonderful Life,"On the Christmas Eve of Bedford Falls, the guardian angel Clarence (Henry Travers) is assigned to convince the desperate George Bailey (James Stewart) to not commit suicide. George is a good man, that sacrificed his dreams and his youth on behalf of the citizens of his small town. He inherited the loan business of his father and he gave up traveling the world and joining the university as scheduled. Later he resisted the proposals of the evil banker Mr. Potter (Lionel Barrymore) and has never sold his business to protect the poor community of Bedford Falls and offer a means to afford to buy their own house. He married his beloved Mary Hatch Bailey (Donna Reed) and had four children with her and a tough life with his family. When his uncle Billy (Thomas Mitchell) loses US$ 8,000.00, found and stolen by Mr. Potter, George decides to commit suicide, since he believes he worth more dead than alive. When Clarence sees that he is not able to persuade George to give up his intention, he decides to show the life in town if George had never existed. George concludes that life is wonderful.""It's a Wonderful Life"" is certainly one of the most beautiful movies of the cinema history ever. This masterpiece has a touching and moralist story, showing that the famous sentence that a man can make the difference is true. Everything works perfectly in this movie. The original screenplay develops the situation and the characters accurately, using flashbacks and magnificent lines. The direction of Frank Capra is outstanding as usual. The cinematography in black & white and using shadows and lights is fantastic. James Stewart leads an amazing cast, showing a perfect chemistry with the gorgeous Donna Reed, in the role of a compassionate and enlightened good man. Lionel Barrymore is also amazing in the role of the despicable banker. I do not recall how many times I have already seen this film, but last time was 16 Dec 2000.

It's a Wonderful Life,"In looking at this glorious Christmas classic, it's easy to get so involved in the psychology behind it. we obviously become so caught up in our own lives that we often forget about how others around us have influenced who we become and vice versa. This film, which has been redone in many different forms, including taking popular characters from TV shows, both daytime and nighttime and putting them in the same situation as Jimmy Stewart, truly stands the test of time. Not only is it watching one man's slow destruction from things that seem to be beyond his control, it's seeing how one person can deal with the ruthless machinations of the pure evil around him and open the eyes of everybody else to see what's really going on.In a return to the Christmas theme that he earlier used in 1941 classic ""Meet John Doe"", director Frank Capra saves the seasonal Twist of the story for the film's last half-hour. An unseen angel is sent to a small town to aid a possible suicide victim when the actions of the greedy and evil Lionel Barrymore threatens to send him to prison for embezzlement. Stewart's life is seen in flashbacks for much of the film, but when the film joins the present day, it is almost like it has gone some 70 years into the future to today with Barrymore representing the truly evil Scrooge like banker who wants to control everybody's life.It is quite a shocker to see Barrymore playing such a nasty, evil man after playing the kindly Dr. Gillespie in the series of MGM medical dramas. he is basically expanding the role of Scrooge which he did on radio for many years and adds an essence of true malevolence to his characterization. Even Scrooge wasn't as crass as his character here. It seems to be a continuation of the role that Edward Arnold played so beautifully in Capra's earlier films ""Mr Smith Goes to Washington"" and ""Meet John Doe"".The lovely Donna Reed crosses over from MGM ingenue to classy leading lady, adding much depth to her role of Stewart's girlfriend, later wife, with Beulah Bondi saintly as usual his lovable mother. (Bondi played Stewart's mother in so many films and on TV that it is obvious that somehow in real life, he did call her ma.) Then there's Gloria Grahame as the town flirt, Thomas Mitchell as Stewart's rascal uncle, and of course Henry Travers as Clarence, the angel who desperately wants his wings. The smaller roles are filled out by many familiar actors, some of whom were in pretty much every Capra film, as well as Danny Mummert and Larry Simms, both from the ""Blondie"" series and Karolyn Grimes, an underrated child star who stole many movie programmers in the mid-1940s.There are so many other things to credit for this film's excellence beyond the cast and direction, namely the brilliant script, fast pacing and brilliant production design. This film holds up regardless of whether you see it in its original black-and-white form or it's decently restored colorized version. I'm not in favor of colorizing classic movies, but somehow this one actually came out all right. while I watch this one every other year rather than every year, I can say that I am continuously touched and discover new seems in its that I had not seen before. It is no wonder that this is on nearlt everybody's list of the top Christmas movies of all time.",1,1,1,1,0,1,0

He has a wife Mary (Donna Reed) and four children in an old house which they make their home.On Christmas Eve, George's Uncle Bill loses $8000 while he is attempting to deposit the money in the bank but loses track when he brags to the town bigwig Mr Potter. The Bailey family nemesis, Mr Potter (Lionel Barrymore) finds the cash but keeps it to himself. George realises when the bank auditor finds out that the accounts do not match he might lose everything and go to jail. George decides to kill himself However an angel Clarence (Henry Travers) is sent to save him and to show him how valuable his life is to the people around him by taking him to the time as if he was never born where he sees an alternate timeline. George discovers that he has made a positive contribution to many peoples lives.The story has been told many times since then in television, books and films. Even the last episode of Classic Dallas was a variant of this movie based on the Ewings if JR was not around!The film is regarded as an all time classic and it does have merits for being novel such as the beginning of the picture with a supreme being calling for an angel and the angel being one who has yet to gain his wings that is another story done many time since.The film is charming, winsome but also a shade too long. The alternate timeline where the town becomes a cesspit looks improbable with Mary being a spinster librarian, a friend of George (Violet) becoming a good time girl and other townsfolk becoming nasty and rather brutish.Also Mr Potter never seems to get his comeuppance, even during the days of the code Mr Potter still managed to find a way round things!",0,-999,0,0,-999,-999,-999

It's a Wonderful Life,"I've only watched this revered classic film one time. It was okay but disappointing. I expected more after hearing of its great reputation. True, it was interesting but it had too many frustrating and annoying parts for my tastes. It was not the feel-good film I was expecting.I admit the ending was terrific and brings a tear to one's eye with an inspiring message but much of the film deals with tough breaks that ""George Bailey"" (Jimmy Stewart) had to face and also featured a very mean, despicable dishonest man in ""Mr. Potter"" (Lionel Barrymore). A lot of those scenes were not fun to watch; more frustrating than anything else. The movie has several scenes in which Bailey isn't the best person, either, but it could be argued that everyone has their moments, so why not him, too? Since this is so beloved a film, and such a Christmas favorite, I just expected more of a nice, lighthearted, good-natured story. Instead, I got a very dramatic movie with a number of unpleasant scenes.Interesting that this would be a Christmas favorite when Stewart's character admits he doesn't know if God answers prayer, or if He's even there. All of this coming from a guy who's attended church for years? Well, at least he found out, and it was a good message.The ""message"" was that everyone's life counts for something, that life is important and what you do with it especially important because it effects not just you but a number of other people many times in ways you could never imagine.To its credit, the story is an involving one.

It's a Wonderful Life,"This is the best Christmas film ever made from Golden Globe winning, and Oscar nominated director Frank Capra. The film begins with seeing most of the past of George Bailey (Oscar nominated James Stewart), before going to the present day, Christmas Eve, where he, as a businessman is losing the plot of life, including living with his wife Mary Bailey (Donna Reed) and his kids. Also, Mr. Potter (Lionel Barrymore) is threatening George with asking for money and trying to tempt George into buying the Baileys business. When money goes missing, Potter won't help him (for being rude) and he has a fit with his wife and kids, he soon thinks about ending his life. Until he meets Clarence (Henry Travers), who calls himself an angel without wings, he can only earn them by helping George. To prove himself, Clarence grants George the wish that he never existed. When George goes back to town everything has changed, the twon is called Pottersville instead of Bedford Fals, members of his family are no longer around, and nobody recognises him, not even his wife. When George discovers how much of a difference he makes to the city he wishes to be back again. It is heart-warming when he is so happy to be back to normal and he ends up as a millionaire, and Clarence got his wings. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Film Editing, Best Sound and Best Picture. James Stewart number 12 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, he was number 3 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Men, and he was number 13 on The World's Greatest Actor, George Bailey was number 9 (Hero) and Mr. Potter was number 6 (Villain) on 100 Years, 100 Heroes & Villains, the film was number 4 on The 100 Greatest Tearjerkers for the happy ending, it was number 8 on 100 Years, 100 Passions, it was number 37 on The 100 Greatest Family Films, it was number 10 on The 100 Greatest Christmas Moments, it was number 11 on 100 Years, 100 Movies, it was number 1 on 100 Years, 100 Cheers, and it was number 7 on The 100 Greatest Films.

It's a Wonderful Life,"If there's one movie I probably haven't watched enough times, it would be ""It's a Wonderful Life"". The characters, the situations, the message all come together in a way that intrinsically defines it as a Christmas movie, but when you get right down to it, the film transcends Christmas in a way that's truly heartwarming and magical. Jimmy Stewart had that unique ability to put the Everyman into his roles, and this picture certainly qualifies as one of his finest performances. Donna Reed could not have been a better choice to play Mary, displaying a wholesome sex appeal to go along with those traditional home town American values that pictures of the era were so skillful in portraying. Had Director Frank Capra made only this one picture, it would have earned him recognition as one of the true masters of cinema. I could go on and on, but there's really no point in trying to heap further accolades on a picture that has earned it's place in American film right at the top.

It's a Wonderful Life,"This classic film opens with the voices of various people praying for George Bailey; it is clear that their prayers will be answered when voices in the heavens discuss how to help him. Angel Clarence will be assigned to save George but first Clarence, and the audience, must see how George came to be considering suicide. As a child George Bailey dreamt of getting out of the small town of Bedford Falls; he wanted to see the world, get an education then make his mark on the world. It wasn't to be though; he constantly sacrifices his dreams to help others. This leaves him stuck in the town running the savings and loan company that his father ran. It isn't a job he wanted but he does it anyway giving loans to people nobody else will help. This makes him popular with everybody apart from the miserly Mr. Potter who doesn't like to see the people who were paying him to rent slums buying their own houses. The years pass and George gets married and has children; he isn't rich but he is content; then one day Potter gets the opportunity to ruin George; thinking the only way he can help his family is to kill himself for the insurance we get to the point the film started. As he hits the depth of despair Clarence appears in his life and showed him just what the town would have been like if George had never been born; a miserably place full of bitter people lorded over by the odious Potter. When George returns he understands what good friends he has.I'd obviously heard of this film a long time ago but had somehow never seen it until today. I knew the film was considered a classic and think James Stewart was a fine actor so I had to watch it when it was on television. Now that I have seen it I ban see why it is held in such high regard. I was a little put off by the opening but once we started seeing George's life from the time he saved his brother's life when he was twelve till the very end I was engrossed. Stewart did a great job as George; the man destined to miss out on his dream each time it looked as though it would come true... even the moment he was about to go away on his honeymoon was ruined meaning he couldn't go. It isn't all disappointment though; there are many joyful scenes as George helps various people and falls in love and then marries Mary Hatch. By the end it is likely that the viewer will have shed tears of both sorrow and joy.

It's a Wonderful Life,"Heartwarming Frank Capra film which has become (quite unintentionally, I presume) a Christmas perennial. Set in small town America, James Stewart stars as a discouraged and suicidal banker who learns a lesson about life from an angel anxious to get his wings. Fantasy with a holiday theme took many years to garner its classic status, yet it's a shrewd mixture of comedic, dramatic, and emotional elements. Capra's direction is quite sensitive, creating an evocative overview of middle America and the struggling working class. Stewart gives his usual sterling performance, and Donna Reed is a good romantic screen match for him; Henry Travers is the perfect twinkle-eyed old angel. Capra also co-adapted the screenplay based on the short story ""The Greatest Gift"" (which seems to have a touch of Dickens as well).

It's a Wonderful Life,"My wife and I chose this for our Christmas night viewing even though we have seen it before. It is currently available on Amazon streaming movies.WW2 ended in 1945 and this movie was made in 1946. The premise is straightforward, George Bailey ( James Stewart, 38 at the time) had been a fine boy growing up and now as an adult often gave up his own goals for the benefit of others, like his younger brother. Perhaps too generous, when his Building and Loan business was in trouble he was contemplating suicide as a way out, thinking the world would be better off if George Bailey had never existed.An angel is sent down to intervene, in the last third of the movie George gets to see exactly how his town would have been and in the process gets his head straight.Donna Reed (23 at the time) played his wife Mary who would have been the stereotypical ""old maid librarian"" if George had never existed.Filmed in glorious B&W, the film holds up very well all these years later when one pits it against other very old movies.",1,0,1,0,0,0,1
It's a Wonderful Life,"I should be inclined to say that Frank Capra made his masterpiece with It's a Wonderful Life, and it would probably be the obvious, easy answer to make as a movie-lover. And shock of shocks, it wasn't until today (of Christmas Eve of all times, ho-ho-ho) that I finally sat down and watched it- it wasn't a 'family staple' in my house- but I knew I had to watch it, if only to see James Stewart in the seminal role of George Bailey. It is, no doubt, with enough fantastical scenes to make up a couple more movies, and the heart that sits right in It's a Wonderful Life beats with all the vigor and pride of the most schmaltzy- and rightly proud of it- American spirit. That I ended up not finding it to be a truly astonishing movie may be that I'm just a cynic deep down, or that maybe this kind of story, and how it plays out, has ended up being done so many times I practically knew what the story was before going in. It's the most amazing of credits to Capra and his cast and crew that it does hold up this well, and that the sentimentality stringing together much of what happens is actually well earned. But it does teeter on becoming a bit too dated, or rather that it's appeal of being a fable really only works best when dealing with the crux of the character George Bailey, and almost becomes weird in how it leaps from great happiness to the terrible bleakness of modern American life.Indeed, Stewart was not only the best choice for George Bailey, but the correct one, the kind we'd probably all like to have in our town as the man who despite his better senses commits his life to being there for the ones he cares for. It almost becomes a running gag, however not really funny as much as touching, the way he puts aside his own feelings and self-wants to help save the bank and Bedford Falls from the peril that could come from the dastardly Potter (Lionel Barrymore, cast perfectly for the role as well with his sinister eyebrows and cunning attitude). I first thought it would be all about George seeing life as if he had never been born, but really this is(wisely) kept to the last twenty minutes of the picture. This works because we see how Bailey gets to that point of almost jumping off into the river, which in its selfish way would be, to him, still a selfless act (i.e. worth more than dead). Seeing George's life is like peering into one of those tall-tale American stories where the little guy gets a lot done by just being himself- or at least his better self getting the better of him. All George wants to do as a young man is explore the world, make great buildings and things. But any lofty ambition becomes squashed by reality- of his father's death, of the very sneaky attitude imposed by Potter, and by the townspeople practically needing some hope during the depression. So it's up to him to not only save the town by making a section of the town named after him for low-cost housing, but to marry a girl Mary (Donna Reed) who's fallen totally for George.What ends up being most memorable, for me, about It's a Wonderful Life is the skill which Capra makes possibly one-dimensional figures very real and immediate, and that in this seemingly simplistic world of right and wrong and good and bad there are the slivers of gray that work their way in. I loved one scene in particular where Potter, desperate to gain back control over his possible monopoly in Bedford Falls, tries to will George away to work for him at far more an amount of money he would make on his own terms with his small bank. It's a tense scene in how devilish Potter comes off, and how Barrymore turns on the ideal of greed and necessity and the ego of a man over the higher principles that George ultimately goes for. It's always fascinating too to see how Stewart plays certain scenes and lines and inflections, moments of surprise and delight which probably hide just the bits of bitterness that build up in him. There's something about the American dream that is called into question in American life, even as Capra likes to jump from sweet touches of light comedy to stark tragedy or danger. There's a great juxtaposition that is made too with the characters of Harry Bailey, George's brother, who goes on to lead the life George might have led had he not saved Harry as a boy, and as well in a small part with Sam Wainwright.It's through the sort of realistic groundings then that Capra is able to get away with reaching for the fantasy structure that ends up coming out of the film, the typical 'what if' nightmare scenario that has ended up influencing countless movies and TV shows. Like Christmas Carol, though sort of in reverse, it's sort of meant as a lesson in humanity, and how what is carried in a man or what is lacking in it ends up bringing it out or losing it in others. It all builds to help Capra earn the melodrama and ultra-heightened emotions brought out with Clarence the angel. It doesn't mean that, at least for me, there aren't things that end up being dated (however, scenes like the dance-hall bit in 1928, is timeless in its humor), mainly in how the idealism and old-fashioned ways come out in this day & age. But still, it doesn't stop me from saying that It's a Wonderful Life is a must see, if only once, and there's no doubt why it's been revered as one of the great films about the triumph of the human spirit.

It's a Wonderful Life,"Frank Capra's sometimes dark post-war film, ""It's a Wonderful Life"" was released in 1946. It was intended to be released in 1947, but when a Technicolor print of ""Sinbad"" couldn't be delivered on time, this film was put into release. For that reason, ""It's a Wonderful Life"" - possibly the most wonderful film ever made - was overshadowed by ""The Best Years of Our Lives."" But you can't keep a great film down, and as the years have passed, ""It's a Wonderful Life"" has found its place as an iconic film that means Christmas. It's survived the public domain (due to a clerical error, when the copyright was not renewed in 1974), where it was cut to ribbons and shown so often on television (and why not, networks could show it for nothing) that people were sick of it. Now that it has to be licensed again in order to be shown, the film is shown in its totality and not as often.This remarkable story of a man who sacrifices his dreams for the betterment of his community and the business his father built resonates today more than ever, when it often seems like no one cares about anything except what's in it for them. James Stewart is perfect as a caring man who swallows disappointment after disappointment and finally is ready to give up, until he is given the gift of seeing what would have happened had he never been born. No man, he learns, is poor who has friends.I can't think of a better message or anything more inspirational than can be found in this film.

That no matter how disappointed you are about your life and yourself, just take a step back and see how you may have affected other people's lives. How many good things would not have happened if you weren't there.

Alex D Linz gives a spirited performance in Home Alone 3, but Michael Weinburg just doesn't do anything with the script(which was terrible), other than whine in the fourth film. Anyway back to Home Alone. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern steal the film, with their goofiness and charm that was evidently missed in the last two instalments. Matching them, is the late great John Candy, and here he is wonderful. Candy has starred in movies like Uncle Buck and Planes, Trains and Automobiles, both of which are hilarious. Home Alone just broadens the comedic talent, that Candy certainly had. The film looks beautiful, with very good direction, and best of all great visual jokes and traps, as well as a fun and sometimes touching script. My problem is why is the rating for both Home Alone and Home 2 so low, when almost everyone I know consider them as holiday classics?

He believes that his hopes have been answered but soon he's having to deal with a couple burglars (Joe Pesci, Daniel Stern) who have their eyes on his house.If you were around in 1990 then you will remember the tremendous success that HOME ALONE had with critics, fans and at the box office. To say the film was a landmark would be an understatement because the film was a huge hit and has gained plenty of fans over the years. After twenty-six years I think it's safe to say that the film is a new classic. While the film isn't perfect it's certainly a lot of fun and perfectly captures the manic spirit of Christmas time.What makes the film work so well is that it's a perfect child fantasy. I'm sure many kids have wished that they were the boss, the keeper of the house and that the adults would just go away. This film works perfectly fulfilling that fantasy but of course there's the more touching moments thrown in for good measure. What makes the film a classic are the battles between the kid and the burglars. Culkin, Pesci and Stern would all become household names after this film and it's easy to see why.Culkin is absolutely adorable as the brat kid who finds himself home alone and doing battle against his fears as well as the two bad guys. The violence in the film is in the same field as The Three Stooges and it works perfectly well. Not only does the violence work but it's perfectly sold by Pesci and Stern who are terrific and easily steal the film as Harry and Marv. The two of them have perfect chemistry together and they really make for a great comic team.The supporting cast is very good with the likes of John Heard, Roberts Blossom, Catherine O'Hara and John Candy all doing fine work. Another major plus is the score from John Williams as well as an all-around great charm. The film contains some great laughs throughout and I think after all these years it's fair to call it a classic.",1,1,0,0,0,1,0
Home Alone,"I saw and loved HOME ALONE as a kid, particularly enjoying all the 'home invasion' traps that Kevin McCallister set up for the bad guys. Watching it nowadays, I'm surprised to see that this sequence only takes up the last quarter of the movie; before then there's a surprisingly complex storyline with some good sub-plots to keep it moving nicely along.That this also turns out to be a classic film which has lost none of its warmth and magic is the biggest surprise. Yes, Macaulay Culkin is more than a little annoying when you watch him as an adult - in fact, I remember him being annoying when I watched him as a kid - but you can forgive him because he's endearing nonetheless. Of the supporting cast, the ones who particularly shine are Joe Pesci (channelling some of that GOODFELLAS energy), Daniel Stern, and Roberts Blossom (DERANGED).The film was written by John Hughes, so the expected sentimentality is here, but somehow it never becomes too cloying - you can live with it, because there's plenty of good stuff elsewhere. That home invasion stuff is still superbly directed, surprisingly violent, and very funny, and there's so much ingenuity packed into the running time that this is a film impossible to dislike. In fact, I still love it.",1,1,0,1,0,0,0
Home Alone,"Kevin McCallister (Macaulay Culkin) is the youngest of a large family. They are preparing to go to Paris for Christmas. The power goes out overnight, and none of the clocks work. The family rushes to get on the plane and leave little Kevin behind. The Wet Bandits, Harry Lyme (Joe Pesci) and Marv Merchants (Daniel Stern), come to town to rob the McCallister home only to battle Kevin and his home made traps.Director Chris Columbus and writer John Hughes team up to create one of the most iconic comedies of its era. It's in no small part due to the iconic scene of Macaulay Culkin slapping his face and Scream. Take it away, it's a rather crass juvenile kiddie movie. I'm not complaining, just explaining. Expect a lot of slapstick stupidity with the annoying Wet Bandits.",0,0,0,1,-999,0,-999
Home Alone,"This year it is already 24 years ago that Chris Columbus' ""Home Alone"" starring Macaulay Culkin was released and the film gets shown pretty much every holiday season here. It also scored 2 Academy Award nominations, probably mostly because it was by far the most commercially successful movie in the United States in 1990. Of course, that is also why so far there have been three sequels, with only the second starring the lead actor and most of the original cast in ""Home Alone 2: Lost in New York"". Columbus directed this sequel as well and later worked on ""Mrs Doubtfire"" and several ""Harry Potter"" films.One of the strengths of ""Home Alone"" is that also all the smaller characters bring quite some charm and fun. Kevin's uncle (especially during his scenes in the plane) is my favorite smaller funny character and Old Man Marley brings the emotional highlights here. That church scene was particularly wonderful. What a shame the actor is not alive anymore. Same goes for the film's writer John Hughes and John Candy, who both died way too early. Mentioning John Hughes, I was a bit surprised that the smoking Santa was not him in a small role. He exactly looked that way. You may have seen some of Hughes' other very known works such as ""The Breakfast Club"", ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"", ""101 Dalmatians"" and many more.Another mention goes out to Joe Pesci, who has had a true career year in 1990. Here he plays the chubby, slightly smarter villain (over Daniel Stern's character) compared to his completely sinister mafiosi gangster turn in ""Goodfellas"", which won him the Oscar that year. Culkin was nominated for a Golden Globe in the musical/comedy actor category, but lost to Gerard Depardieu, who won for the only movie from all the nominees which is not considered a classic or close to that description today.""Home Alone"" runs for roughly 100 minutes and will make you laugh a lot and also touch you. The latter happened for me mostly with the old man with the snow shovel and how meeting Kevin impacts his life. My favorite funny scene was the gangster film playing with the poor pizza guy coming along. I saw it so often already, but it never fails to crack me up. I am not sure if I would call this movie a classic or even an epic, but it is certainly worth a watch. Recommended.",1,1,1,1,1,1,0
Home Alone,"My response to this movie is strictly prejudiced. For all it violence and lack of verisimilitude, I get a kick out it ever time I see it. If one can't get past the fact that the Wile E. Coyote element is in here (where no one ever seems to get hurt, no matter what), you aren't going to have much fun. With that caveat, the movie is a bit of a hoot. McCauley Culkin came to stardom in this (it's too bad his life became unsettled after this). Watching Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern, the ever optimistic though doomed villains, continue to fight a losing cause against an eight year old is the stuff cartoons are made of. Their mugging as they try one thing after another, only to be thwarted, is great fun. The subplot of the mother hooking up with a polka band, led by the inimitable John Candy, adds an element of joy. There is also the relationship that grows with a frightening man next door who has been tabbed a murderer by the insensitivity of the neighborhood kids. This man is estranged from his son and has lapsed into a sad existence. This raises this up from just a kid movie to one with a bit more substance. Anyway, don't take it to seriously and one may have a bit of fun at the holidays.",0,0,0,-999,-999,0,-999

Home Alone,"After being accidentally left home alone by his family, Kevin McAllister (Macaulay Culkin) must defend his residence from the Wet Bandits (Daniel Stern and Joe Pesci), who are for some reason obsessed with the idea of hurting the little boy and stealing useless knick-knacks.This film is a legend and a classic. Released in 1990, it captures both the more serious 1990s with the fun 1980s. Two 1980s masters come together to film this one: John Hughes as writer (""Sixteen Candles"", ""Pretty in Pink"", ""The Breakfast Club"") and Chris Columbus as director (""Adventures in Babysitting""). This makes for the perfect blend in young adult situation comedy.This is the film that launched Macaulay Culkin's career. While he had previously appeared in ""Jacob's Ladder"" and ""Uncle Buck"", this was (and remains) his biggest and most cherished role. I would find it safe to say no film since has really captured the essence of Macaulay. While ""Saved"" and ""Party Monster"" are both (possibly) equally as good movies, they do not have the mass appeal of ""Home Alone"".What is best about the film is its sense of fun. The plot really makes little sense. How does a family not notice they have an extra plane ticket or that a sibling is missing? Why would burglars break into a house where they can be identified? How can Joe Pesci get beat up relentlessly and not curse once? Is it possible to not have a single friend, family member or neighbor in all of Chicago? The ""Scream"" joke was used too much (four times). At least one, and probably two, instances could have been removed. Do we need to see a little boy twice getting burned by aftershave? Of course not. The repeated use of the ""keep the change you filthy animal"" joke seemed to work very well, though, strangely enough.Overall, this is a great Christmas movie. Along with ""Die Hard"" this is one you really need to make sure you watch around the holidays, at least once. If you have never seen ""Home Alone"" you are one of five people on earth or something... it was a huge success. With good reason. So see it.",1,0,-1,1,-999,0,-999
Home Alone,"This an absurd storyline. Hollywood loves to show movies in which kids are smarter than adults, for some reason. Also, we are expected to believe a big family can go all the way to the airport and then fly to France before finding out one of their kids was left at home??! I don't think so. I know a lot of big families and this would never-in-a-million years happen.However, it's just a movie, and it isn't real and you can't take any of it seriously. Thus, the idea is to go along with the wild premise and enjoy the antics that follow....and there are plenty of those!A share of the credit for the big success of this film should go to God, who made Maccaulay Culkin's face. Without it, I doubt this would have been anywhere near the hit is was, but Culkin's ""cuteness"" helps makes you root for him and his facial expressions provide a lot of laughs. He turned out to be a fine child actor.The two guys (Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern) that play incompetent crooks are funny and some of the humor is clever, although slapstick ""rules"" in this film.There are some really nice messages in here, such as ""families suck,"" says the kid. Oh, well, some think this film did, too. I am not a big fan of it, but I did enjoy it along with most other people. I thought the sequel was better, though.",0,1,-1,-999,-999,1,-999
Home Alone,"When I heard Daniel Stern speak at Lewis & Clark College in September, 2004, about his USO tour in Iraq, he said that while ""Home Alone"" had a bunch of silly gags, at least it only had them once; the sequel just repeated everything. When you think about it, that makes sense. This movie was funny the first time (I certainly loved it when I saw it in the theaters), but not much after that. I gotta ask: what happened to John Hughes? In the '80s, he made movies like ""The Breakfast Club"", ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"", and ""Planes, Trains & Automobiles""; in the '90s, he got into dropping things on people's heads (think ""Home Alone"" and ""Baby's Day Out""). Oh well, life goes on. And for the record, Daniel Stern also said that when he was in Iraq, some Iraqi children recognized him from this movie; that made him understand the reach of American culture.",0,-999,-999,-999,-999,-999,-999
Home Alone,"If you like a really good family film at Christmas, then there's a big difference, there is no family in this film (or at least for most of it). The McCallister family are preparing a Christmas holiday to Paris. The night before they leave the youngest child of the family causes trouble and is sent to bed early. He wishes that the family would disappear. The next morning, the family leave and realise when they are in Paris that they have forgot one thing, Kevin (Golden Globe nominated Macaulay Culkin)! Kevin now has all the fun that he wants. Only problem is that two crooks Harry and Marv (Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern) are trying to get into the large house to loot it. This is just wonderful for goofy live action gags, kids entertainment and Christmas fun. Also starring John Heard as Peter McCallister, Roberts Blossom as Marley and Catherine O'Hara as Kate McCallister.

Home Alone,"The night before eight year old Kevin and his family are due to depart for their Christmas holidays in Paris he misbehaves and is sent to bed early; feeling hard done by he wishes they would disappear. In the morning events conspire to cause a rushed departure and Kevin is accidentally left behind in the panic; when he wakes up his wish has come true! His parents meanwhile have discovered their mistake and are struggling desperately to find a way to get back to Chicago. With nobody to look after him Kevin quickly learns to look after himself. Meanwhile Harry and Marv, a pair of burglars, are robbing houses in the area and the one they consider the best target is Kevin's; he will have to be extra smart if he is to prevent a robbery. On the first night he tricks them into believing there is a party on but he won't be so lucky the next time but the neither will Harry and Marv; by the time they return Kevin has prepared an interesting welcome for them; one that will leave them bleeding, burnt, bruised and battered!When I first watched this film over twenty years ago I was surprised just how much I laughed and watching it again now it is just as funny; the early part of the film has a decent number of laughs but later on when the attempted burglary takes place it is hysterically funny in a slightly malicious way; Harry and Marv may be unpleasant criminals but I'm not sure anybody deserves what happens to them! Young Macaulay Culkin does a great job as Kevin; he really managed to carry the film. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern were also entertaining as the two burglars. While it is primarily a comedy there are some touching moments; most notably when Kevin talks to the scary neighbour and learns that he hasn't spoken to his son for years because of a silly argument. Overall I'd say this is a great film that can be enjoyed by young and old alike; definitely one to watch!",1,1,1,0,0,1,0
Home Alone,"""Home Alone"", directed by Chris Columbus from a screenplay by '80s golden boy John Hughes, has pleased millions of people, and is a not-unintentional holiday perennial as well, taking place as it does during the Christmas season. It is a film that operates at a level at which any sort of professional criticism is no longer helpful. Youngster is (improbably) left behind after his large family packs up and leaves for the airport to vacation in Paris; he fends off two inept burglars while mom makes her way back home. Macaulay Culkin plays the main character, Kevin, but there really is no character; Culkin succeeds in the role strictly by playing up his inherent precociousness--most often directly to the camera--while we admire his spunk and resourcefulness (both unrealistic for easy laughs). The picture looks immaculate, sparkly and shined to a fare-thee-well. Often times, just the reassurance that what we're watching is a big, expensive bauble made solely for our enjoyment is enough to keep the masses happy. The holiday trimmings trigger nostalgia in adults and joy for children, while the thieves (Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern, both over-the-top) aren't scary, mean or nasty--just lovable, irascible losers who can't topple our pint-sized hero no matter how hard they try...and oh how the audience wants them to keep trying! Followed by two sequels in 1992 and 1997. ** from ****",0,0,0,0,-999,0,-999
Home Alone,"The first time I saw this film was when I was a child and it pleased me a lot because I only saw its comic side. I saw it recently and it disappointed me although the story is original: during Christmas holidays, the McCallister family decided to celebrate Christmas at Paris, unfortunately they forgot one of their children. First of all, Kevin is elated but he realizes that two thieves want to burgle his house. In order to get rid of them, he puts in several traps; the thieves are under arrested and Kevin finds again his family. If I had to choose one adjective to judge this film, it would be the term: conventional. Several sides of the film are showing it. For example, Kevin's family seem to ignore and despise him and consequently he feels rejected and outraged and ,at the end, his family and especially his mother discovers how much she loves him, moreover, they say that Kevin's neighbour is a killer and he's got a wicked reputation but Kevin finds out that he's not a murderer and he had an unhappy life. Not only is the film conventional but the screenplay is sometimes predictable : when Kevin finds out that is ""home alone"" he wants to have fun as much as he can, and finer feelings are often put forward . Nevertheless, Daniel Stern and Joe Pesci, the two thieves are very entertaining and the sequence where they have to endure Kevin's traps is very funny. At last, I think that this film was especially made for children and young teenagers and it was useless to make it follow by two poor sequels.",0,0,0,-999,-999,0,-999
Home Alone,"This type of family comedy truthfully works better if you are grown up with the stooges. Because this film has a climactic scene with more slapstick than most can take. I can though. But if you think this is strictly a kids film, parents will like it too I bet. The plot follows a kid (Macaulay Kulkin) who gets left behind in a Chicago suburb while his family leaves for Paris. And though the house is all his, 2 burglars (Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern who give the best on-screen duo of 1990) want the house. But not without the climax. While most of the film is unbelievable (both good and bad), most of the film should keep families in good spirits, unless parents don't enjoy seeing Pesci getting his head on fire and Stern screaming like a girl. Funny, even if it's not John Hughes' (writer/producer here) best. B+",0,-999,0,-999,-999,-999,-999
Home Alone,"A little boy ends up ""Home Alone"" when his family leaves for Paris without him in this 1990 film starring Macauley Culkin, Catherine O'Hara, Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern. The family is running late and nearly misses a flight to Paris; a neighbor boy gets into their van, so when the oldest girl does a head count, all are accounted for. Except that little Kevin (Culkin), who was sent to bed early and wishes his family would disappear, isn't there. It's not until they're on the plane that his mother (O'Hara) realizes that Kevin is missing. While she attempts to get back to him, Kevin needs to fend for himself and also protect himself from two robbers (Pesci and Stern) who are systematically robbing the neighbors and have Kevin's house targeted.Very funny, often laugh out loud film with Culkin pulling all kinds of pranks to keep the criminals out, from making it look like he's not alone by queuing up video tapes of crime films and setting booby traps should they break in. He also takes the time to talk to a mysterious neighbor (Roberts Blossom) who is estranged from his son. Mom, meanwhile, ends up in a movers truck with John Candy.Culkin is adorable without being cloying, and the movie has a wonderful warmth about it as well.

Complicating matters, the Christmas holiday makes it difficult to get back home.The next door neighbor, an elderly gentleman, is regarded as an eerie individual. Only our young lad talks to him in church and gets him to try to contact his long-estranged son.

Home Alone,"Home Alone is a Christmas family comedy about a young boy named Kevin, who is accidentally left behind when his family takes off for a vacation in France over the holiday season.It stars Macaulay Culkin together with Daniel Stern and Joe Pesci. It was written and produced by John Hughes and directed by Chris Columbus. Kevin McCallister is mistakenly left behind when his family flies to Paris for their Christmas vacation. He initially relishes being home alone, but soon has to contend with two would-be burglars who are planning to rob every house in Kevin's suburban Chicago neighborhood. Eventually,Kevin tries to contend with the burglars on his own in this slapstick comedy.The film was the highest grossing comedy when it was theatrically released.It definitely provided a lot of joy,humor and entertainment.There was also no dull and boring moment.The cast did a marvelous job in their respective roles.While the movie at present as this review is being written may find this film somewhat overstretched as a comedy by today's standards,it will always be a good family entertainment.",1,1,0,0,0,1,0
Home Alone,"Home Alone will stand the test of time, methinks. Watching it tonight, I just find it too much fun. Culkin is certainly a bona fide star here, the groundwork laid in his wonderful work opposite John Candy in the John Hughes-directed, Uncle Buck. The plot—as if you didn't know it, right?—has 8-year old Culkin (quite wise beyond his years, if a bit precocious and, at times, mischievous) left accidentally alone while his parents and family go to Paris by plane to visit the father's brother for the Christmas Holidays. He must fend off two cartoonish, oafish burglars (calling themselves the ""wet bandits""!!!) robbing rich suburban houses on his block, their eyes mainly focused on thieving from his family's home. Pesci and Stern are positively hilarious as the not-so-bright thieves, winding up punished by Culkin's vast array of traps laid at the house they so desperately want to rob. There's a lot more to the film than just seeing the bandits fall prey to violent traps set by an intelligent kid; touched on is Culkin's loneliness without his family, dealing with a scary neighbor (Roberts Blossom, who is simply delightful) that has more to him than meets the eye, and a mother's devoted trip back home to her son. Of course, generations of fans will remember Culkin applying aftershave and shrieking and the ""Filthy Animal"" footage scaring both Stern and a pizza delivery boy.The visual silhouette trick where Culkin fools Pesci and Stern into believing there was a party taking place is brilliant. Terrific casting, with the likes of Catherine O'Hara and John Heard as the parents, and even the smaller parts (the aforementioned Blossom and John Candy as the leader of a Polka band who offers a rented van ride to O'Hara he and his traveling buddies use to get to a gig in Milwaukee, passing through Chicago on the way), only enhance the whole experience.While the Raison d'être might seem to be Culkin outsmarting dim-witted, numskull burglars—using violence from a Loony Tunes cartoon to do so—there's plenty more to enjoy here. Personally, I think Culkin as the anchor is one of the chief reasons this film remains so timeless and specialit's the perfect example of just-right casting.""This is my house. I have to defend it."" After building up some good will throughout, credibility does go out the window, but this final stand between Culkin and the bandits is so highly memorable, I think it's excusable. Plus, despite what we know would *really* happen if these two actually were shot by bb's from a bb gun, slip on purposely icy steps, get hit in the head with a crowbar, touch a doorknob heated extremely, stepped on a long nail, received an iron to the forehead, tripped (and landed on) hotwheels, get a blow torch flame to the top of the head (!!!), step barefoot first onto ornaments (Yikes!), and take a shot to the face by loaded paint cans(!), part of the fun is to suspend disbelief and take it all in stride. Stern's reaction to the spider (and the iron stamp on his face) is priceless. As is Pesci covered in feathers. Stern trying to hit the spider and instead crushing Pesci's chest only adds to the outrageousness of the final minutes.While I loved and anticipated the finale as a child, with all its Three Stooges violence, I think as an adult, the film prior to this leaves a great deal more of an impression. There's a lot of heart here, accompanying the pain of picking the wrong house to rob and the wrong kid to antagonize. After Blossom bops the bandits in the heads with an ice shovel, the film pretty much tells you it's only a movie. Culkin re-uniting with his parents is the heart-warming ending you could only expect; include especially Blossom re-uniting with his estranged son's family, and there's much to find beyond just two nitwits enduring bodily injury most normal folks would never recover from.",1,1,1,0,0,1,0
Home Alone,"The overwhelming success of 'Home Alone' (it spawned two sequels), is enough to guarantee that most people will love this story of a family that departs for Paris on the Christmas holidays, mistakenly leaving an eight-year old boy to fend for himself. And fend he does, when burglars threaten to break in unless he can rig enough booby-traps to keep them out.That's the simple plot in a nutshell. Macaulay Culkin seems to have no problem carrying most of the film with a wide variety of looks, gestures and expressions--but for my money it's Daniel Stern and Joe Pesci who get the main laughs as the bumbling burglars intent on outwitting the kid's traps.
Others in the cast don't have as much to do but do well enough by their roles, particularly Catherine O'Hara and John Heard as the parents who only discover on the plane that Kevin is missing. The laughs are steady, the color photography is great and the slight story is probably every boy's fantasy of what it might be like to be left home alone. Add to that the holiday flavor of Christmas and a pleasant musical score by John Williams and you have the makings of a classic.

Home Alone,"A heavily dysfunctional family are going away for the Christmas holidays. They accidentally leave 8 year old Kevin (the annoying Macauley Culkin) alone at home. Other than doing what a normal kid would do (go to a neighbor or call the police) he decides to stay at home all alone. Two burglars (Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern--both who deserve better) try to break in. Culkin manages to single-handedly set up elaborate bobby traps to stop them.What a violent sick piece of garbage! I caught this is a theatre back in 1990. I saw it after a long week at work and expected a mindless fun PG movie. I was horrified by what I got. For starters the story was impossible. Leaving behind an 8 year old kid by mistake??? Come on! Also the whole family is heavily dysfunctional and not at all funny. Culkin manages to set up elaborate traps and stuff that no 8 year old could ever do. When Pesci and Stern show up the movie goes from stupid and unbelievable to extremely violent. These poor guys repeatedly get burnt and hit repeatedly on the head and face again and again--and it's all played for laughs! I was sickened by the level of violence in this film. How did this get a PG rating???? Also violence against people is NOT funny. It got to the point that I was rooting for the burglars. Aside from all this it just simply isn't funny. Sick, stupid and unbelievable yes--but NOT funny.The acting is as bad as you'd expect. Culkin is annoying from the start. Not cute at all--you want the little brat to get it badly. Stern and Pesci do what they can with nothing roles. Still, I realize I'm not the audience for this. In the theatre I saw it with was full of families with their kids. During the violence all the adults sat there horrified while all the little kids were screaming (literally) with laughter. A few parents dragged their kids out of there--I wish I had joined them. This was (inexplicably) a huge hit and led to the thankfully brief career of Culkin. Avoid this like the plague and definitely do NOT let small kids see it. A 1.",-1,-1,-1,-999,-999,-1,-999
Home Alone,"Eight year old Kevin McCallister (Macaulay Culkin, in his appealing break through lead performance) is frustrated enough with his family to ""wish them away"". And he gets this wish, sort of, when the entire family - parents, siblings, aunt & uncle & cousins included - is in such a rush to get to the airport in time for a trip to Paris that they leave him behind. At first, he has great fun with his temporary freedom and independence, but will eventually have to save his house from being burgled by a bumbling pair of oafs, Harry and Marv, played by Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern. This he does by staging an elaborate series of booby traps.""Home Alone"" is a pretty charming little family comedy that does have quite a bit of heart to go along with all of the farce and slapstick. This material is indeed pretty funny, with Pesci and Stern playing their slow witted lowlife criminals for all that they're worth; some of their facial expressions and reactions are just hysterical. Some of it may be a bit much, and may not jibe that well with the more serious portions of the movie, but it's doubtful many kids watching are going to care that much.It does, in the end, make a very good case for the need for family, how we're perfectly capable of taking our loved ones for granted, how to deal with one's fears and do some growing up, and in the case of Old Man Marley (the excellent veteran Roberts Blossom), how it's never too late to mend relationships. The wonderful scene between Culkin and Blossom in the church where they make a connection is indeed the best moment in the entire picture. Kevin's been administered (erroneous) warnings about the old man's supposedly sordid past, and is understandably afraid of him, and realizes how one shouldn't be too quick to believe that sort of thing.Lovely funny woman Catherine O'Hara also does extremely well in the role of the mother willing to do anything that's humanly possible in order to atone for what she feels is an unforgivably stupid mistake. It's truly a treat to see her reunited with 'SCTV' co-star John Candy, who's as engaging as ever in his cameo role as polka star Gus Polinski. John Williams supplies an expectantly catchy score and touching song (both Oscar nominated, with song lyrics by Leslie Bricusse).Good fun overall, with a bright wrap- up, it's not surprising that the movie would have been such an enormous hit over 20 years ago, and it continues to entertain today.Seven out of 10.",1,1,0,-999,1,0,-999

Home Alone,"Mediocre attempt at a comedy. Will probably appeal to kids but not to anyone else.Fairly basic, slapsticky plot. Some of the methods the kid uses to protect his home are quite clever, but that's about the only positive aspect of this movie.What an irritating kid. The back-chatty replies to his parents, the general cockiness. Can see why kids would like this, and why adults shouldn't...Unfortunately, it spawned several sequels, and launched the career of Macaulay Culkin...",-1,-999,-1,-999,-999,-999,-999
The Stand,"Well, we just got one episode but this doesn't look too good; it seems to me that people - especially - in the movie business (like in other fields of media) are not chosen by their talent and skill but by other criteria. Alone the idea of jumping back and forth in the timeline is one big let-down that destroys anything that could be called story or suspense. Production, cast and everything else is nothing special but rather pretty mediocre and standard. Well, Mr. King must live with the fact that many adaptions of his work on screen do not work well. To sum it up: very disappointing. My recommendation: read the book again or watch the mini-series from 1994.",-1,-1,-1,-999,-999,-1,-999
The Stand,"Quentin Tarantino annoys people but he did change the way practically everything is done in Hollywood, from movies to, especially now, binging television from LOST to Breaking Bad, having flashbacks that aren't really flashbacks and the whole nonlinear thing tell the story...And now it's hit The Stand, which is no surprise because the whole Binge-watching experience has this approach. This version is more for ""Fan-Geeks of The Stand who have everything"" as a Christmas present (I realize this only came out on Christmas because of our REAL pandemic)...Even with the nonlinear this series doesn't not, so far, compared to the original miniseries King wrote himself, and that, while a bit corny at times, is still quite good, and you can watch it again and again.Bottom line: This feels more like a Stand television series than a miniseries. Or limited series I guess is what they call miniseries's now. And like the remake of Total Recall, Footloose and so many others, it will just be forgotten in less than a year.",0,-999,-999,-999,-999,-999,-999
The Stand,"I've read The Stand so many times I've lost count, just watched episode 1 and it stinks. Whose Idea was it to jump around all over the book, starting near the end, close to the beginning and then all over the place ? Whoppi Goldberg ? Owen Teague is excellent but why am I feeling sorry for Harold and why is Frannie Goldsmith so abrasive and stuck up ? And why is this boring me ? I believe this began filming before Covid, but whether it's appropriate or not for the times isn't as big a question as why this program is so poorly done and so horribly written and cast. Will it ever be possible to make a great movie from The Stand ? this sure isn't it.",-1,-1,-1,-999,-999,-1,-999
The Stand,"Cause otherwise it would be in very poor taste to launch it now. Even for King. But I guess it is. We see the disorieted characters before the pandemic, lost in their ways. The horrific pandemic being taken too lightly by these naive morons. Then reality hits. Pure Horror. Heads exploding. Society wiped out, they must realize that the old ways are no longer sustainable. They see the mesianic Mme Goldberg in their dreams. I guess she is kind of a George Soros/Bill Gates figure. The Safe State. Taking care of the grown infants of the West. New families are created by ""free"" association of survivors to create a great multi racial group of ""immunes"", representing the Globalist Village dream. The Great Reset realized.

The Stand,"I just can't for the life of me understand why they thought it was a good idea to start the story in medias res and tell it via flashbacks. I very rarely review shows/films I didn't like (it's just not interesting to me) but this unnecessary approach to one of my favorite stories irks me so much I just have to get the frustration out of my system - so please excuse me for ranting.Why - just why? The Stand is a tale about an epic - linear - journey the same way The Lord Of The Rings is: or would you have thought it clever to introduce Legolas, Aragon and Gandalf when they stroll around in Minas Tirith shortly before their final battle against Sauron and then tell the audience via flashbacks how they got there?The most intriguing aspect of the story told in The Stand is following the characters from the relative normalcy of their lives before the virus strikes to the at first slow but then quickly accelerating unraveling of society until total meltdown happens and the protagonists eventually head into literal Armageddon.It's an epic journey; witnessing it from the beginning to the end in chronological order is the whole point. It's also how the characters' arcs are set up: they're on a journey too, in more than one way; as their world transforms, they do too. A flashback structure very much defeats the purpose of the whole premise and sucks every ounce of tension out of the narrative.I get that there are books that are very hard to adapt without changing the structure, but The Stand is decidedly not one of those. In fact, most of King's novels offer the perfect narrative structure for a direct adaptation into a film or mini series, and if you look at the best films based on his works - Stand By Me, The Shawshank Redemption, The Green Mile, Misery and The Mist - they all tell straight-forward, linear stories the way King put them on the page.So come on, it's not rocket science: just follow the book! Rant over.",-1,-999,-1,-999,-999,-999,-999
The Stand,I expected a lot more from this show though the start was just awful dont know what every director thinks they are a Tarrantino and think that they can master flash backs...just show us a story form the start and build up to the present. This has the look of a Syfy channel show and violence and foul language wont save it.This show will BOMB!,-1,-999,-1,-1,-999,-999,-999
The Stand,"This new adaptation of The Stand was something I was really looking forward to but I haven't been let down this badly since the last season of Game of Thrones.Something went seriously wrong with this production and whoever greenlight the badly misjudged decision to mess about with the running order of the story, should seriously be fired from their job. It just doesn't work and just because it's a cool trend right now, doesn't mean you should try be like bloody West World. I mean who decided this? Have you even read the book? Do you understand how storytelling works? Stop embracing a trend which kills all tension and eliminates any chance of character development or emotional connections with your viewing audience.Now look, off the bat, I enjoyed the ABC 1994 version, it was a decent adaptation for the time, a bit cheesy sure, but it was fun and had good casting with characters who had solid arcs and it was enjoyable and at least watchable, but it was, as others have rightly said, very much of its time in terms of tone, style and content. A more up to date remake was most welcome, even timely considering the subject matter.The plot follows various American characters as an unknown virus wipes out 95% of the human race while the remaining others are immune. The survivors gravitate towards two opposing forces - one side led by Mother Abigail (the force of good and cool hair) or Randall Flag (The force of bad, but with more drugs and swingers parties taken to eleven) and eventually things are set for a showdown between them. Good vs Evil, lots of religious symbolism, none of which I have an issue with. Mixed in with this are the lives of various characters on both sides of the equation some of whom cross from one side to the other.This new non linear approach to the story is a classic example of: if it isn't broke don't try and fix it. None of the changes that deviate from the narrative of the book work here and the casting all feels off for some reason. Listen there's some good actors in this thing, but the tone, pace and story all fail because of the disjointed narrative and the constant jumping around of timelines destroys any chance of you becoming really invested in any of them. Some of the most important progression dramatic beats and character arcs are completely lost here and it just doesn't work, at all, on any level. So many roles feel so miscast and the actors performances don't really gel nor have any emotive impact because we don't feel nor see a sense of progression. One moment we're in the past, then present, then the future, then back somewhere else, by which time I was wishing for Gary Sinse and Rob Lowe to turn up from the original.The production design feels off too. Yeah dream sequences, can feel weird and out of place, but some of the actual scenes do too. Either one person was given too much power on this show and no one though to rein them in or it was the extremely opposite and it was too many cooks or pulling the narrative and design all over the place. the entire production lacks a cohesive vision. I mean you can literally hear the Producer meetings 'Oh we should this with the timeline, it worked so well in that other show... people will love it."" Well I've got news for you. Stephen King has been around a long long time, and his fanbase were brought up on productions like Salems Lot and Christine, which followed traditional storytelling modus operandi and you know what - it worked.This doesn't. What a colossal waste of talent. There's some good performances here but I honestly will not be tuning in for the future episodes, you lost me on episode. Massively disappointing.",-1,-1,-1,-1,-999,-1,-999
The Stand,"A testament to the greed and shamelessness of Hollywood and its stars. What new lows they'll grovel to just to make yet another buck. The adaptation of the book is horrid but when is King NOT horrid? He's not much of a writer--he's a describer of horror. His forte is blood and guts--not a psychological master like E.A. Poe at all. I'm beginning to believe that Stephen was either a severely abused child or was born with Aspergers, sociopathy, psychopathy or all three! His life and mind have both reflected dementia.As far as this series, all the actors deserve to get COVID.",-1,-1,-999,-999,-999,-1,-999

Give this film the dark cinematography it deserves .

Despite it being very dated.So, here is what it all comes down to Constant Viewers, as per SK's own works in ""on Writing"" you are better off saying ""he takes the hammer and bashes it over..."" rather than ""he grabbed the hammer and bashed it.."" the latter is in the past. it lacks immediacy, intensity.

The Stand,"The Stand, a seminal work by author Stephen King, has been attempted once again, this time from the network responsible for the destruction of the iconic Star Trek franchise. I am not a person who believes that a series or movie based on a previous has to be 100% like the book, by definition, adaptations are versions of books. However, and call me crazy, I feel that if you're going to make a series called The Stand, based on the book, then it should have at least some elements of the story. CBS Access' The Stand is The Stand in name only. If the series were at least well crafted or engaging in some way then I could defend it, but this is yet another title from CBS AA that exists for display purposes only. I hate everything about this.",-1,-999,-999,-999,-999,-999,-999
The Stand,"I've tried to go into this with amnesia of the original. I really tried... But they kept poking the bear of nostalgia and this review is the result.Too OTT in bits, not nearly dramatic enough in others. Half of the actors look like they fell off of the acting tree, hit every branch and then landed on a wet Oscar made of tin.I've since rewatched and whilst I still feel it has it's merits, the scattergun approach of chopping up the scenes is far too rushed here. They've tried to go for a Nolan/Lynch crossover here, but it falls flat on both accounts.Not sure why Captain Trips is turning people into people from Star Wars, but there you have it. Don't know why it kills exactly, except someone saying you choke on your own phlegm. That said, they've looked at the effects of the 1994 version and decided to go Walking Dead and at times, these such scenes (one in particular) look like content people have put up with Instagram/Facebook masks.Not sure what the need was to make time play out like someone just had Christopher Nolan-shaped diarrhoea, but there you have it. Whoever said to shoot a slow walking guy and add in a whistling Twin Peaksy overture, instead of just having him whistle himself is beyond me. Sure, it could signify him whistling, but it's the little things like that which make a difference. It's one of the reasons Jamey Sheridan had immediate effect on screen in the original.Not really sure of the timing of the release, I suspect this was rushed out more than kept back if I'm honest. Could have perhaps waited until after this pandemic at least has a vaccine roll-out, but there you have it.Then there's Stu... I forget his name, I think he's a Hemsworth, I can't be bothered to check, but I've seen him in a few things before. He acts like he's just about to climb up your nose, make his way to your genitals, and dance like Kevin Bacon. He's an odd one and an odd choice for such a featured character. I don't know about anyone else, but Stu seemed to have shrewd morals and be quite sharply spoken. Maybe that's Gary Sinise, but this production seems to have given him a shave... literally. Within the first episode, I have no idea of who he really is and whilst they're obviously dragging that story arc out, he really should have been directed/written better.For example:A doctor comes in and tries to manipulate Stu into helping out more and this Stu can't put 1-and-2 together that Campion was obviously military, so this could be homemade? Therefore, it is not curious to wonder that this guy might have duplicitous reasoning, and the fact he's using your dead wife's legacy to guilt you into giving as much blood as you can to help the rest? Oh okay then, go on, my dead wife will be proud - sorry, no matter if you're the good guy or not, which is what this is all about I guess, there would and should be more conflict there.The original was a bit like four TV films. They were to a degree in fact - they came on tapes. It was a slog to watch, but worth it. This however is a totally different model and while it's trying to walk it's own path, it is obviously been made with fans in mind, but to the point of shortcutting? Like, you'd HAVE to watch the original Stand to get this. Or you'd have to read the book to get this - it's a little too meandering in aspects and unless they're planning a lot of tidying up in the concurrent episodes, that was a bit messy for a pilot. Why they didn't just set-up like the original is beyond me - you didn't have to remake it, but it is like they've had to film it in segements because of COVID. I get that, but for a pilot for what could be such a good serial, that was a bit weak if I'm honest.You can dance about all you want, but this is worth a watch because it is such a good story at-heart. If you are reading this review to gauge if you should watch this or the original, watch both. This isn't as bad as some are making out and I feel that there's quite a lot of pandemic-related emotion here... which I get, to a degree. I even get the eggheads who have cited Amber Heard as being a drag - except, she hasn't been in it yet, so don't **** the bed just yet.Good to see X-Files bad guy Krychek getting a cheque, and I could have sworn I head Bryan Cranston as the POTUS, but it seems he just sounds like him.I recently re-edited this and dropped a point because of the atrocious credits. If you watch this, skip the credits, they're pants. Also, they've tried to Greedo Stu a bit. How the fight scene plays out is a bit dicey to be honest and sorry, but the 90s version has a one-up on you there. Simplicity is the best. Don't try to humanise Stu too much - the reason Sinise worked was because of his rough southern charm, but brittle and coarse attitude. So another one off from me there.I'm sure this review will change over time and there's just one other thing... Harold Lauder? The lad can act, sure, but... if I'm tuning back in, it because I want to see his character die. He's essentially the protagonist of the pilot to a degree and to go out on a limb here... The reason the acting is a little off in this is because the actors know they're essentially rebranding a previously branded character. We'll see I guess, but the acting is just odd at times and J.K Simmons? Really? You had a talent such as he and you used him for all of one scene? Maybe he'll come up in a series of afterthoughts through some mad plot device in later episodes, but if that's the end of his character's arc in this series, you need your head examining.It's like... It's a bit like IT? In more ways than one. It is as if the actors and writers have watched the originals, and more or less gone with bipolar opposites in many respects (from a character perspective). It's truly odd writing, but I will be tuning in next week to see more and you know... this is in fact worth your time. You're only going to be sitting there worrying about COVID-19 anyhow, but on that note, on a serious note - if you've been touched by Covid-19 or someone in your family has, this mightn't be the thing to watch. It has one or two scenes that are a bit too Hollywood in honesty and could be a little insensitive at this time.But the social distancing is terrible in this and no-one really wears masks. If you're going to make a film about a pandemic, at least act like one.5/10 - and that's because it has merits and Skarsgard could actually hit it out of the park as he's a genuinely great actor and I'm tuning in to see his take on Flagg. I only hope he doesn't go at it with a palette knife.",-1,-1,-1,-999,-999,-1,-999

The Flight Attendant,"""The Flight Attendant"" is not a must-see, but if you do end up seeing it you'll probably have a good time. It is very derivative: from the core concept of the innocent (wo)man being ""in the wrong place at the wrong time"" to a character having conversations with someone who exists only inside their head, there is virtually nothing in this series that hasn't been done many times before (and even many years before). The first few episodes are fast, then the show gets sidetracked by secondary stories which add little, but the finale is reasonably tense and satisfying - maybe too much so (there is at least one character who shouldn't really be alive that somehow makes it). If you don't guess who ""Felix"" is before it is revealed, this is probably your first mystery show....Impressive performances by Kaley Cuoco, who runs the gamut of emotions (this is certainly leagues ahead of her work in ""Big Bang Theory""), and the fabulous Michelle Gomez, wonderful animated opening credits sequence (which I always played twice before the start of each episode). None-too-demanding entertainment. Now, a great show would have Cuoco - SPOILER - responsible for the murder after all!

The Flight Attendant,"The new ""HBO Max"" series ""The Flight Attendant"" is one dark catchy drama like series that in many episodes things seem a little delayed or grounded yet with each character and flashback like scenes things are revealed with twist and turns nothing seems the same! For years many enjoyed Kaley Cuoco as a bright sweetheart on the hit comedy ""The Big Bang Theory"" now Kaley has traveled and took to the skies of the drama world and she proves her worth and growth as an actress.Kaley is Cassie Bowden a boozy hard partying hard drinking colored bra wearing girl who loves her job as a flight attendant. Things get thrown for a spin and turn when on one of her international travels Cassie wakes up in a Bangkok hotel room next to a dead man(Alex) after a one night stand. From then on this series twist with panic, drama, and secrets, as no one is who they seem to be. And thru the FBI investigation things are revealed like that of a complicated underworld. This world has little things like money laundering, corruption, murder, and even organized crime. Also we see that Cassie is a tortured soul as thru flashbacks it's revealed things and demons from her childhood will not leave. The use of split screen shots only add to the fast paced dark humor feel of the series.Good wild card and supporting turns are given from Cassie's lawyer Annie(Zosia Mamet) and her co worker the shady and secretive like co flight attendant Megan(Rosie Perez) as things come to light with these characters also that tie into the mystery and drama of the series story. As with each episode and plot reveals you ask who can you trust and you wonder about the new evidence that's been discovered. Really none of these characters are traveling alone as they all appear to be grounded and delayed in a sticky web and puzzle like maze of questions with answers and truths waiting to land.

The Flight Attendant,"She is still clumsy, promiscuous and a drunk! So, this role had her name written all over it 🤣 I watched the 3 episodes to date and I must say, Kaley Cuoco is an amazing actress - wow! Sure many of you may get mad my calling her Penny, but it's hard to let go of her career-making character, especially in being a similar character. But this time, it's not aloof acting, but intense dramatics, and she has pulled it off. The entire casting is actually great, and it's great to see Rosie Perez back on the tube. Novice creator Steve Yockey who wrote and produced the Supernatural and Scream TV series, managed to put together this genre-melding hot-mess whodunit comical drama with - so far, great success. It's sexy, tense, darkly funny, trippy, twisty, weird, fun, entertaining and a crazy ride, that without Cuoco's career-best performance, may have not worked. It certainly is something refreshingly new in the subscription TV-show battles. I hope the writers and directors can maintain the excitement in the upcoming episodes.

The Flight Attendant,"Only saw the first 3 episodes (all currently released on HBO Max), and this is definitely how good TV is done. I don't particularly like TV series (I'm more of a movie guy), and this is still very watchable (it's movie-quality TV, IMO).The only part I thought was overly fake was when the lawyer's boyfriend hacks into the company to get information for her (HBO needs to learn to get hacking in movies and TV right -- they always seem to think it's so easy. You can't just hack into whatever you want, whenever you want.

There was Eight Simple Rules For Dating My Teenage Daughter where she played opposite John Ritter until his untimely death and the last gasp of the OG Charmed where she played the ""likeable"" sister of the last evil duo the Charmed Ones went up against. She also did some VO work after BBT.

She is also a hard core alcoholic. and party girl who has a tendency to both black out and wake up in strange places. So when she wakes up in a foreign country in someone elses hotel room and someone elses bed next to a dead man she panics and does the exact wrong thing and cleans up the scene and escapes back to the United States and then lies to the FBI waiting for her. From there she does increasinly crazy and manic things to try to figure out who killed the man she picked up on her flight as the pieces of her childhood come back to haunt her.It is a fun mystery and although HBO Max is releasing it two episodes at a time it is a great show to binge.

Rarely seen so many awkward actors trying to act, the only ""comical"" moment came after the 1st episode finished with a preview of a future episode, a scene with a flying shoe.
Hopefully now the awkward unfunny snoozefest pilot episode is over there might actually be some comedy within the coming episodes, as a pilot episode is meant to grab the viewer so they continue to watch further episodes this failed on all levels, the only reason I'm interested in watching the next episode is for the ""flying shoe"" & hoping there's a few more scenes with at least that level of comedy.
Kaley Cuoco has shown with Big Bang she's a good actor & it's nice to see she's playing something other than the dumb blonde bimbo, an intelligent dumb blonde slapper, oh well, it's progress, possibly.
Hopefully this will do well if they get the comedy right, it's got some interesting quirky aspects to it, the awkwardly shoehorned flashbacks of what seems to be child molestation may be ""character developement"" but seems unnecessary given there's already a murder mystery to unravel.

The Flight Attendant,"The Big Bang Theory alum Kaley Cuoco stars in the HBO Max mini-series ""The Flight Attendant."" It revolves around the main protagonist Cassandra Bowen, an alcoholic, promiscuous flight attendant, who wakes up next to a dead body in Bangkok. After this revelation, things take a drastic and often dark turn for the character, who starts to experience PTSD about a tragic event from her past.The premiere episode tackled the overarching plot head on and managed to grip the viewer and to get invested in the main character's arc. I loved the opening montage of the series where different snippets of a flight attendants' life are shown. It does not always showcase their life realistically, but it was still fun to see.The whole series was shot on location and it completely benefits from it. It was shot in Bangkok, Rome and New York. As a person who visited all three cities, I absolutely adored revisiting them in a fictional setting. What struck me as astonishing was the soundtrack of the series, especially during the opening and end credits of each episode. Plus, the animation during the opening credits was a nice touch and gives off a vibrant feeling.The revelation that Cassandra's on again off again beau Felix Buckley is actually a highly skilled assassin was extremely surprising and caught me off guard. This is just one example of the handful of twists and turns the series has in store for the viewer.Perhaps the only complaint I had with the mini-series is that often times it felt convoluted and quite confusing. For instance, the flashbacks could have been handled better. It did not feel like it was timed perfectly. Furthermore, the scenes that took place in Cassandra Bowen's mind felt a little rushed and superfluous. These scenes hindered some episodes from moving the storyline forward and in an eloquent and cohesive manner.To conclude, ""The Flight Attendant"" is a thrill ride from beginning to end and proves further how versatile Kaley Cuoco is. She steps out of the Big Bang Theory character Penny's shadow and manages to give the audience a fresh, new look at her acting filmography. The series is witty, tense and emotional, and will leave you speechless and in a precarious state after every episode.Final verdict: 8.8/10",1,1,0,0,1,1,0
The Flight Attendant,"The show is quite enjoyable and the acting is decent, but there are a few cons.
Kaley Cuoco is exactly the same character that she was on Big Bang Theory, but why?

If the show producers bothered that much, they could make her a serious high ranking office manager with black hair and glasses, which hangs out in a bar nearby after work,but they didn't, they wanted her character to be this light messy blond with unsorted life ...
So all in all, the best way to watch it as a sequel of Big Bang Theory where Penny gets into trouble... Another thing to mention - annoying flashbacks, it's way too many of them and they get in the way of the main story too often...

Unlike other films this one actually becomes better with repeated viewings--and it's great to see and hear the wonderful and silly lines again--especially when they are are friends and family there to see it and laugh along with you. Perfect writing (albeit, very, very cynical), wonderful acting, great attention to details (the 1940s look to the film is great--down to the boxes of soap and radio programs) and so many funny and sentimental moments make this a perennial favorite.

A Christmas Story,"What a wonderful movie! I didn't realise Bob Clark had a movie in him like this. In fact I had to double check that it was Bob Clark who directed this, because while Black Christmas was good, he also did the atrocious Baby Geniuses movies and the lacklustre Rhinestone. Here in A Christmas Story though, this is not only the best I've seen Clark direct but I think it is his best film too.I love Christmas movies, and while A Christmas Story is not my absolute favourite, I think it fully deserves its title as timeless Christmas treasure. The film looks great with the cinematography skillful and the locations striking. The script is always witty and insightful, I loved the home truths and the lack of smut and saccharin which may have marred the film slightly if included. The story is beautifully structured and an enormous joy all the same. The pace was spot on too, while the entire cast performed impeccably.In fact, everything I have to say about A Christmas Story is good.

A Christmas Story,"Though Peter Billingsley has grown up and now has a career behind the camera in the business end of show business he will forever be remembered as young Ralphie in A Christmas Story. For those who were young and listened to Jean Shepherd's program as a kid he can do nothing else.I remember turning and listening to Jean Shepherd as an adolescent and I even turned my younger brother into a fan and being he was a precocious lad it very much appealed to him as well. All the incidents you see in A Christmas Story culminating with young Ralphie getting that wondrous gift of a Red Ryder BB rifle are those I remember Shepherd telling on his show. I daresay they made that vivid an impression on thousands of others. Getting Shepherd to not only write the screenplay, but narrate is essential to the story.This all takes place in Jean Shepherd's home town of Hammond, Indiana, steel town and suburb of both Chicago and Gary. The Parkers consist of Melinda Dillon mother and Darren McGavin father and Billingsley with younger brother Ian Petrella. McGavin who thought he'd be best remembered for being Mike Hammer and Carl Kolchak on television got his career. Shepherd on his show always referred to his father as ""the old man"" and so he remains here. McGavin is absolutely perfect in the way that Shepherd described him on his radio show.Billingsley and Petrella are appealing as real kids and not Hollywood type kids. Again I'm sure there was a lot of input from Shepherd in those characterizations as well.For me you'll love that scene when the boys meet Santa Claus at the department store. Seen through a kid's eyes it's both humorous and a bit frightening as well.In fact A Christmas Story is a holiday classic and will be for centuries.",1,1,1,0,0,1,0
A Christmas Story,"Christmas Story, A (1983) **** (out of 4) This is one of those somewhat legendary movies that I never got around to watching even though it plays on television a couple hundred times a year and has been since I was a little kid. It's a shame I waited until director Bob Clark's recent death to finally view it but I'm certainly glad I did. I'm sure everyone knows the story so there's no point of me going into that. The four-star rating is certainly being kind since the film has several flaws but who cares? I thought the film had so many great moments that I can easily overlook the flaws and add this to one of my holiday favorites. I think what I loved most is the nostalgia factor Clark uses, which is pretty remarkable. The film has a nostalgic look and feel, which makes it hard to believe that the film was made in 1983. It has brought back many nostalgic moments for me because Clark did a terrific job in making the viewer identify with the kid and his various thoughts and feeling about Christmas. The fantasy sequences were brilliantly done as was the Christmas morning stuff. The ending with Ralphie in bed holding his gun was certainly something a true beauty and the way Clark shows off his happiness was quite touching. Melinda Dillon, Darren McGavin and Peter Billingsley are all wonderful in their roles. The film is full of such small, genuine moments that it's easy to see why it's so loved after all these years. It could be the school bully, Santa's mean elves or sticking your tongue on a frozen pole. Another great thing was the laughing done by the cast. I can't recall a movie that has more genuine laughs coming from the characters, which just warms you up when heard.",1,1,1,1,0,1,0
A Christmas Story,"When I saw A Christmas Story repeatedly described as the 'best Christmas film ever', I knew I'd be invariably disappointed. This sweet and sentimental story is a family-focused tale about a young boy growing up in the 1940s and desperate for a toy gun for Christmas. Yep, the usual American preoccupation with commercialism, and not a patch on the likes of IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE.It is, however, the sort of film that kids would love, given that it charts children getting up to repeated mischief in much the same way as Richmal Crompton's JUST WILLIAM books. I can imagine that it's the type of film that people would watch themselves as a kid in the 1980s and grow up loving it with a fuzzy feeling of nostalgic warmth, which is fair enough.The twist about A Christmas Story is that it's actually a Canadian film, directed by the one and only Bob Clark, whose Black Christmas is one of the ultimate Christmas horror films ever made. As for this film, it's watchable and fitfully amusing, featuring the usual pratfalls and scenes of kids getting their tongues stuck to frozen poles. The main character is a bit annoying although not as much as I'd feared and old-timer Darren McGavin helps to anchor things as his dad.

This is an idealized nostalgic look at middle America. Ralphie is not particularly heroic. He's self-centered. He's the every boy. That's why we love him. He just wants his BB gun. And how can we not love that face.There are many laughs to be had in this movie. But it always starts with licking the frozen pole. Every year, it is a gut wrenching laugh. It never gets old. Flick (Scott Schwartz) is hilarious. Just thinking about him screaming makes me laugh. The other can't-stop-laughing moment has to be the creepy Santa and his irate Elves.

A Christmas Story,"I have been a fan of Jean Shepherd for a long time. I had found a copy of ""Wanda Hickey's Night of Golden Memories"" in a used book store many years ago. Those stories spoke to me. They were about children in a small Midwestern town. They were exaggerated portrayals of the good guys and bad guys of everyday life. I went to this movie and sat down with a theater filled with seven and eight year olds and their tired, Christmas weary parents. One man used the expression which he said pretty much to himself: ""Why do you drag me to this kind of crap?"" As the movie unfolded, the naysayers began to giggle, then to laugh, and then to cry. This movie has a remarkable connection with anyone who has ever had an irrational but loving father, a kind, patient mother, and an existence slightly above the poverty level. I remember one of my chores in my junior hight years was to carry a five gallon can of fuel oil ten blocks so that we would have heat for another day. I never thought much of it. The anticipation of Christmas and all that it entailed was so important. We were generally disappointed, but there really was an excitement in the air. That anticipation that you were going to get the special thing. The scheming, the conniving, the butt kissing, that went into setting the table for Christmas day was really there. And we had those traditions, just like Ralphie. The tree, the shopping, seeing Santa, even though I knew he was the guy from the Ford dealership. I still love Christmas.As for the movie, it has so many individual delights: the flag pole, the flat tire, the lamp, the Santa Claus at the department and those hideous helpers, Scut Farkas and his yellow teeth, the Bumpus family and those horrible dogs. It's a treasure that everyone gets to partake in each year. I love it.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
A Christmas Story,"So goes the lyrics to a big production number in the stage musical version of this Christmas classic, transferred so successfully that it became the first limited Christmas Broadway show to get a Tony Nomination for Best Musical. Re-visiting that show again for its Madison Square Garden engagement, I reflected on the movie which has become a Christmas perennial, showed repeatedly on cable stations every December, sometimes as long as 24 hours without going to another program! Growing up in a small town in New York in the mid 1970's where Christmas was celebrated in the old fashioned sense, I could relate to every aspect of this film which took place some 20 years before.Pretty much everyone can relate to that one present they desperately wished for when they were a child, even if it wasn't a red-ryder beebee gun. ""You'll shoot your eye out, kid!"", everybody tells him, and in the musical, there's even a huge production number where his fourth grade teacher Miss Shields sings and dances in red sequins after giving him the notorious C+. Miss Shields (Tedde Moore) doesn't sing and dance here, but she's still part of Robby's fantasies. Greeting the teacher with monster teeth attached to their own, the kids turn them in to which she adds these choppers to a collection of other trinkets she's taken away from children not paying attention to their lessons over the years. The story focuses on Ralphie's family, which includes Darren McGavin as the irritable father, Melinda Dillon as the sweet and understanding mother, and Ian Petrella as the adolescent Randy who is sort of mistreated comically as he eats mashed potatoes like a pig and is over-wrapped in winter clothes which make it impossible for him to keep his arms down. Ralphie is played by the adorable Peter Billingsley who went onto produce the stage musical version, and he truly is the dream version of the every day kid. Disciplined and polite (even if he does utter a curse word in one very funny scene), he is still a 9 year old in every sense of the word, prankish and funny, and cutely geeky. Jean Shepherd (the adult Ralphie) provides the witty narration, giving the viewer an inside look into what life was like in the mid west when tradition was everything.This film has so many wonderful moments, and even if I don't watch it every year (seeing the musical twice over the past two holiday seasons did it justice for me), I still look back on it fondly. Who hasn't experienced a nightmare visit to Santa in the local department store right before the holidays where nasty assistants and a possible inebriated fat man in a Santa suit hasn't hurried them along as the night rolls to an end? Who hasn't been humiliated by an obnoxious present by a well-meaning relative who thinks that a 9-year old would look cute in a pink bunny suit? Who hasn't wondered what it would be like to stick their tongue on something frozen? (I know that a certain member of my family actually did, and with much regret too...)Also memorable is the prize which McGavin receives from one of the many contests he's entered (nothing like a good old leg o' lamp...) and his constant fighting with the furnace, plus Dillon's reaction to the ""Chinese Turkey"" they receive when the downtrodden neighbor's dogs steal their own. Lots of subtle innuendos too about kids of this day, particularly one goggle-clad little boy in line to see Santa who declares to Ralphie, ""I like ""The Wizard of Oz"". I like the tin man!"" as Ralphie tells the woman in the wicked witch costume to beat it. While this film had a rather small theatrical release and appears to have been a sleeper of the time, it has certainly erupted into cult status, even providing an obscure sequel, ""It Runs in the Family"", once re-titled ""A Summer Story"" for VHS release. (That film is memorable for me for a sequence in which Mary Steenburgen as the mother tired of receiving a gravy boat at a local movie theater, started a riot by tossing her umpteenth one at the nervous host of the dish giveaway.)

At school, Ralphie's teacher Miss Shields (Tedde Moore) assigns the class to write a theme about what they want for Christmas, he naturally writes about the BB gun hoping for high praise, only to get a C+ and a note ""P.S. You'll shoot your eye out"". Ralphie's next plan is to ask Santa Claus (Jeff Gillen), well a guy in the suit, for the present he longs for, but he also says ""You'll shoot your eye out, kid"". Having enough of hearing this, he and Randy are on their way home, and when Scut and Grover Dill come up to them again, Ralphie punches the bully to the ground and constantly hits him until Mrs. Parker (Melinda Dillon) stops him, leaving a bloody face. Ralphie thinks he has no chance of getting his BB gun now, while The Old Man, Mr. Parker (Darren McGavin) has his treasured major award, a lamp shaped like a woman's leg, completely broken. So Christmas Day has arrived, The Old Man is trying to get his mitts on the turkey without success, everyone has got their presents, and Ralphie opens all of them, and is devastated not to have his BB gun. But then, his father points out an unopened present conspicuously placed, it is his beloved BB gun, and he goes outside to play with it immediately, only to do exactly what everyone said he would, shoot his eye out, well hit his face. He lies so he doesn't have his gun taken away, and after the turkey gets ruined by dogs coming in the family eat dinner in a Chinese restaurant, and the film ends with Ralphie sleeping happily with his gun in his arms. Also starring Scott Schwartz as Flick and R.D. Robb as Schwartz. This film is apparently an underrated look at what Christmas is like during childhood, but it featured in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, it is certainly one of the best children and family films for the festive period, a fun seasonal comedy.

A Christmas Story,"I don't remember the movie's original theatrical release, and came to know about it by a friend's recommendation, probably a year or two after it first came out. Though my own childhood occurred a decade after the setting for ""A Christmas Story"", there's no mistaking the angst of a nine year old's condition awaiting the hallowed day, wondering whether a favorite gift would be waiting under the tree. The appeal of the film is timeless in it's own way, and funny in it's depiction of the foibles of youth. At about Ralphie's age, my own son tested the integrity of the old tongue on the pole trick, fortunately to no serious outcome as the rest of the family was watching from inside the house during Christmas dessert. Grandpa to the rescue with a cup of warm water, thereby saving the fire department an inconvenient trip down the road.Attempting to answer the question of whether Santa Claus is real or not would probably have been too overt a theme for the picture, so the movie's take on the loss of youthful innocence is handled a bit differently. That Ovaltine scene when Ralphie deciphers the radio message with his Little Orphan Annie secret decoder pin is one of the best put downs ever of the season's crass commercialism.All of the story's little vignettes work in capturing the innocence and wonder of a simpler era, from standing up to the neighborhood bully to the 'shoot your eye out' mentality of over anxious mother hens with their precocious children. Somehow I managed to sidestep the taste testing effects of Lux, Palmolive and Lifebuoy, but most of the rest of the picture evoked the fond memories of a childhood growing up in a small town with the kind of issues faced by Ralphie and his buddies. I even remember a friend's first use of the 'F' word, mispronouncing it in an attempt to make it sound less vulgar and offensive than it was.Just recently, I read about the renovation and opening of the original Christmas Story house in downtown Cleveland where the movie was made. A separate museum across the street is home to memorabilia from the film, though the 'leg lamp' is prominently displayed in the window of the house as it appeared in the film. Funny how a film can change one's perception of things; I now always hear the word pronounced 'fra-gee-lay'.Of course, every Christmas now the movie is shown in marathon sessions on cable, this year TBS won the honors. Because it's been so easily accessible, I've disregarded it the last few years, but decided to watch it start to finish today in a burst of holiday nostalgia. Now if only I could get my hands on a Red Ryder carbine action two hundred shot range model air rifle.",1,0,1,0,0,0,0
A Christmas Story,"This movie gained classic status almost instantly. This wonderful story takes you back to a more simple time and brings back memories for both old and young. The most common things and events become urgently important and very memorable. Little 'Ralphie' Parker(Peter Billingsley) wants only one thing to make his Christmas the best ever. He has to convince his parents and Santa that a Red Ryder BB gun is a safe and practical gift.My favorite scenes are: when 'Ralphie' lets the ""f---"" word slip out and gets his mouth washed out with soap; also funny is the neighborhood dogs running through the house and destroying the cooked turkey; and out right hilarious is the trip to the Chinese restaurant for Christmas dinner, especially when the duck gets its head chopped off. There is so much more to enjoy through out this film. If you haven't seen this already, where have you been? Darren McGavin and Melinda Dillon play Ralphie's parents and are flawless.

A Christmas Story,"Spoilers herein.Something cannot be funny if it doesn't engage.Back before Garrison Keillor, we had Jean Shepherd telling us stories over the radio. There is no storytelling like that on the radio: with reading, you work with the writer to create worlds, but with radio the writer also acts as a tractor to pull you through those worlds. There is nothing at all like radio narrative: your imagination is unconstrained, but the shape of the narrative thread is wholly out of your control.Garrison's innovation is to interest by opportunistic rambles, where each threaded episode is unresolved and arbitrarily leads to another. This works because we are charmed with the randomness but not unsettled because the settings and characters recur as familiar touchstones. The comfort of the characters and puerile moral offsets the novel narrative construction.But before that, we had a greater craftsman who resembled this only in the episodic constructions. Shepherd's novelty was to ramble but instead of a focus on making the characters and situations familiar (though they were), he focused on the connections. These connections are unlike anything I have experienced in radio or film: they are the kind of switches in subject you make in daydreaming that you cannot retrace or logically understand but which you know constitute who you really are.This is abstract, which is essential for humor, but it is as intimately engaging as you can get, which is why it can be so damned funny.Film merely adds pictures to this mix and takes most of the mechanics away from our much funnier imagination. The kid makes this work as a comedy, but not in the way that Shepherd was strong. And the screenwriter has rearranged things to take away the unlikely connections. I thought this was funny, but if you want genius storytelling, get some old Shepherd tapes.",0,-999,1,-999,-999,-999,-999
A Christmas Story,"Bob Clark's magnificent ability to evoke a specific period with exact detail(whether it be Porky's in the 50s or Murder by Decree during Victorian London)is once again on display in this delight about the events leading up to Christmas for a child(Peter Billingsley, perfectly cast)so yearning to receive from Santa or his parents a Red Rifle BB gun. Everyone tells him it'll put his eye out and along the way the kid gets discouraged, even to the point that he pummels to a bloody nose the neighborhood bully who picks on him at the wrong time. It's really a ""time in the life"" of an older man reminiscing(in the wonderful voice of Jean Shephard who accentuates the pleasure of nostalgia and remembering back when)about his childhood, the parents, brother, friends, and certain moments around Christmas he can not ever forget, which live indelibly in his memory. Events covered include:The redneck neighbors' hounds which terrorize pops, the leg lamp(won by pops through a successful crossword puzzle) mother cleverly gets rid(much to the chagrin of pops)of through nefarious means, poor school chum who accepts reluctantly to prove(through the impenetrable triple dog dare)that his tongue would not stick to a frozen pole(and does), a little Orphan Annie decoder ring which doesn't exactly provide Ralphie with the results he would prefer, the nightmarish visit with Santa Claus, the outrageous layers of clothing Ralphie's brother would have to endure(barely able to walk), pops' various problems within the house(the Christmas tree lights, the basement furnace, the constant blowing of fuses), etc. The cast is absolutely perfect:Melinda Dillon as the always-worrying mother who comes through for Ralphie when he gets in the fight, Darren McGavin as the long-suffering father often a foil for misfortune(the leg lamp sequences are especially amusing), Ian Petrella as the little brother who doesn't like to eat and would prefer to play with his food(the moment where he's sobbing while hiding in a cabinet underneath the sink worried that pops would kill Ralphie over the fight is certainly a highlight), and Billingsley as the cute blond kid with glasses who endures much, so desperately pining for the dream gift which seems so far out of reach.

A Christmas Story,"The reason ""A Christmas Story"" lives on as a film is because the simple story of a boy and his family is something adults and children can relate to by connecting the various vignettes to memories of their own. What's so appealing about the film, too, is the way it makes us feel we're back in the 1940s era, with none of today's materialistic, modern technology touches to spoil a tale of childhood innocence way back then.Peter Billingsley as the boy who wants his Red Ryder rifle for Christmas gives what is probably one of the most natural child performances ever recorded on film. And Darren McGavin and Melinda Dillon are splendid as his parents, not always sensitive to his needs and sometimes doing foolish things--like forcing him to wear a complete bunny rabbit from his favorite aunt on Christmas Day--or his mother overdressing him in outdoor wear on a snowy day so that he can barely move.All of the scenes involving the playmate bullies are right on target with a nice pay-off when the boy finally stands up to the worst of the lot. There's an hilarious scene at a Chinese restaurant that has the waiters serenading the family before dinner--and the business about the sexy lamp in the window has got to be one of the funniest mishaps in the whole story.Whatever your memories of Christmas are, you're sure to find a glimpse of recognition here in this very clever parody of Christmas past.",1,1,1,0,0,1,0
A Christmas Story,"Nostalgic tale of a Ralphie Parker (Peter Billingsley) growing up in the 1940s (I believe). He wants nothing more than a Red Ryder Ranger Model Air Rifle (a BB gun for short) for Christmas but everyone tells him it will ""shoot your eye out"".That's about it for plot but the film has sequences that every child (and adult) can relate to. My favorites: Ralphie's best friend getting his tongue stuck to a pole when he's dared to lick it; Ralphie accidentally swearing in front of his father; the bully that threatens Ralphie and his friends every day until Ralphie beats him up (in a GREAT scene); Ralphie's constant fights with his little brother (wonderfully played by Ian Petrella) and Billingsley and his brother being terrified by a department store Santa.Also Melinda Dillon and Darren McGavin are just great as the parents-- especially Dillon. She has one uproarious scene where she gets Petrella to eat by imitating a pig! This was totally ignored when it came out in 1983 but has slowly developed a cult following. It's now considered one of the best Christmas movies ever made--right up there with ""It's a Wonderful Life"" (which was also ignored at its release).A charming, wonderful Christmas film.

A Christmas Story,"What can be said about this enduringly popular Yuletide favourite that hasn't already been said? After almost 30 years later, its frequent showings on TV continue to be a tradition; people can continue to relate to it, and be charmed, touched, and frequently laugh heartily.Humourist Jean Shepherd, who co-adapted his book ""In God We Trust, All Others Pay Cash"" with Leigh Brown and director / co-producer Bob Clark, takes a nostalgic look at his childhood in 1940's era Midwest America, when he, as a nine year old boy, coveted what he considered to be the ultimate Christmas present - The Red Ryder 200 Shot Carbine Action Air Rifle, and resorts to any and all methods to get this to happen.Shepherd himself narrates (and makes an uncredited on screen appearance as an irate department store customer) and Peter Billingsley wonderfully, memorably portrays his younger incarnation. Billingsley's own dialogue mixes well with Shepherd's uproarious, deliberately florid adult recollections. Part of what makes it so funny is the way that he recalls viewing (and exaggerating) everything as a child, right down to his frequent fantasies - being taunted with the now legendary ""You'll shoot your eyes out"" refrain, visualizing the cruel fate being inflicted upon him for the classic ""soap in the mouth"" punishment, or imagining rescuing his family from the nefarious Black Bart and gang. Highly impressive period recreation mix with lovely music (by Carl Zittrer and Paul Zaza) and the delightful evocation of all things Christmas. Highlight sequences include the Scut Farkas Affair, referring to the swaggering bully with the yellow eyes, the visit with a department store Santa (the priceless Jeff Gillen), the battle over the sexiest / tackiest lamp committed to celluloid, and the introduction of ""Chinese Christmas"" to the family.Very nice supporting performances by the hilarious Darren 'Carl Kolchak' McGavin as furnace fighting, profanity spewing Old Man and under-rated Melinda Dillon as the loving mother are also a big, big plus. I can actually remember being introduced to this movie, myself, as a child when we were treated to a viewing in school and being quizzed about it afterwards, which wasn't a bad way at all to test how well we could pay attention to details. Even now, as an adult, it hasn't lost its appeal for me, and it can continue to play to new generations for years to come without losing anything. It's an amazing, complete counterpoint to Clark's earlier, far creepier Christmas outing, ""Black Christmas"", which just goes to show how versatile the late director could be. It definitely ranks as another of his career highlights.10 out of 10.",1,1,0,1,1,1,0
A Christmas Story,"I'm not a huge traditionalist, but I do like to keep up certain traditions at times. Sometimes I watch non Christmas themed movies on Christmas, sometimes I do watch Christmas movies. Surprisingly enough, I never saw this movie, even with it's stature as a classic. At times, it seems like every person on the planet hails this as the greatest Christmas movie ever made. I don't personally think it is. I didn't enjoy it nearly as much as so many others have. That's not to say I disliked this movie. As a matter of fact, I enjoyed it very much. It's a really good film, and strikingly original, especially for a movie that's about Christmas. It's very gutsy in the approach, and I dug that a lot. A lot of this movie's success hinges on the shoulders of our hero, Ralphie. Peter Billingsley did a fantastic job as young Ralphie. He is extremely talented for his age back at this point. I was rooting for him all the way to get his B.B gun. He looked hilarious in a pink bunny outfit that he wore as well. Darren McGavin & Melinda Dillon are terrific as the parents, especially McGavin. My favorite moment is probably Ralphie & the icicle explanation as a cover up story for a B.B gun wound.

A Christmas Story,"A CHRISTMAS STORY (1983) **** Peter Billingsley, Melinda Dillon, Darren McGavin, Ian Petrella, Scott Schwartz. A perennial Yuletide classic! Based on the writings of Jean Shepherd (who has a cameo as a disgruntled shopper on line for a department store Santa) with a sharp, satirical jab at the commericalism of the holiday season circa the 1940s with little 9 year old Ralphie (memorable Billingsley) who simply wants a Red Ryder carbine air rifle with the possiblity of a huge disappointment ahead (`You'll shoot your eye out!') and his brilliant scheming to get just that as well as fighting off the school bully, putting up with his younger brother and his wise-ass buddies. Great period detail in the production design and a crusty turn by McGavin as `The Old Man' and Dillon as his smarter, better half.

A Christmas Story,"A Christmas Story (1983): Dir: Bob Clark / Cast: Peter Billingsley, Darren McGavin, Melinda Dillon, Ian Petrella, Scott Schwartz: Wonderfully innovative Christmas holiday account as reflected by the voice of the aged Ralphie Parker. As played by Peter Billingsley, he is nine, wears glasses, and desires a Red Ryder Carbine Action 200- shot Range Model air rifle for Christmas but is discouraged when everyone from his mother to his stern teacher to the store Santa warn that he ""can put an eye out with that thing."" Darren McGavin is hilarious as his father, cursing out the defective furnace, but cheers up when a prize arrives in the form of the infamous leg lamp. Melinda Dillon plays his mother who places soap in Ralphie's mouth when a foul word is accidentally uttered during a tire change. Ian Petrella plays younger brother who plays in his food and struggles to mobile himself in his snow suit. Scott Schwartz plays Flick, the bunt of bullying and the sucker who accepts the dare of sticking his tongue against frost on a pole. After directing Black Christmas Bob Clark lightens thing up yet discernment advised for young children who will likely not be ready for the film's darker themes and edgier humour.

A Christmas Story,"This odd little film has become the parallel-universe ""It's A Wonderful Life"" of our time. It brings up memories that many people can identify with - wanting - with all your heart - a toy that will ""shoot your eye out"", facing up to the school bully and then getting punished for being violent rather than being commended for courage, and for those of you up north, sticking your tongue on a frozen pole and getting stuck to it. This actually happened to my brother-in-law as a kid in Wisconsin.However, Ralphie, the child protagonist in our film, has a completely dysfunctional family. To be specific, he has a completely dysfunctional father. In the narration Ralphie never even calls him ""dad"" - he's just ""the old man"". ""The old man"" cares about nothing more than he cares for the tackiest of lamps that he received as an award that is made out of a mannequin's leg that he displays in a position of prominence in the living room. Ralphie's father is no George Bailey. If he got to see the world as it was if he never existed, no doubt the only noticeable difference would be that the tacky lamp would belong to someone else and Ralphie and his mother would be better off. The narration is wonderful as you see everything from a child's perspective, and if you remember your childhood at all, you can probably remember reasoning things out as Ralphie does. In Ralphie's world adults - including his parents - are the arbitrary givers of reward and punishment who all seem to be in odd and unreasoned alignment. These adults are mazes to be solved, not givers of lessons to be learned. However, as an adult, you'll see the humor in the situations too. Highly recommended.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Elf,"""Elf"" is a pretty cute film--but they're starting to overplay it a bit. Just this Christmas season, it's been on TV 1483857 times (give or take 2). And I worry that being shown so much that folks might have a backlash--might start to hate the film even though it's decent family entertainment and is worth your time.Will Ferrell stars as 'Buddy'--a STRANGE young man indeed. Apparently, as a baby he was accidentally kidnapped and brought back to the North Pole by Santa. Not knowing what to do with the boy so he gave him to an elf (Bob Newhart) to raise as his own. However, he's a terrible elf. Part of it that he's absolutely too big to live as an elf--and part of it is that he's a bit...well....stupid. Eventually, after not fitting in for a very long time, the elves inform Buddy that they now know who his read father is and Buddy leaves the Pole for New York City to find his dad. Once there, Buddy once again does NOT fit in--and makes a mess of most everything. Can Buddy sort all this out and connect with his dad or will the audience leave the theater feeling depressed and miserable (yeah, right!).The film has many funny moments (my favorite was when he exposed FAKE Santa to the kids waiting to see him), a few sweet ones and some very clichéd ones--but I can forgive this, as it IS a family comedy and I am not expecting Shakespeare!

Elf,"Elf isn't a perfect Christmas movie, but it was sweet and charming with a great cast. The script can be a little too fluffy and unfocused sometimes though, while the pace occasionally lags and some jokes such as Buddy eating the sweets felt forced. However, it does look terrific, with the locations striking and the cinematography very nice. The soundtrack is a nice addition too, it made me nostalgic and all the more ready for Christmas. The story while simple and a tad predictable is at least original and well-meaning, while the direction is credible. The cast is what gives Elf its staying power and charm. Although I am not a fan of Will Ferrell, I think he really shone here as Buddy, while Zooey Deschannel is beautiful and a huge part of the film's charm, James Caan is a suitably gruff father-like figure and Bob Newhart is wonderful. All in all, it is a sweet film if you forgive the slightly cliché ending, by all means not for all but the cast do save the day. 7/10 Bethany Cox",0,1,0,1,1,1,1
Elf,Orphan Buddy (Will Ferrell) sneaks in Santa (Edward Asner)'s bag and ends up in the North Pole. Papa Elf (Bob Newhart) raises Buddy as an elf. His giantness causes all kinds of problems. Santa allows him to go to New York City to find his birth father Walter Hobbs (James Caan) who is actually on Santa's naughty list. He gets a job at a store and befriends fellow worker Jovie (Zooey Deschanel).Childlike Will Ferrell is giving off so much joy and innocence. He is so silly that it is impossible to not laugh at his slapstick humor. He fully commits and that's what makes it so hilarious. The only minor difficulty lies with James Caan. His personality is way too intense for a wacky comedy. But it picks up whenever he reunites with sweetheart Zooey Deschanel. And he has good fun with his brother Michael.

Elf,"Accidentally finding his way into Santa's bad once Christmas Eve, little baby orphan Buddy ends up in the north pole, where he is raised by the elves as one of their own.

However Buddy's natural smile and elfish enthusiasm doesn't really fit in with New York, not to mention a father who rejects him.When I first saw the trailer for this film I laughed slightly but I also thought that it could easily be just awful. Despite this fear I decided to go and see it on the basis of seeing Ferrell in the Reloaded MTV spoof on the DVD and being very funny. I was glad that I did as the film was refreshingly funny very enjoyable despite the weaknesses inherent in a seasonable film of this nature. The jokes are a mix of adult and children - but not separately, the humour is of a nature families can all enjoy rather than being of a `one for me and one for the kids' type.The film does get a little sweet towards the end, but it manages to avoid this usual trap for the majority of the film and can't be expected to not be all Christmas cheer at some point! The fish out of water stuff is pretty funny and Farrell makes his character funny without being annoying to the audience (as he feared he might be from the trailer). Caan is good but has to work with the `scrooge' character of the film and thus gets fewer laughs. The support cast is good with fun turns from Newhart, Asner and Steenburger.It does get a little sickly sweet towards the end and the fish out of water jokes do wear a little thin towards the end but mostly it is very funny and refreshingly fun to watch.

Elf,"The perfect holiday movie for the cynical New Yorker (or anybody from any other metropolis) is so colorful and cheerful, yet not one that will give you a sugar overdose. It's the story of Buddy the elf, Will Ferrell, an actor I normally can't abide. He's an orphan who crawled into Santa's bag and was adopted by bachelor elf Bob Newhart and when he learns the truth of who he is heads to the Big Apple to locate his father, the cynical James Caan, and ends up finding a family.Stepmom Mary Steenburgen (along with Dianne Wiest and Sissy Spacek the perfect on-screen mom) immediately takes to him, half brother Daniel Tay finds a playmate and world weary Zooey Deschanel goes from wanting to kill him on their first meeting to completely entranced by his sweetness. Caan must find the kid in himself to from the Scrooge like publisher to a loving husband and father, and that will take a Christmas miracle.Having not seen this until now, I felt like a complete freeze miser for unintentionally missing it, although I did see the musical on Broadway in 2012. This film pays great tribute to our modern Christmas culture with references to the Franken-Bass TV specials of my childhood and even gets a very funny Keebler elf reference in as well. Who better to play Santa than Ed Asner? He's completely loveable with absolutely no Lou Grant gruffness.One of the funniest gags is the reemergence of the long defunct Gimbles department store where Buddy meets Deschanel and turns the Santa village upside down by redecorating it overnight. When he surprises her in the employee lounge (complete with shower) as she sings ""Baby It's Cold Outside"", it's a magical moment, one of many that starts with the sight of Santa's real village.Everybody is absolutely perfect here, not a false note in the film. So old fashioned in theme but very modern in spirit, this never falters in any way. The ensemble seems to have been magically delicious in loving the script because they are all filled with joy even when acting grumpy like veteran little actor Peter Dinklage, playing one of Caan's prestigious clients whom Ferrell accidentally insults. Putting my own big city cynicism away for the evening, this made me feel like Scrooge the morning after all of his nightmares when the spirit of Christmas returned to him.

This falls somewhere in the middle.Hipsters are happy to see Zooey Deschanel in this movie. I am more concerned with why she and Will Ferrell are matched up. If it is not strange enough that she would fall for a seemingly psychotic homeless man, there is a thirteen year age difference.

Elf,"You may expect this film to be a little on the kiddie side, but in fact it it is a great family comedy with jokes for all ages. The story is told by Papa Elf (Bob Newhart), who tells the story of his son. Basically Santa (Edward Asner) was delivering at an orphanage, and a baby managed to get out his crib and crawl into Santa's sack (to get a toy), and he was brought to the North Pole. Papa raised this boy, he named Buddy, as his own, and as he grew he learnt the elf world as if he was one. But it is after he overhears that he is human that Buddy (Will Ferrell) decides he should find his real family. Papa gives him a photo he has kept of his birth father, Walter (James Caan), who deals with book publishing, and is unfortunately on the naughty list. So Buddy sets off to New York, and with his childlike innocence discovers all the wonders of the city. When he does meet Walter, he does not believe he is his son, or in Santa, so till he can get to him again, Buddy stays in the near toy store, where he meets his beautiful love interest, Jovie (Zooey Deschanel). The second time he meets his Dad, Buddy is confirmed from DNA results of his biology, and Walter does eventually let him come home with him to meet wife Emily (Back to the Future Part III's Mary Steenburgen) and son Michael (Daniel Tay). Walter does try to make Buddy more normal by taking him to work, and giving him normal clothes, but his childish behaviour still causes chaos, especially when the employees are talking to short children's book writer Miles Finch (Peter Dinklage), who Buddy keeps calling Elf. Walter loses his patience and sends Buddy away, but when Santa crashes in the middle of central park because he has run low on Christmas spirit to power the sleigh, everyone shows they believe by singing along with Jovie to help, even Scrooge-like Walter.

Elf,"In a concession to my eleven year old granddaughter, I watched ""Elf"" yesterday with her. Quite honestly, I thought she was suggesting ""Alf"" to me, so when she pulled it up on Netflix I managed an inward groan to myself. The end result though, was that I came away pleasantly entertained by the naive innocence of the Elf character Buddy, disarmingly portrayed by Will Ferrell. I don't usually go for pictures starring former SNL comedians because they're usually mindless fluff, but this one had a way of holding your attention to see what silliness comes next. I got a kick out of the sight gags and Buddy's one-sided view of a world he had no knowledge of once he hit New York City on a mission to find his real father. The script writers apparently weren't too concerned about him finding his real mother, a thought that occurred to me throughout, especially with each time that photo of a young Walter Hobbs (James Caan) was shown with his one time girlfriend. But that quickly gets lost in the shuffle of Buddy's precarious encounters with the staff at Gimbel's and Santa's (Ed Asner) arrival fueled by the Christmas Spirit provided by all of Buddy's new found friends and family. I can't really claim that this will wind up a holiday staple with me, but for a one time experience, ""Elf"" will bring a smile. Because in the words of Buddy himself - ""I like to smile. Smiling's my favorite""!",0,1,1,0,0,1,0
Elf,"Charming Christmas confection--about a boy raised by elves in the North Pole who grows up and journeys to N.Y.C. in search of his biological father--puts a clever spin on even the most familiar gags, successfully walking a fine line between absurdist comedy and holiday schmaltz. Will Ferrell looks like a string-bean in yellow tights and, with his mass of curly hair peeking out from underneath his elf's hat, he could easily be used as a walking punchline. Fortunately, director Jon Favreau's handling of ""Elf"" is incredibly nimble, treating Ferrell and his naive character Buddy with the utmost respect; you can laugh at all the silly pranks without ever feeling guilty. Favreau's work is smooth, and he's assembled an incredible supporting cast of character actors to back his star, though some may find the climactic moments (involving Edward Asner as Santa Claus) a bit too literal--and the movie is certainly funnier before we get to this point. Still, the special effects are kept to a minimum in order to let the people shine...and that's not only refreshing, it's heart-warming. *** from ****",1,1,0,1,0,0,1
Elf,"Will Ferrell is one of my favourite movie funny-men, but even so, I had my reservations about Elf: it is a Christmas film after all, and they do have tendency to get rather sappy for my liking.Still, I put aside my doubts, and to start with, I admit I had a chuckle-some time, with Will providing some amusing 'fish-out-of-water' moments as wide-eyed innocent Buddy, the titular 'elf' (in reality, a human adopted when a baby by one of Santa's workers) who leaves North Pole to travel to New York, where he hopes to find his real father (played by James Caan).Unfortunately, the makers of this film just can't help themselves, and gradually allow over-sentimentality to take control, before unloading a whole sackful of saccharine sweet clichés in the final act: Buddy's mean, inconsiderate father miraculously transforms into a loving dad; good old Santa pops up needing some Christmas spirit to power his sleigh; and everyone starts singing carols and being all happy and stuff! Hell, Buddy even gets the girl (pretty shop assistant Jovie, played by Zooey Deschanel). Gag! A bit of cheesy schmaltz is to be expected this time of year, but this amount in one massive dose is just too much for me to handle.I rate Elf an unexceptional 5.5 out of 10, very generously bumped up to 6 because, hey, it's Christmas!!!.",0,0,0,0,0,-999,0
Elf,"Will Ferrell plays Buddy, who grew up with Santa's helpers, thinking he was an Elf. This is his story. Ferrell is much better here than he is in other movies. In fact, this is the only role I like Ferrell in. Pleasant viewing for those who like a modern fairy tale.Born to a single mom, baby Buddy was placed in an orphanage, and one Christmas night, while Santa (Ed Asner) was eating a cookie, crawled out of his bed and into Santa's toy sack. Upon discovery when Santa got back to the North Pole, Papa Elf (Bob Newhart) raised Buddy, who was quite larger than the other elves. Finding out his true identity, and who his real father was (James Caan), Buddy set out to find him in New York.When he does, comedy follows, as Buddy doesn't know any of the customs of the real world. In the process he makes a friend in pretty Jovie (Zooey Deschanel) who was dressed as an Elf, working at a store preparing for Christmas.Self absorbed dad is made to see the light, And eventually enlists Buddy to help create new, interesting children stories for new books.December 2019 update: I first saw this in 2005 but today, Christmas 2019, we just finished watching it again. A very nice and funny Christmas movie.",1,1,1,1,1,0,1
Elf,"Jon Favreu and Will Ferrel as a director/star combo is a good premise and execution here in Elf, as they create a film that assuredly works for the whole family. This is because the film is as much directed towards fans of Ferrel from Saturday Night Live (which ranges with both sexes from little kids to people in their middle ages) as it is towards those looking for the holiday spirit. Bottom line is, he makes the movie fun to watch, among a cast of well knowns (the likes of Bob Newhart, Ed Asner, Mary Steenburgen, Artie Lange, and Andy Richter pop up, and James Caan has a better than average supporting role). Here, Ferrel plays Buddy, a man who's grown up adopted in the North Pole. Raised by Elves, it pains him to find out that he isn't one, and that his father didn't even make Santa's 'Nice' list this year. He decides to seek him out in New York, and has a brief stint working in a department store, followed by the mailroom of his father's office in the Empire state building.From what I described of the plot it sounds a little routine, and it is, but there are some things in the story that are inspired, though most of the joy in the film comes from Ferrel's Buddy. Some might take his performance as over the top or lame, however I think he finds just the right bit of gleeful un-awareness at what he does, good and not so good, and there are a few real howlers too. Best scene- Buddy confronts the department store Santa in front of the children (this is a near draw with the scene in the recent Bad Santa where Billy Bob beats down the plastic reindeer in the store). Only the last part of the film, the Christmas Night bit, doesn't work at all. A nice little Christmas comedy, which can be seen after the Holidays too. B+",1,1,1,1,1,0,1
Elf,"Confession time: Until just a couple of hours ago, I had never seen this now-classic Christmas comedy starring Will Ferrell in the title role. He's an actual human who as a baby was taken to the North Pole accidentally and was raised by elder elf Bob Newhart. After becoming the least prolific of workers at Santa's Workshop, he decides to go to New York to find his biological father who's played by James Caan. I'll stop there and just say this was quite funny and had also some touching scenes. Because this was a family film, there's no dirty language nor any adult situations. In summary, Elf is a wonderful comedy suitable for kids ""from 1 to 92""!",1,1,1,1,1,0,1

In panic, they call in a little guy. He shows up with a formula. The formula of this project is half ""Big"" and half ""The Family Man"" and its ilk. Small wonder that the film ends with our little guy writing the story that we see.I suppose it is well enough done for what it is. But the problem with this is also embedded in the story.

Elf,"As a baby, Buddy {Will Ferrell} crept out of his crib in the orphanage right into Santa's goody bag. Thus he grows up at the North Pole working with the elves in Santa's work shop. Now firmly grown up physically, Buddy is shocked to learn that he is a human being, not an elf. So upon hearing that his father lives in New York, he sets off to find him. But can he survive New York? More to the point, can New York survive Buddy?Like him or loathe him, Will Ferrell has a nice line in physical comedy. So with that, Elf is the perfect vehicle to showcase his exuberance. But with that also comes the problem with the film. For it feels {actually it is} like director John Favreau and writer David Berenbaum have plopped Ferrell into a fish out of water scenario and stitched together a number of sketches for him to run thru. The outcome of which may induce some amiable comedy along the way, but renders the finale a weak attempt at holiday message emotion. The supporting cast also suffer in the wake of Ferrell's domination. Something that annoys when you consider we have the likes of James Caan and Mary Steenburgen trying to breathe on the sidelines.There's enough here to make it a safe holiday viewing for the kids and those adults who have a penchant for Ferrell's comedy. But really it's a patchwork quilt of a picture, with the makers playing it all too by the numbers just to sell tickets. 5/10",0,0,0,-1,-999,-999,-1
Elf,"""Elf"" directed by Jon Favreau turned out the other night on a cable channel. Not having see this popular film before, we decided to take a look. Frankly, it was a pleasant surprise. The film, written by David Barenbaum, takes great pleasure in bringing together the unreal world of Santa Claus and his helpers, the elves, with present day Manhattan. What a ride are we in for! As played by Will Ferrell with deadpan manner, Buddy, the elf of the story is wiser than some of the people he meets along the way. The encounter with a father, Walter, he didn't know until now, is at the center of the story. The jaded city people are not ready for this childlike figure that is all kindness. James Caan, an otherwise intense type, makes a great contribution to the film. Mr. Favreau gets good performances from his talented cast.""Elf"" will be appreciated not only by children, but those young at heart who will have a great time watching the film.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1
Elf,"Basically, director Jon Favreau's goofy but entertaining Christmas comedy ""Elf"" is a 'fish-out-of-water' saga, and David Berenbaum's screenplay relies heavily on incongruity. Visually, ""Elf"" is a delightful little movie with interesting characters. The North Pole set and the costumes that the elves wear are colorful.""Elf"" concerns an infant up for adoption at an orphanage who crawls into Santa Claus' gift bag during Christmas and winds up at the North Pole. As it turns out, he is raised as one of the elves, specifically Papa Elf (Bob Newhart), who serves as the narrator. At six feet, three inches, Buddy (Will Ferrell) cannot do anything right as an elf. Ironically, Buddy has no idea that he isn't an elf. The revelation that he is not an elf staggers him. One day he is shown a picture of his mother and father. Tragically, Buddy's mother died without informing his father Walter Hobbs (James Caan of ""The Godfather"") that he had sired him. Buddy sets out from the North Pole and walks on foot to Manhattan where he finally comes face-to-face with Walter. Walter is married, has a teenage son, and works at a book publishing firm. Reluctantly, Walter takes Buddy into his house and disasters galore ensue. Briefly, Buddy holds a job at Gimbels' Department Store in the toy department. When he assaults a man masquerading as Santa Claus, Buddy lands in jail and Walter bails him out. Eventually, after exasperating Walter continually with his adolescent antics, Buddy leaves and is standing on a bridge surveying the river when Santa Claus (Ed Asner) streaks overhead in his sleight with his reindeer. Something goes wrong and Santa has to crash land. Naturally, Buddy heads to his rescue.Light, frivolous nonsense from start to finish, ""Elf"" qualifies as scintillating comedy with Ferrell having a field day as the tallest elf on record. This is Ferrell at his finest in an emerald jacket and golden tights. Mind you, the former ""Saturday Night Live"" comedian is an acquired taste. He behaves like an imbecile and he stoops to conqueror with lowest common denominator humor. James Caan is appropriately harried as his selfish father, and Oscar winning actress Mary Steenburgen plays Walter's wife Emily, while Zooey Deschanel is cast as Jovie, Buddy's love interest.

Elf,"Will Ferrell has escaped the curse of most SNL veterans who try to transition to major motion pictures (at least those who have tried to make the jump in recent years) and manages to produce the most consistently funny films of probably any of them (including Mike Myers).""Elf"" is destined to be a holiday classic, one of those you watch every year around the holiday season. Ferrell, a human baby adopted by elves (some scenes of him with his elf dad, played in a dead pan performance by Bob Newhart, provide the film with some of its funniest sight gags), goes off in search of his real father, a search that takes him to NYC. The joke of course is that Ferrell, wandering around the streets of New York in his elf costume and eating gum off of subway station railings, doesn't seem out of the ordinary in a place like NY, where people are used to crazies, and where every department store has a troupe of workers dressed as elves anyway.He finds his dad (played by James Caan), falls in love (with Zooey Deschanel) and helps save Christmas when Santa's sleigh malfunctions due to a lack of Christmas spirit. It's all very funny and harmless, with a sense of humour that manages to satisfy both those who like their Christmas cheer served warm and those sarcastic cynics (like me) who watch ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" and root for the Grinch.Favorite line, delivered when Ferrell gets a job in the mail room of a children's book publishing house: ""This reminds me of the North Pole, except that it smells like mushrooms and everyone looks like they want to hurt me.""

Elf,"Elf (2003): Dir: Jon Favreau / Cast: Will Ferrell, James Caan, Zooey Deschanel, Mary Steenburgen, Bob Newhart: The story of little people doing big things, or in this case big people doing even bigger things. Will Ferrell stars as Buddy who crawled into Santa's sack upon his visit to the orphanage. He is raised at the North Pole where cheer and good will are the norm. When he learns that he is human he treks to New York to reunite with his human family. His father works in publishing and sees Buddy as a lunatic. He eventually lands a job in a toy store where a young lady with a winning singing voice catches his heart. Neat concept and funny situations and a conclusion where Buddy obtains the best of both worlds. Directed by Jon Favreau who previously made a very different film called Swingers. This time he aims for a different audience. He is backed by Ferrell with outrageous bursts of enthusiasm in an overgrown elf costume that is appropriately out of place. James Caan makes a great foil as his father. Zooey Deschanel is pleasant but as a female shop worker she is a predictable romantic prop. The biggest disappointment is Mary Steenburgen who is limited as Caan's wife. Bob Newhart narrates the film as Buddy's parental elf, which adds that fable like affect to its presentation.

King George III who now historians believe may have been suffering with Porphria. A bored queen Charlotte who filled her sad days with games manipulating her royal subjects. It wasnt until part way in I realised she was being played by a black actress. I thought she was amazing actually her face said it all. She obviously loved her husband but had no idea how to deal with his madness and everytime she could she should visit him in more lucid moments. It must have been quite hard for her to deal with.Then she meets the beautiful and flawless Daphne Bridgerton. It was then I was slowly introduced to the family. Daphne an innocent who was meeting the Queen on her coming out. With comments of the queen one would expect Daphne to have a queue of suitors, well she did sort of but sadly her over proective brother ruined that for her.The story is slow unfolding we get to meet all the main characters, and their stories enrwine within the story. We get to meet the family the Bridgertons i loved the mother, and Eloise too, and the eldester brother who was lost as he just had no idea how to run a family and was besotted with an opera singer. Benedict Bridgerton bored of society who slipped quietly into the unknown world of gay, and orgies and arists. Colin a quiet young man kind.then we met The Duke and i fell in love lol.

Bridgerton,"The intrigue of Bridgerton comes from its tangled ecosystem of friends, frenemies, suitors, and voyeurs. The most exciting moments often come not from scenes of bombast but in the whispers that shape the season. There are men in this story, all of whom are interesting and often deeply alluring, but this is a show most concerned with the plight and passions of women. It does not feel the need to force high-concept drama or unnecessarily soapy details into their lives to make them interesting. There are romps in the meadows, kisses in the rain, and meddling mothers at tea-time, and it is all executed with such delicate flair that Bridgerton makes the usual fresh again. This is not just a show that takes its own concept seriously: It's one that respects the romance genre as a whole, and I cannot tell you how much of a relief it is to see that, especially given how widely ignored or derided romance novels are by the cultural mainstream. Van Dusen has enough trust in both his source material and the very concept of a Regency romance saga. The show gives every character in this vast ensemble room to breathe and the attention their unique plights deserve.
Creator Van Dusen makes Bridgerton's many twists and turns satisfying to the end, even when they're predictable, and the young cast of mostly unknowns brings zip and depth of feeling to material that could otherwise feel slight.

Certainly no women would have been playing an instrument, the producers would have had a source vast quantities of horse manure to cover the streets that were dense with smog and the bodies of impoverished.I've had too much reality this year - too much time with oncologists, hospitals, pain management and hospices, too much time in cemeteries and consoling family members.There is no shortage of reality and if I want more of it I know where to find it.Well done to everybody in volved - looking forward to the next X number of series",1,1,1,0,1,1,1

The Crown,"Love historical dramas, and it fascinated me just as much to see one centred around (as of now) our longest reigning monarch, a title that for a long time was given to Queen Victoria. There was so much talent involved that my interest was sparked further, despite admittedly not being the biggest fan of Netflix. 'The Crown' turned out to be a wonderful series, at its very best some of the best television seen in a while and in a completely different league to much of anything else Netflix has done (so much so that it had to be a check to see that it definitely came from Netflix). Season 1 was so well executed in every regard, while Season 2 boasted even richer material. Totally get the adoration, while sharing some viewers' misgivings about the inaccuracies and some biased and distorted characterisations (the Duke and Duchess of Windsor coming off worst). Vanessa Kirby for my tastes was a bit too annoying as Margaret as well. However, the great things far eclipse the not so good. When 'The Crown' was great, it was the very meaning of a crowning achievement. It couldn't have been any more classy and sumptuous visually. The photography and production and costume design are evocative and a sight to behold. The music for me wasn't too intrusive or low-key and was beautiful scoring on its own. The main theme is not easy to forget. Writing probes a lot of thought and intrigue, it is much more than soap-opera and doesn't feel too modern (not like 'Victoria'). Loved the intimacy and subtle tension of the storytelling in each episode, the deliberate pace in no way a hindrance, and the character chemistry scintillates. The characters are very compellingly written, with enough balance in characterisation to overshadow the instances of one-sidedness and most of them have more than one layer. Cannot find many qualms with the acting. Claire Foy is dignity and class personified and Matt Smith acts every bit as splendidly with lots of authority. One of the biggest standouts of the near-uniformly strong support (Kirby being the exception) is the powerhouse that is John Lithgow, so much so that one can look past misgivings of him not being quite right physically (being too tall for one by nearly a foot, Churchill was not a tall man). Overall, deserving of the acclaim it's garnered. Not quite perfect but really quite wonderful and something of an achievement. 9/10 Bethany Cox",1,1,1,1,1,1,1
The Crown,"It could be one of many historical dramas. But it is more. A portrait of a time. The sketch discovering the lead traits of a reign. A story about power in different, subtle manner. And one of lovely series about the essence of a world of changes. The serie has many virtues and the impecable script becomes the admirable support for beautiful performances. Because it is a film about the roots of power. And about the answers, many corrects, to different challenges. An unique serie.

There are also servants to do the simplest tasks for the family members!

The Crown,"The most expensive series in the history of Netflix, The Crown is a 10- part series about the early years of Elizabeth as Queen, and the effect that her rule had on her husband and sister.As the niece of the King, Elizabeth and her sister Margaret enjoyed all the perks of royalty without being in line for the throne. This ended when King Edward (Alex Jennings) abdicated. Having no issue, his brother Bertie (Jared Harris) became George VI. While Elizabeth (Claire Foy) and her husband, Prince Philip (Matt Smith) were in Africa, King George died. And greatness was thrust upon the shoulders of Elizabeth.The series shows Elizabeth's adjustment, her dealings with people like Winston Churchill, Anthony Eden, her Uncle David, the ex-King and now Duke of Windsor, and learning ultimately that there was a procedure, and while she ruled, she needed to follow the decisions of others.One of her biggest family problems concerned her sister Margaret (Vanessa Kirby) and her affair with a divorced man, Peter Townsend (Ben Miles). It's hard to imagine nowadays how scandalous divorce was, and in this case, worse because it looked like Townsend had left his wife for Margaret. This caused many problems for the Crown and between the sisters. Sadder yet, though the relationship was broken up, Margaret ended up divorced herself. There were also issues with Philip piloting - it seemed as if many family matters had to be approved of at a higher level. It must have been very frustrating. (Divorce was still an issue when Jacqueline Kennedy was invited to the Palace, and the Palace refused to let her bring her divorced sister Lee. ""But she's my host,"" Jacqueline objected, ""and my sister!"" Couldn't bring her.)The series spares nothing in terms of opulence, the copying of actual gowns worn and other fashion looks of the era, and manages to work in actual footage of the coronation as people watched it on black and white television. The actors do a magnificent job, particularly Claire Foy who somehow IS the young Elizabeth; John Lithgow as Winston Churchill, Matt Smith as Philip, Alex Jennings as the Duke of Windsor. Though Vanessa Kirby is a wonderful Margaret, the real Margaret was actually more beautiful, though Kirby shows her flirtatious personality and charisma. Foy and Kirby also demonstrate beautifully the subtle and not-so-subtle moments of rivalry between the two women.In terms of historical accuracy, from what I know, the series is accurate with a few caveats. One isn't really the fault of the production. It's said that Churchill's wife had the portrait that Sutherland did of her husband destroyed and supervised the destruction; in truth, the servants took it upon themselves to burn it as it was just somewhere taking up space. Clementine is reported to have said, ""That's what I would have done.""Also, the Duchess of Windsor was not present during King George's abdication speech. I believe the story of Churchill and his secretary was fictionalized to bring in his awareness of the hospital problems.The producers worked very hard to make The Crown as accurate as possible, working with historians, biographers, someone who actually worked in the Palace, newsreels, and newspapers. As with all non- fiction dramas, however, there were some liberties with the timing of events.Truly excellent - can't wait for season 2.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1

The Crown,"One of those shows that was massively hyped when it started and now seems to exist quietly in the background, loved by only a few.For me it lacks total historical accuracy, the people playing the key figures never look anything like them, and it's all a bit soap opera-esque.",0,-1,0,0,0,-999,0
The Crown,"It is a testament to how good this series is that a dramatization of such a well known person and such well known events could be so mesmerizing. The detail is just mind boggling. There is such painstaking detail to recreate each scene from Commonwealth tours to minor ones. The sets are sumptuous and the costumes are perfect. No wonder it cost so much to make. The writing is superb with such good dialog in the intimate scenes that one only imagined before. Just finished season 1, all 10 episodes and each one is better than the last. Quite shocking to see on screen (even though it is known) is the vitriolic hatred Edward VIII had for the rest of the Windsors due to the treatment of Wallis.Some of the outstanding aspects of this first season are the handling of marriage with divorced persons - both with Edward VIII and Wallis Simpson and with Princess Margaret's love for the divorced Peter Townsend. A well handled angle is the difficult position the Queen finds herself in. Even marital conflict is shown with Prince Philip portrayed rather negatively. Do feel more sympathy for the Queen after watching this series.The flaw in this series is the jarring miscasting of some of the characters. Jared Harris looks too different from George VI and the actress who plays the Queen Mother is also terribly miscast - she should have been a plumper more round looking actress. They don't capture their essences. Vanessa Kirby is a bit indelicate for Margaret - maybe a bit large. Claire Foy does a good imitation of the Queen's accent but she has a rather hesitant look - more suitable for the household staff than the Queen. She doesn't look regal. But maybe she will change later. Physically her face is rather too different. Surprisingly Matt Smith the weird actor from Dr Who although uglier than Prince Phillip does capture his essence. John Lithgow even though too tall acts so well as Churchill it's quite award worthy. But the errors in casting don't prevent this series being outstanding television.",1,-1,1,1,0,1,1
The Crown,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningSEASON 4After the political assassination of her brother Lord Mountbatten (Charles Dance) at the hands of the IRA, Queen Elizabeth II (Olivia Colman) must brave the dawning of a new age. As Britain elects its first female Prime Minister, in the shape of the divisive Margaret Thatcher (Gillian Anderson), whose policies throw the country in to turmoil, Elizabeth watches as her son Charles (Josh O'Connor) strikes up a relationship with Diana Spencer (Emma Corrin), a commoner with her own free spirited will that throws the traditional royal style in to disarray, which blossoms into a tumultuous marriage that bears two children but becomes a desperate facade.It says something that I've come in to The Crown on Season Four, as being no royalist, nothing appealed to me about watching the previous three. However, the 1980s was a funky, transformative period, from the music, to the fashion, to what were then current events going on, and that made the new season look all that more irresistible. The show has been hitting the headlines recently, with some calling for a disclaimer, stating that it's a fictionalised account of real events, but in an age with 'celebrities' baring all in reality shows, the Royals remain elusive to the public, leaving any portrayal of them open to any wild speculation that can be dreamt up.There are many who cling to the saintliness of Diana, especially since her death, about her selflessness and compassion, and how she was too good for the snooty, cold royals (with some even theorizing her untimely end in the Paris tunnel may have been less of a tragic accident and more a calculated bumping off!), and this show certainly plays to that impression. All the more wonderful, then, that in one of three powerhouse female performances, Corrin captures her shyness and vulnerability so perfectly, while Colman fits the skin of the queen to a tee, and Anderson absolutely nails the determination and conviction of Thatcher.There was never a more explosive time in British politics and culture than the 1980s, and with such an iconic time serving as the backdrop, and with such magnificent performances, something I wouldn't normally be interested in has proven to be quite a pleasant surprise. ****",1,1,0,0,1,1,0

The Crown,"(Flash Review)If you ever wanted to get an inside scoop into how the royal family truly functions, this is a prime example as I'm pretty sure this is mostly true to history. It follows Queen Elizabeth II from a young princess as she grows into 'the crown' as Queen. Each episode focuses on a nicely contained subject or event and all details are true to period and highly accurate. You get a neat perspective to see how the Queen interacts with the Prime Minister (played amazingly by John Lithgow) and parliament, her sister, husband and parents. As well as her uncle, The King, who abdicated the thrown for his love, who had two previous husbands, making her ineligible to be his queen. There is also a surprising amount of power or influence given to those in charge of maintaining tradition and honor to the family lineage and to the crown. Great pacing, smart dialog, high quality production value and it is very engaging as the acting, dialog and episode scripts are spot on.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1

The Crown,"Matt Smith, who played the role of Philip, Duke of Edinburgh was definitely a horribly wrong cast, even the records shown that he was indeed a womanizer and adulterer when he was young, but casting this Matt Smith, with a long and narrow face, always slant to one side neck, street-thug like walking attitude, more like a clown or jerk instead, a cave-in crescent cucumber face always with a low class mockery smile-like sneer, and worst of all, such a terrible actor to play this important role, I simply couldn't hold myself too keen to watch this series and would tried every way to skip forward every time when he appeared. In China, there's an old saying: ""A rat dropping will soil a whole pot of porridge."" This is exactly what I felt when Matt Smith's face first shown on the screen. Boy oh boy, what an ugly dropping. Another ridiculous thing happened in the 1st episode was when these royal couple changing vows to each other: ""....For better or worse; for richer or poorer..."" Jesus, I just couldn't help laughing out loud! Do you really and seriously think these specific part of the vow could be appropriately applied to the first family of England? Their future could only be Better and Richer and nothing else, folks. So this was a practical joke to a commoner like me.But except this unfit cast to play this important historical role, this drama series indeed is grandeur magnificently made.An afterthought immediately after finished watching S01E09:If compare Jeff Daniel in ""Godless"" with John Lithgow, who played Winston Churchill in this series, John Lithgow should have won the Best Leading Actor instead in this year's Emmy's Award. The role Jeff Daniel's performed in Godless, in my opinion, was good but not great. What Lithgow had shown us is not only great but perfect. His acting talent is at a genius level.

The Crown,"Being right in the middle of season 4, I find it very difficult to express a global judgment for the series as a whole. I wasn't even sure if I cared to watch this, being not interested in the least in the British royal family.However, the first two seasons were intriguing and showed some unexpected sides of the family. Obviously, one should always consider that a good part of this is fiction, however, the feelings and behaviour of those involved are believable and there is a development of characters that make sense compared to whatever we know about them from ""real life"".More than Elizabeth, I found the characters and background of Philip and Margaret developed in a way that makes one almost - but not quite - sympathise with them. Philip was a sort of mongrel, second-rate royal, who grew up without the care of a proper family and ended up playing second fiddle to a queen. In a privileged environment, but still second rate all his life.The same applies to the abrasive and controversial figure of Margaret. Her dismal love story with Townsend seemed to have failed more because of her clinging to her status than for the meddling of her bothersome family. However, this point is dismissed in the series, with the family getting most of the blame.Finally, the Duke of Windsor saga is also presented in a somehow romantic light, but in reality, witnesses to the events claim that ""David"" was not keen at all about reigning and that he was clingy and weak and Simpson offered him a magnificent excuse to drop out of his responsibilities. He might have lived to regret it, but for sure his great ""love story"" was no picnic nor so great as depicted.After many historically charged episodes, the third series was drab and dull, with older Elizabeth by Olivia Colman nowhere near as charismatic as her younger version. Episode after episode of strikes, desperate miners and local tragedies, with grey and boring supporting actors, the only spark provided by older Margaret and her domestic crisis.Finally, series 4 started much stronger that the previous one, but being right in the middle of it, I am afraid the Diana saga will eat up most of the screen time.",0,0,0,0,-999,-999,0
The Crown,"The Crown is an outstanding show. It beautifully shows the life of the Royal family and the reign of Queen Elizabeth II. Historical shows and films always hit it out of the park when made with accuracy, excellent direction, production and style. The Crown is an example of this. It is made with such style, poise and charm one is simply taken by the lives of the family and great historic figures over those years. The acting is truly first class as is the production of the series which makes a dynamic, eventful and truly engaging show. Claire Foy is exceptional as the Queen as are the rest of the cast.

The Crown,"I've now watched the three available seasons of The Crown and felt the need to comment on the cast changes from the first two seasons to season three with one-on-one comparisons.Claire Foy vs. Olivia Coleman as Queen Elizabeth. This is a huge win for Foy's nervous smile over Coleman's stone face. Foy has at least some warmth and grace in her manner. Coleman is like a statue. I can read between the lines to see what Foy's Queen is actually thinking. Nothing is coming in from Coleman's cranium. The lights are out. Coleman's mouth seems to have a natural frown to it, (she has my sympathy- so does mine and people often complain that I don't smile enough). It makes her seem cold and uncomfortable. Foy has some nervousness but an inner strength that comes through.Matt Smith vs. Tobias Menzies as Prince Phillip. I only know Prince Phillip from interviews and documentaries but he seems a strong, distinguished man of great presence. That comes though much more in Menzies' performance than in Smith's. Smith has a prominent brow and always seems to be staring at the camera from under it. It gives the impression of somebody who is always up to something. Philip in his younger days may have been a bit of a bounder. So maybe that's appropriate but Menzies is more my image of Phillip, although I'm not sure where his accent came from.Vanessa Kirby vs. Helena Bonham-Cater as Princess Margaret. Kirby, a statuesque beauty, certainly makes an impression. If they ever do a reboot of the 60's British TV Series the Avengers, Kirby would make an excellent Mrs. Peel with her slinky sexiness. Unfortunately, Margaret was more the stature of Bonham-Carter, whose lower-key bemusement seems to hit the mark. But she would have had a hard =-time playing the young, delicate-looking beauty Margaret was in the 50's. I certainly hope to see a lot more the charismatic Kirby but HBC wins this one.Victoria Hamilton and Marion Bailey as Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother. Neither made much of an impression or looked much like her. The episodes didn't seem to focus on her, even though she seems to have had a hard time seeing the power behind the throne shift away from her, (she didn't even want to leave Buckingham Palace). An under-developed character played in an under-whelming manner by both.Alex Jennings and Derek Jacobi as the Duke of Windsor. Jennings was a strange Prince Charles in Peter Morgan's ""The Queen"", trying to manipulate events to his advantage. He's far, far better as ""David"", a role he seems born to play. He looks the part and plays the man as the chess-player he clearly was, totally dedicated to his own desires. I'm sure he could have played the Duke as an old man without difficultly. Instead we get the round-faced Jacobi, unrecognizable as the same man.Lia Williams and Geraldine Chaplin as the Duchess of Windsor. Both were good. I saw no need to re-cast the role. As with Jennings, Williams would have been fine as the older Duchess.Greg Wise and Charles Dance as Lord Mountbatten. I thought both hit the mark. Wise was smoother, Dance more imposing, which seemed a little more appropriate.Mathew Goode and Ben Daniels as Anthony Armstrong-Jones. Goode played him as a reserved, rather arrogant cultural snob who for unknown reasons, married into the royal family and must have immediately regretted it. Daniels is a much more charming and charismatic performer who seems to dominate every scene he is in just by his presence. He seems much more like the type of person who could get people to pose for him and worm his way into the royal family. And I'd just rather see him act than the other guy.",0,1,1,0,0,-999,0

The Crown,"This series is very character driven and the story is linked to the history of Britain from the mid-20th century to the present. Elizabeth II, the British monarch since 1952, belongs to both centuries. Many of us want to learn about the young woman who became Queen and how she fared in those early years of her reign in the 1950's, coping with personal conflicts, and learning the job that she inherited on the death of her 56 year old father. This first season did not disappoint me. The pace was slow at first but I was soon drawn into the events of the period. Claire Foy captures the beauty and charm of the young Queen. On a visit to Africa with her husband, she finds out that her father has died and she is immediately proclaimed Queen. The turn of events is very starkly projected onto our television screen. The king's funeral follows. Thrust upon the world stage, with advisors and Palace staff, we follow her through her Coronation and then a constitutional crisis involving Princess Margaret, her younger sister. We see the Queen Mother coping with grief from the death of her husband, the loss of her home and title. The Queen's husband, Phillip, an ambitious young man, sets aside his naval career and plays the supporting role to his wife. Elizabeth tries to treat him as an equal but it seems there is no way as the Prince Consort, to take up a career. Then, there was the Duke of Windsor, formerly King Edward VIII, who shows up seeking more money to finance his lavish lifestyle and that of his wife. Matt Smith performed the energetic and athletic Prince Phillip, who became disillusioned with his limited role; Dame Eileen Atkins, as the grandmother, Queen Mary, is outstanding; Victoria Hamilton as the Queen Mother seems very distant, and not in keeping with the gracious Queen Mother who was so active in her public role; the role of the Duke of Windsor was magnificently performed by Alex Jennings; John Lithgow, in the role of Winston Churchill, seemed out of his comfort zone (Timothy West...maybe too old now, would have been a better choice); Jeremy Northam was very suited to Anthony Eden, the former Foreign Minister, who was ailing but tried to work with the Queen over the Princess Margaret affair and then tried unsuccessfully to deal with Egyptian President Nasser; Jared Harris didn't look at all like King George VI but he was very convincing in the role of the ill-fated king who took over from his brother, presided over victory in World War II and died at age 56. Despite it's shortcomings, it is great television viewing for those with an interest in the evolution of the Royal Family under Elizabeth II.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1

The Crown,"I cannot explain why I like this show so much. I suppose it reaches into the unconscious mind in a way that is hard to describe - much like a painting of a place I've never been to and will never see in person - yet the art draws me in and makes me want to learn more. The story is about Queen Elizabeth II when she gets the throne - and as I watch I find it truly amazing that she has been the queen since the 1950's. The show has flawless sets, costumes, lights, acting, writing. Jarred Harris is perfect as Elizabeth's father - the flashback scenes with him are dynamic. The music is breathtaking - and for whatever reason - the show is oddly perfect. But I should ad - much of the suffering humankind has endured over the last five hundred years is in large part due to the greed and barbarism of the colonial rulers - and this family has profited in excessive privilege when so many have suffered. So for that - I dock this story points for glorifying them on a pedestal that is perhaps too high.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1
The Crown,"My Review. The Crown - Season 4.
Screening On. Netflix
Mr Score 8/10I have to give the latest Season of The Crown a high score because of the superb Production values and most of the performances. I even enjoyed Olivia Coleman as Queen Elizabeth 11 in this series much more than Series 3 .
Season 3 covered the years 1964 to 1977 and The Queen was still very beautiful at 38 years old so the physical appearance of Olivia Coleman in series three was a bridge to far for me to cross. I couldn't possibly imagine that the beautiful Claire Foy that we left in 1964 had morphed into the frumpy caricature that we saw in Season 3 and I think Olivia Coleman is a splendid actress, just not right in Series 2.This season however with the Political and personal issues being dealt with in the story Olivia comes up Trumps ( oh how that word has changed for me ) and looks much more like Her Majesty.
I can't say the same for an actress I usually like but who think is entirely miscast in The Crown Helena Bonham Carter as Princess Margaret the Queens sister is entirely wrong and miscast her histrionics real or imagined are suitable more for a backroom bar than Buckingham Palace.
Princess Margaret was certainly a victim of "" The Royal ""machine and was made very unhappy by being robbed of a love match marriage and the chance of happiness yes In later life she may have been a party girl but Helena Bonham Carter plays her like a petulant common waste of space rich girl who achieved very little.
Princess Margaret's great enthusiasms were music and ballet. In 1957, the same year that she was made an Honorary Doctor of Music of London University, she became the first President of the Royal Ballet, The Queen serving as Patron; she was also President of the Sadler's Wells Foundation . Princess Margaret took a full share in the Royal Family's many public activities and showed particular interest in the broad field of welfare work. Many of the 80-plus organisations of which she was Patron or President are concerned with activities for young people, children's well-being and caring for sick people.
I'm as guilty as anyone and enjoy a good Soap Opera but when many of the characters including their children are still alive ,especially Her Majesty The Queen and are sitting targets unable to comment on the many inaccuracies and the imagined interactions that Peter Morgan depicts in ""The Crown "" I frankly wish they had waited till her departure from this world.
While watching the Crown I thought of how the Royal Family of Thailand would react to a similar treatment of their dynasty. It would be off with their heads and executions the day after the first episode ,aren't we fortunate to have free press .
There are many people involved in this top Rating series becoming very very wealthy on the life experiences of our current monarch and her family . It's easy money and no wonder the Production is lavish and beautiful to watch .
However not a brass cent in Royalties would be accepted by the cast of characters that Peter Morgan and his ten script writers give their ""The Dallas at The Palace Soap Opera treatment .""
I enjoyed The Crown series 4 for the performances especially Gillian Anderson as Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher she is superb and Emma Corin is astonishing at times you feel Princess Diana has risen again .
I'm in conflict about the ethics and inaccuracy about some of the events and the way many of the great qualities and hard work of The Royal Family are ignored .
I treat The Crown as an Uptown Downton Abbey more fiction than fact very loosely based on real events and a script that is excellent as an adaptation of real events and imagined conversations that can and probably never will be verified.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1
The Crown,"I am not a royalist by any means. In fact, I often wonder why kings and queens exist in the 21st century. I marvel that they don't come to their senses themselves and join the human race as it is. So, I did balk at watching this Netflix offering at first.I am glad I dipped my toe in by watching the first episode. I was immediately seduced by the richness of its writing, its editing, its presentation and its talent. I was also rewarded with a balanced view of the monarchy as institution vs. personality. Flawed and tortured human beings poured into rigid traditional roles. Claire Foy is simply remarkable. Matt Smith is a perfect foil. Victoria Hamilton and Eileen Atkins provide weighty and humorous ballast. The cast is too deep to acknowledge individually here, but any fan of British productions will be wowed. Alex Jennings deserves mention as David, Duke of Windsor. Vanessa Kirby shines as Princess Margaret.Well worth a Netflix binge. We highly recommend it.",1,1,0,0,0,1,1
The Crown,"The Crown boasts no action sequences or big movie stars, and yet it is one of the most expensive shows of all time. Why? Because of the sheer attention to detail. Aside from the fully historically accurate costumes and locations, the show is just gorgeous to look at. The lighting, the cinematography, and everything else visual about it is on point. It's quite apparent none of that money went to waste.The show doesn't just look gorgeous, though. It is also compelling, well written, and well performed. In fact, almost every element is perfectly executed, which means that no single one stands out above the rest, but rather they work in harmony. And that is the show's greatest success; the fact that it all comes together smoothly into a neat, binge-able, high quality package.Mind you, the reason I enjoy the Crown so much is that I knew what to expect when I went into it. This is NOT a fast-paced, action-packed, edge-of-your-seat experience. It is a character drama about the royal family. It runs at a slow pace. Yet it is gripping all the same. That's why it is so good to know that Netflix made such a large investment in this series; they're taking chances and funding original and unusual things in an era when Hollywood is afraid to do anything that isn't already an existing intellectual property. I hope that the Crown blows up like Stranger Things. I hope it gets all the attention it deserves.",1,1,1,1,1,1,0

The show is focused on her and Philip and hands down have perfect chemistry towards each other. The show revolves around the queen... Now jump ahead to season 3... which I give a rating of 4Netflix changed every character and now the show is a joke. We as viewers get use to style of the show and now you change it all up and for what??? For better ratings??? Well you won't get that now that's for sure. The show now has all kinds of small side stories that nobody cares about let alone want to watch.

The Crown,"Plot summary: A shy young woman, descended from a long line of hardworking German immigrants, doesn't feel quite ready to take over the family business. The first season, scripted by the brilliant Peter Morgan (""The Queen""), covers only the first few years of the young queen's reign, and this big canvas, like a painting by Breughel or Bosch (but with nicer furniture!), allows for a tight focus on some tiny but revealing details; I especially liked the episode in which ER II, who's only been taught French, deportment and the British constitution, uses her expert knowledge of the latter to outfox the palace HR department (it's complicated) and hires a tutor to teach her, among other things, how the H-bomb works. The cast is just about perfect, and Morgan's done an amazing job of bringing these remote, puppetlike figures (especially so for those of us who grew up during that era) to life in a convincing way. Over the course of ten episodes, we see Claire Foy's soft, expressive face transformed into an impassive mask of authority (perhaps the makeup artists deserve some credit here). Mike ""Dr. Who"" Smith is especially impressive as a slightly feral Prince Phillip, likewise Jared Harris as a menschy George VI, and John Lithgow (6′4˝) totally crushes it as a supersize Winston Churchill (5′6˝). It's all pretty great. Most of the drama consists of intense two-shot interactions in overdecorated rooms, but there's plenty of royal pageantry, plus excursions to Kenya and Australia (both played by South Africa, btw) and various primo huntin', shootin' and fishin' spots. On to season two! We're eager to see if Princess Margaret really had it off with Jagger during the 60s!",1,1,1,0,1,1,0
How the Grinch Stole Christmas,"Other than Babe: Pig in the City and Santa Clause Conquers the Martians, I can't think of a more detestable kids pic than this. I hated Jim Carey and I hate Dr. Seuss' widow for authorizing this pile of #@@%!!! AND THEN SAYING ""This is exactly the sort of film my husband would have made"". Yeah, well maybe after he had an aneurysm!! Come on, lady. Just be truthful and instead say ""it's dog drool and the Doc is spinning in his grave like a rotisserie--BUT MAN WILL YA' LOOK AT ALL THE MONEY THEY GAVE ME?!?!?!??"".I base this on the basic fact that the entire message of the book and wonderful TV special is: The GRINCH HATES XMAS and the People of Whoville know the REAL reason and joy of the holiday. Now with this crappy movie it's: The Grinch rightfully hates XMAS because it's been over-commercialized by the selfish people of Whoville. Huh?!?!?! This is the complete OPPOSITE of Seuss' vision and his widow has the nerve to say it was what HE wanted?!?! This was the most overblown and over-hyped movie. With $10000000000000 dollars spent on advertising and marketing (and $6.79 for writing), it's no wonder the movie made money!!! Kids can't help but see Grinch paraphernalia EVERYWHERE and demand to see the movie. BUT, to the parents of Planet Earth we have a solution to movies like this---Tell your kids NO!!!!! Then take them for a walk or go fishing or beat each other senseless with tire irons--it would STILL be better than going to see bloated MEGA-crap like this!UPDATE: I have an Italian friend who likes the film. When we talked about it, I understood why. He had never read the book nor seen the wonderful cartoon versions--and the message in them is the exact opposite of this movie. So, if you haven't seen the cartoon or read the book, this could be a nice film to watch....but if you HAVE and loved them like I did as a child, the film is an insult.",-1,0,1,0,0,-999,0
How the Grinch Stole Christmas,"Of course it isn't as good as the animated classic, an immensely charming, beautifully animated gem, that is a family Christmas favourite. I will admit I was a bit sceptical of the remake, but other than some slow scenes in the middle half and a patchy script, this film is surprisingly good. Honestly if you thought this is terrible, and I completely respect anyone who thinks that, I warn you Cat in the Hat was much worse, and gets my vote as the worst Dr Seuss adaptation ever. How The Grinch stole Christmas is very colourful, with great set design, and an unrecognisable Jim Carrey was terrific as the Grinch, he was actually really funny, not like Mike Myers who was miscast as the cat in Cat in The Hat. Everyone else was fine too, particularly the girl, and while he is no Boris Karloff Antony Hopkins does a good job as the narrator. The script is patchy in places, but there are a number of very funny bits, and it was nice having some character context about the Grinch. All in all, a colourful, well performed film, not as good as the 1966 animated classic,and flawed it is, but actually one of the better Dr Seuss adaptations. 8/10 Bethany Cox",1,1,0,1,1,1,0
How the Grinch Stole Christmas,"With such an iconic 1966 animated 1/2 hour special, it's hard to imagine a reason to reimagine it as a live action movie. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. I'm not particularly angry or hate this. It's just that I couldn't stop asking Why? This one gives a backstory to the origin of the Grinch. He gets delivered by mistake to Whoville. The kids bully him because of his looks. In frustration, he runs away to live on the mountain. Now he is a fully grown loner. Cindy Lou Who (Taylor Momsen) is searching for the meaning of Christmas. She tries to see the good in the Grinch, and keeps trying to bring the spirit of Christmas to him. But the Grinch just can't get into the spirit.I don't have a big problem with the additional backstory or the greater role for Cindy Lou Who. That's to be expected for an expanded Grinch. And Taylor Momsen is a perfectly good child actor. But none of it excites me. The visual design is again expected but without the outlandishness of 'The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T.' for instance. However it is still great once we get to the last part where the Grinch tries to steal Christmas. All the sentiments are there voiced especially by Cindy Lou Who's father. That part still works. Nothing can change that.",0,0,1,1,0,-999,0
How the Grinch Stole Christmas,"Jim Carrey is really fun, though his canon does include some clunkers. I really wanted to like this film, but with all the bells and whistles and Carrey's mugging, it just got dull. Because it is from the Grinch's perspective, the events seem cruel. The humor is juvenile and unoriginal. It has that anything-for-a-laugh being to it. What carries it to a point is that it is a good story. But it is not enough. I guess when someone does a sequel, even if it is a feature film updating a cartoon, it needs to take it to the next level, to put some new and original spin on it. I'm not even saying it's terrible; I give it a six. But a few days after seeing it, I really took nothing with me.",0,1,0,0,0,1,0
How the Grinch Stole Christmas,"In the land of Whoville everyone loves Christmas and count down the whole year until that wonderful time. However just outside Whoville lives the Grinch, a green hairy twisted creature that hates, and always has hated, Christmas and was rejected by the Who's as a child. A young girl from Whoville sets out to befriend the Grinch and help him find his love of Christmas but, when it goes wrong early on, the Grinch becomes even more rotten and plans to ruin it for everyone.I have never read the book or seen the original animated version of this story, but I do enjoy a bit of Dr Seuss and was worried about how such imagination would be filled out on the screen. The film actually manages it very well and the whole film has the look of the books, even if it lacks soul at times. The plot is stretched out to the running time and could have easily been shorter and punchier, but at heart it is a good little moral that is good from Christmas time.However, aside from the look of the film, the main reason that the film works is Jim Carrey. I cannot think of another actor who could have pulled off this role as well as he did. He is manic and really funny although I imagine that if you dislike him and his antics that you'd hate the film totally. I'm on the fence about him but I did enjoy him here. Momsen is OK but really just a `cute kid' and, while the support cast has quite a few famous faces, they don't make much of an impact under the makeup and the film is left to Carrey to save it - which he happily does.Overall this film is a little too long and padded out, but while Carrey is onscreen it seems to go pretty fast due to his hyper acting and comedy antics. However, it's Christmas and it has a nice message while not totally giving in to syrupy sentiment (thanks again to manic Carrey) and it's just perfect for kids and adults at Christmas time.",0,0,-1,0,0,-999,0

How the Grinch Stole Christmas,"During his heyday as a comic film star, it was expected that a Jim Carey movie would be over-the-top with his antics, especially if he was playing a milquetoast character who suddenly got some gumption to stop being picked on. With ""The Grinch"" and ""The Mask"", Carey went overboard with the antics, reminding me of that attention seeking kid who could break people up laughing with their silly faces and funny voices but never knew when to stop. In other words, he's perfect for roles like this, yet after a while it can become pretty tiring.As the Grinch, he gives an over cafineated performance, frenetic and sly, barely stopping to get a breath. Of course a lot of that is in the makeup and costume, special effects and the editing, but no one else in 2000 could play that role. This isn't the quiet menace of the Boris Karloff cartoon but something a lot more complex, some of which works and some of which can be eye rolling.The direction by Ron Howard is decent but there's so much going on that you may feel forced to watch it every other Christmas or so to gather it all up. It's beautiful to look at and often funny (especially his love of raw onions), but there's a bit of cloying nonsense with the character of Cindy Lou Who, unfortunately not always easy to understand, especially when she sings.Bill Irwin, Christine Baranski and Jeffrey Tambor provide a few of the familiar faces with Anthony Hopkins almost sounding like Karloff. This must have been a magical set to see for the first time for those involved, and certainly the first viewing can bring on a lot of ooh's and ah's. The town of Whoville though isn't presented as the perfect Christmas town even though it's obvious their favorite holiday. Certain individuals are grinches in their own right. Not bad for an occasional viewing (my third in 20 years), but not one I'd make a Christmas tradition.",1,1,1,0,1,1,0
How the Grinch Stole Christmas,"For anyone not enamoured by the spirit of Christmas, they will understand the cynic in disguise. Or you can just call him Grinch.

I watched this back to back with the newer Grinch (and saw on imdb there is another Grinch movie with Bela Lugosi? Another one for the have to watch someday list) and it made it obvious that this is not as good as the newer version - at least to me.Having said all that, the movie is still funny and just for Carey it really is more than worthwhile. I guess some watch it every year, so depending how your emotional connection to it is ... otherwise I'd suggest go with the new and entirely animated one.",0,1,0,-999,0,1,0
How the Grinch Stole Christmas,"Big budget remake of the classic cartoon about a creature (Jim Carrey) intent on stealing Christmas.I had rather low expectations for this one... not sure why, as it turned out to be quite good. I just wanted to add a few thoughts here.First of all, Taylor Momsen nailed the Cindy Lou Who part. She has gone on to bigger, better things (""Gossip Girl"") and good for her. Second, Ron Howard nailed the look of a Seussian world. The faces, the architecture, it all seems so right and I think the good doctor would have approved. I heard that Tim Burton was approached to direct, and I think he would have done a fine job, but how do you beat this? And last, Jim Carrey. Wow. He has had some good and bad career decisions, and this has to be among his best. The physical comedy, the improvised jokes, it was like the role he was born to play. The other choices were Jack Nicholson and Eddie Murphy. Nicholson could possibly have done it ten years earlier, but did he have that range of motion in 2000? And Eddie Murphy? Maybe, maybe not. This was a Carrey role inside and out.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1
How the Grinch Stole Christmas,"I found this a very entertaining small kids movie that actually is geared more for adults with a lot of jokes and humor only they would understand. A few things are inappropriate for the kiddies, but just a few. Othewise, ""The Grinch"" (Jim Carrey) cracks so many jokes you can't keep up with them all, ranging from sexual to cultural to insider-Hollywood to racial.The film is very colorful and looks great on DVD. The little girl in here, ""Cindy Lou Who"" (Taylor Momsen) is really cute and the costumes and hairdos of the little people in here are fun to view. Anthony Hopkins' voice is pleasing, too, so having his narrate this elevates the movie further.

How the Grinch Stole Christmas,"This was the second version of the famous story by Dr. Suess, following the 1966 Chuck Jones/Boris Karloff cartoon, a big-budget live action adaptation, produced by Brian Grazer, directed by Ron Howard (Splash, Parenthood, Ransom, A Beautiful Mind). Basically the Whos down in Whoville are preparing for Christmas, everyone is excited to be buying gifts, decorations and food. Seven-year-old Cindy Lou Who (Taylor Momsen) feels however everyone is missing the point about Christmas, going overboard with festive items, rather than personal relationships. While on top of Mount Crumpit lives the hairy, green creature the Grinch (Golden Globe nominated Jim Carrey), he is feared by all the townspeople, he has a heart two sizes too small, and he really hates Christmas. Cindy Lou encounters the Grinch when he comes down the mountain into town to create trouble in the Post Office, she is initially scared, until he reluctantly saves her from being crushed in a packaging machine. She becomes curious about the Grinch, and asks townspeople about his history, she asks many people in town what they know about him. The Grinch had a tragic past, as a baby he was adopted by two spinsters, he showed sadistic tendencies as a child, but was not cruel as he would later become. In school, the eight-year-old Grinch (Josh Ryan Evans) had a crush on classmate Martha May Whovier (Landry Allbright), but his rival Augustus May Who (Ben Bookbinder) teased him about his hairiness. One year, the Grinch makes Martha a gift, he also attempts to shave his face, the next day his classmates laugh at him for his face cuts, he loses his temper, destroys the gift and trashes the classroom, and exiled himself to the top of Mount Crumpit, never to be seen again. Touched by this story, Cindy Lou decides to nominate the Grinch to be the Christmas Whobilation ""Holiday Cheermeister"", to the displeasure of Augustus May Who, now the mayor of Whoville. She climbs to the top of Mount Crumpit and invites the Grinch to the Whobilation, he initially declines, but reconsiders hearing about an award, and that Martha May (Christine Baranski) will be at the celebration. As Cheermeister, the Grinch endures wearing an ugly sweater and judging all the Whos' Christmas food concoctions, but he enjoys being unsportsmanlike and beating children in the competitions. The Mayor reminds the Grinch of his childhood humiliation, giving him an electric shaver as a present, and publicly proposing marriage to Martha May, and offering her a new car on the side. In response, the Grinch berates the Whos about the Christmas festivities, saying it is all about the gifts, most will end up in the garbage which is dumped on Mount Crumpit near his home. He proceeds to ruin the party, burning down the town Christmas tree and causing chaos. Cindy Lou is shamed by the Mayor, but the Whos have a spare tree, which they put up after the Grinch leaves. The Grinch wants Christmas to end once and for all, it is when he sees his dog Max (Kelley, voiced by Frank Welker) with snow on his face, like the beard of Santa Claus, he gets a wonderful, awful idea. He concocts a plan to steal all the Christmas presents, decorations and food from the Whos, he creates a Santa Claus suit and hat, building a powered sleigh, and sticking an antler on Max's head to become a reindeer. The first house the Grinch goes to is Cindy Lou's house, she catches him as he is stealing the Christmas tree, but he lies to her, as Santa, that he is taking it to be fixed at his workshop. The Grinch continues house to house stealing everything Christmassy, packing it into a bag in the back of the sleigh, and gets it back to the top of Mount Crumpit, ready to dump it. The Grinch listens out for the cries of the Whos when they wake up on Christmas morning, the Mayor blames Cindy Lou for what the Grinch has done, but her father Lou Lou Who (Bill Irwin) defends her, saying that Christmas is not all about the gifts, it is about family. Before the Grinch pushes the sleigh of Christmas goods off the edge of the cliff, he hears the happy singing of the Whos, he is puzzled that he has not stopped Christmas from coming. Then he realises, Christmas means more than judt what comes from a store, it means a little bit more, and in this moment, his heart grows three sizes. He sees the sleigh is about to fall from the mountain, he is unable to stop it, but then he sees Cindy Lou on top of the load, this motivates him to save not just the gifts but a life, he finds the strength to lift the sleigh. The Grinch and Cindy Lou ride the sleigh back to town to return the gifts, the Grinch confesses to stealing Christmas and apologises, surrendering himself to the police. Officer Wholihan (Jim Meskimen) lets him go, and Martha May turns down the Mayor's proposal, handing back his diamond ring, as heart belongs to the Grinch. In the end, the Grinch joins Cindy Lou and all the Whos in a singalong, and he has the honour of carving the roast beast for the large feast. Narrated by Sir Anthony Hopkins, also starring Molly Shannon as Betty Lou Who, Clint Howard (Ron's brother) as Whobris, Mindy Sterling as Clarnella, Rachel Winfree as Rose, Rance Howard (Ron's father) as Elderly Timekeeper, Jeremy Howard as Drew Lou Who, T.J. Thyne as Stu Lou Who, Deep Roy as Post Office Clerk, Rain Pryor (Richard's daughter) as Shopper, Verne Troyer as Band Member, Rick Baker as Puppeteer, Bryce Dallas Howard as Surprised Who and Ron Howard as Whoville Townsperson. Carrey is almost unrecognisable under the makeup as the hairy, green pest, he really laps up being mean and causing havoc, Momsen is cute, and Tambor and Baranski do their parts well, and the narration by Hopkins is nice. It sticks to the basic story of the mountain dweller who hates everything festive and plans to steal it, the extension seeing the lead creature's past, why he hates Christmas and other bits and pieces works, it deserved the awards for brilliant makeup for Carrey in his green getup and everything with their noses, the costumes, sets and props are likeably weird, kooky and colourful, and Carrey sings an amusing version of ""You're a Mean One, Mr. Grinch"", it is dark in moments and might be a little much for children, but you will find yourself laughing a lot, and feel the Christmas spirit, a wondeful seasonal fantasy comedy. It won the Oscar for Best Makeup, and it was nominated for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration and Best Costume Design, and it won the BAFTA for Best Make Up/Hair. Jim Carrey was number 47 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars. Very good!",1,1,1,1,1,1,1
How the Grinch Stole Christmas,"Despite the misgivings one may initially have about Hollywood turning the still-satisfying animated TV special from Dr. Seuss' book into a big-budget live-action feature, fear not over the look of the piece. Director Ron Howard and his artists have really captured the visual essence of the classic show, and one couldn't possibly hope for a better-looking movie based upon a Seuss story. Jim Carrey is marvelously cast as the Grinch, a green, furry, Christmas-hating malcontent who lives atop a snowy hill overlooking Whoville, although the inhabitants of Whoville present a problem. With make-up designs causing everyone to resemble relatives of Wallace Shawn, distinctive (or likable) personalities were apparently difficult to come by. In expanding this whole scenario, screenwriters Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman were unable to retain the angelic (some may argue, cloying) passivity in Whoville. We now get a Mayor who's a self-serving jerk, a Christmas lights contest between neighbors, and children who laugh and jeer at a moppet version of the Grinch in a very odd flashback sequence. Howard's attentions as a filmmaker begin to wander after a promising opening; he becomes exhausted by the material itself--the bombast wears him out--perhaps causing a few of his quieter moments to flag (particularly an awful sequence with Carrey having fun with his echo, later munching on shattered glass). Bits and pieces work crazy magic, though Howard is no Tim Burton and doesn't always grasp the deliciousness in the macabre undermining (he's too anxious to be funny). Anthony Hopkins narrates in commendable fashion, and there are some marvelous scenes, but interest for adults should wane after the first hour. ** from ****",1,1,1,1,1,1,1
How the Grinch Stole Christmas,"It's amazing all that goes on, inside a normal snowflake! I found the DVD of this movie on the shelves of my local county library, and brought it home to watch with my 14-year-old neighbors, Emily and Natalie. Jim Carrey is perfect as the Grinch. It's a story that has been around for a long time, everyone knows it. The critic Ebert describes the movie fairly accurately, but gives it a lower rating than I do. Aside from Carrey, I especially enjoyed Bill Irwin, a virtually unknown and underrated actor who has great body movements and facial expressions. The DVD is of course sharp and colorful with great 5.1 sound. It also has a number of very nice extras for those of us who like to go behind the scenes to see how a film was made.

Especially because not only does the film team up to great film people- Actor Jim Carrey and producer/director Ron Howard, the makeup effects in this film is the best I've seen in years. It is simply amazing craftwork done on Jim Carrey as he is enveloped in the Grinch caharcter, and even though you can't see him exactly, his personality, voice and soul is shining through at all times. What also attracted me to the movie is that it takes a look at The Grinch in a way that you understand his phsyche. If you were to read the book or watch the 1966 TV cartoon (which was also fun), all you would see is the basics (and or the third act of this film). But in most of the film, we see how the grinch has been transformed into an antihero and how he may be mad outside, but inside, he has a heart (even if it's 2 sizes to small). But the seriousness beside, this film is pure fun. It's consistently funny as we look at Carrey use his grinch to make the audience yuckle up. And it works.

How the Grinch Stole Christmas,"Spoilers herein.Seuss's charm came from minimalism, a unique sort of theatricality that could be filled in by the reader/listener according to the sophistication of their own imagination.It was a minimalism in the story. Only one simple thread around which you could impute your own world. Trampled on here with all sorts of extra stuff as if our own minds didn't world.It was minimalism in the verse. Some scant remnant of that remains, buried deep in ordinary, vapid dialog.But most of all it was minimalism in the drawings. Those drawings were an anti art nouveau which started clean but ended excessively ornamented. Each line was a joke on itself, a self-referential comment on how the mind likes to take the simplest thing and can't help from elaborating until human limits are reached.His homeopathic style depends on this phenomenon and his simultaneous joke about it.

How the Grinch Stole Christmas,"A lot of money was spent in turning this Ron Howard production into a full-length feature with JIM CARREY as ""The Grinch,"" but I'll take the 1966 animated version any day over this overstuffed fantasy.The director obviously gave Carrey license to ""go for it"" with some moments of comedy enough to produce a few chuckles, but Carrey's lack of restraint reaches manic proportions before the film is half over and his sickly green and grotesque make-up is an unappetizing sight to behold in those huge close-ups. The film (at all times) strains too hard to be a quirky imitation of the original Dr. Seuss cartoon and is simply not up to the job. It's a mess. Furthermore, none of the supporting characters are more than mildly entertaining. TAYLOR MOMSEN is a lovely little girl but she can't sing and she substitutes a look of placid, wide-eyed wonder for acting while Carrey heats up the screen with his overacted mugging. CHRISTINE BARANSKI has a flair for comedy but she's been seen to much better advantage in other roles and looks more than mildly uncomfortable as the woman secretly in love with ""The Grinch."" Actually, most of the time she looks as though she can barely tolerate looking at him.There's a perky background score, some over-luxurious sets, some ghastly looking costumes for the Whoville residents, and the overall feeling one gets is that the slim plot has been expanded to the point where it overstays its welcome. The over stuffing doesn't just apply to the sets and costumes and special effects. The script tries to set up a flashback of ""how"" the Grinch became what he is, but it has a dulling effect that only succeeds in slowing down the ponderous pace of the film's last hourThe script rightfully won a ""Razzie"" as worst of the year, so the blame can't be placed entirely on director or star. My advice: If you want to do justice to Dr. Seuss, do it with animation and not live actors.Summing up: Not a shred of charm. It's as if ""Opie"" meets Tim Burton.",-1,0,0,-1,-1,-999,-1
How the Grinch Stole Christmas,"This is a live-action adaptation of the Dr. Seuss novella, following the classic 1966 animated short by Chuck Jones (narrated by horror icon Boris Karloff); for the record, I own a copy of both the latter and the earlier Stanley Kramer production of THE 5,000 FINGERS OF DR. T (1953) in my collection. This remake, on the other hand, features the voice of a bored-sounding Anthony Hopkins. The Grinch (actually the title of the copy I watched, shown on local TV) is an ideal role for the facial contortions and over-the-top antics of Jim Carrey. He is a hairy creature in the fictional town of Whoville (whose 'normal' inhabitants are elfish in appearance).They love Christmas and celebrate it in grand fashion, but The Grinch does not since he had always been given the cold shoulder at this time of year in view of his unusual appearance. Consequently, he has gone to live by himself in the mountains (attacking occasional trespassers from town) but a little girl feels pity on The Grinch and determines to help him (even carrying out a survey around town to learn what the townsfolk really think of him!). When a prize for the most prominent personality is to be handed out, she nominates The Grinch, even if the Mayor (the latter's arch-enemy and contender for the hand of the town belle) expects it to be given to himself. The girl convinces The Grinch to accept but, when the ceremony turns unpleasant – with the people of Whoville making fun of him a' la The Hunchback Of Notre Dame – he decides to take revenge by disrupting their Christmas festivities (the premise, then, is very similar to the recently-viewed THE Christmas THAT ALMOST WASN'T {1966})!What he does is wear the traditional Santa Claus clothing and, rather than delivering presents as he is supposed to, The Grinch goes round the Whoville houses on Christmas Eve to steal the gifts ready to be opened the next day! However, his triumph is short-lived as the townsfolk realize – once again, thanks to the girl – that Christmas is essentially a time of solidarity but, of course, this being at heart a morality play, The Grinch is himself reformed and finally accepted into the town's fold. Though reasonably engaging (the little girl's sincere portrayal helps a lot in this regard), occasionally funny (for instance, The Grinch dresses his dog like a reindeer on his nefarious expedition!) and undeniably good to look at (highlighted by the imaginative production design of the Whoville locale), this still makes for little more than a kiddie movie. Incidentally, Carrey would later 'star' in that other Yuletide favorite A Christmas CAROL (2009), which I also included in my schedule for this season.",1,1,1,0,1,1,0
How the Grinch Stole Christmas,"Overproduced spectacle that misses the point of the original story and TV special. If you had to do this film (and you didn't) at least get the point of the story right instead of bastardizing Dr. Seuss' message. Jim Carrey is obnoxious and gave me a headache. Taylor Momsen is the best part as Cindy Lou Who, although I miss the adorable two year old from the original. This Cindy Lou is a typical ""smarter than all the grown-ups"" kid like you only see in movies. Still, overly precocious or not, she's one of the few sweet parts of an otherwise charmless film. Garish sets and dark colors are a turn-off. See the original cartoon instead. It will save you a lot of time and you will come away much happier.",-1,0,-1,-1,0,-999,-1
How the Grinch Stole Christmas,"I already loved ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" when it was released and I'm still loving it now, 5 years later. Still lots of people seem to disagree with my opinion and this movie never really had received much love at the time it came out.Sure, the movie is over-the-top and campy but that at the very same is also the reason why this movie is so charming and fun to watch. All of the sets, costumes and characters are done perfectly over-the-top in a fun way, without ever becoming truly ridicules. It's a visually spectacular movie to watch. It's a campy movie making at its very best! Director Ron Howard really surprises with this fun little Christmas movie.Main reason why the movie works and why it's so much fun to watch is Jim Carrey as the Grinch. He truly carries the movie with his good and fun role. He is of course helped by the convincing make-up, which also received an Academy Award. Of course if you're a Jim Carrey hater you shouldn't even think about watching this movie. This movie is really his movie and he makes it all work and so much fun to watch. Other fun and memorable roles are being played by Jeffrey Tambor, Clint Howard and Josh Ryan Evans as the young Grinch.The movie has a good morale but it is all a bit sappy to me. Perhaps it's because I'm Dutch and we don't really celebrate Christmas that enthusiastic and big here, as in the United States or England. For me the movie was simply fun and entertaining and the morale just left me quite cold to be honest.The musical score by James Horner is good and fun, even though it's your average every day Horner stuff, it still all works perfectly for the movie and helps to make some of the scene's work.Perfect Christmas entertainment.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",1,1,1,1,1,1,1
How the Grinch Stole Christmas,"Ron Howard's big screen version of the beloved Christmas book is one of the few modern Christmas 'classics' (and I use this word loosely) that we have.For me though it's not that great. The visuals are great, the story well adapted, but it didn't do a lot for me.Jim Carrey is given full reign to mug and clown around, with his own brand of humour not always hitting the spot. Christine Baranski is the best of the various supporting players.So, sorry, for me this is not a Christmas classic. Just another fairly average attempt at being one.",-1,-1,1,0,0,-999,1
How the Grinch Stole Christmas,"DR. SEUSS' HOW THE GRINCH STOLE CHRISTMAS (2000) ***1/2 Jim Carrey, Jeffrey Tambor, Christine Baranski, Bill Irwin, Molly Shannon, Taylor Momsen, Clint Howard, Anthony Hopkins (narrator) (Dir: Ron Howard)Say what you will about Jim Carrey, but the man may be giving James Brown as The Hardest Working Man in Show Business in the latest of his tailor-made impersonations in his ongoing building to his big screen legacy as the titular, beloved grump that has entertained children of all ages for .well, all ages. Carrey, buried under all that wonderfully captured pear-shaped, mint colored fuzzy costume and scary affective make-up by wizard Rick Baker, gives all the gusto he can muster in making himself recognizable and making the iconic character a calling to his own brand of off-the-wall humor, riffing here and there, as Whoville's resident Sasquatch of sort. As the perennial Christmas season is in full bloom in the hamlet of Whos, all bustling in their eye-candy spectacular habitat of swirling, gravity defying environs and pastel colored schematics, it is tiny Cindy Lou Who (the adorable Momsen, fitted with chipmunk buck teeth) that questions why the nasty, ill-tempered outcast became the monster they all fear and have avoided dealing with for so many years. After all, it seems to her that the holiday is apparently more than the giddy rush of giving multi-colored gift-wrapped presents and stringing thousands of blinking lights across rooftops to depict the true meaning of the season. The Grinch makes no bones about his loathing for the soppy, sentimental denizens below from his garbage heaped mountain topped domain that he shares only with his skeptical, long-suffering mutt, Max. But even he begins to doubt his own behavior after several encounters with the well-meaning tiny Who, Cindy, who doesn't take him seriously at all. The script, adapted by Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman, nips and tucks the epic poem by the late great Seuss but allows its star to improvise and give a whirling dervish performance with much energy to spare not seen since his other green-faced incarnation of the party happy hero in `The Mask'. His voice is perhaps his best instrument inhabiting the original narrator Boris Karloff who served double duty in turn as the Grinch's speaking inflections as well as a pinch of Richard Nixon, Edward G. Robinson and dare I say Jimmy Stewart with a toothache. His eyes, hidden under reportedly painful yellow contact lenses, also get a full work out in his gleefully malevolent/benevolent turn here letting the audience in on what a ball he is having even if he is suffering for his art. Chuck Jones, who animated the television classic, was smart enough to have the ugly humbug sublime with the accent of a raised eyebrow and half-lidded indifference sustainingself-loathing rage that Carrey takes to the next level. The subplot flashback depicting The Grinch as a child ostracized by the nasty Whos in school is heart-breakingly familiar to anyone who ever endured ridicule for being `different' and seems a bit heavy-handed but the point is clearly ironed out to full effect in getting why The Grinch stole Christmas. Kudos to director Howard, who at first seems out of his element, but you'd have to go way back to `Willow' to recollect his keen observation that production design is a must in telling the tale equally as well as the tale worth being filmed. He has that in spades with a wonderfully true-to-form lifting from the book and the tv special with his team of Michael Croenblith's set designs, cinematographer Don Peterman's dark yet cheery on the edges photography and again Baker's memorable make-up (even if the Who's pig-snouted faces are a bit unsettling at first). The film also works to its seemingly adult overview with Carrey's side-of-the mouth WC Fields delivery of one-liners, double entendres and his slapstick hootenanny antics on full display here. You'd have to be a Scrooge not to enjoy this sugary candy cane of a movie.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1
How the Grinch Stole Christmas,"Ron Howard, who never met a story he couldn't screw up, takes the delightful holiday cartoon classic and turns it into something gormless, vulgar and awful. The cartoon used imaginative language and iconic animation to create its magical effect. Howard replaces all of that with gaudy art direction and stupid physical humour. The makeup effects are creepy, not cute; the Whovillians are anonymous drones -- and it doesn't help that they look like half pig/half human lab creations. Jim Carrey, who on paper seems like he would be perfect casting, overplays to the hilt, creating exactly the opposite effect to that inspired by the original droll creation of animator Chuck Jones and actor Boris Karloff. The only positive attribute Carrey could have brought to the film, that rubber face with which he could have created any number of comic moments, is buried underneath heaps of prosthetic makeup.This is a foul, terrible movie, and I can't believe that anyone could possibly like it. How it even rated a 5.6 here at IMDb is beyond me.Grade: F",-1,-1,0,-1,-1,-999,-1
How the Grinch Stole Christmas,"I think that anyone who has even just a shred of common sense would see that making a live action AND feature length version of Dr. Seuss' ""How The Grinch Stole Christmas"" is asking for trouble. To begin with, just look at how this movie looks visually. Now, they could have managed to pull off the visual look - the movie ""The 5000 Fingers Of Dr. T"" managed to have live action Seuss-like visuals that worked. But in THIS movie, it looks horrible. It looks artificial, way overproduced, and to make matters worse the green and pink lighting makes it look even uglier than it was originally.Maybe if they had made this a 100% computer animated movie, they could have pulled off the visual look... but there would still be a bunch of problems, mainly with the script. The Whos, except for Cindy Lou, are a bunch of cold-hearted ugly-looking creeps - you'll actually wish that the Grinch succeed in his plans to ruin their Christmas. The story moves at a snail's pace, due to the writers feeling they had to put in a lot of back story. Further evidence of the writers' desperation is that they take several elements of the 1960s Chuck Jones' version of the tale and replicate them here.Carey tries - he is pretty enthusiastic in his performance - but even he becomes quickly exhausting to witness. But he's not to blame here - blame the director and the writers for shoving him and the rest of the movie down our throats.",-1,1,-1,-1,0,0,-1
Die Hard,"Even if the non-action parts are a tad slow in comparison, that is more than compensated by so many things that makes Die Hard so brilliant.For one thing the action is explosive and consistently exciting, and the cinematography is astounding being very inventive and colourful. John McTiernon(The Hunt for Red October, Last Action Hero) directs briskly and efficiently, and the pacing a vast majority of the time is exhilarating.Then there is a terrific score by Michael Kamen, some intelligent and witty scripting and a plot that doesn't feel forced or convoluted. Not to mention some excellent acting. As good as Bruce Willis is, yes his character is somewhat two-dimensional, but he is also resourceful and world-weary and Willis handles this really well, it is Alan Rickman who steals the acting honours as Hans Gruber. Gruber is cold, calculating, suave and menacing, in my opinion only Rickman could do justice to such a character. Overall, a superb movie, not only the best of the Die Hard franchise but one of the best of the action genre. 10/10 Bethany Cox",1,1,1,1,0,1,1
Die Hard,"Die Hard (1988) *** (out of 4)Enjoyable and tense thriller about a group of terrorists (led by Alan Rickman) who overtake a L.A. skyscraper and the only thing keeping them from getting away with their crime is a New York police officer (Bruce Willis) there on vacation. There's a lot of very good things about this movie but I've always thought that the majority of the credit has to go to star Willis. He might not have been a A-list star at the time this was released but it's easy to see why he became one afterwards. I think what's so great about him and the character he plays is that we can believe he's just your typical guy you'd see walking around on the streets with you. That every-day-man quality that Willis has works so well here because of the odds stacked against his character you can't help but just sit back and enjoy this one person taking out a professional organization. The hilarious one-liners, the smart remarks and the way Willis makes himself know to the terrorists is just classic and we get so many great showdowns that you can't help enjoy all of them. It certainly doesn't hurt that you've got a strong supporting cast with Rickman being a villain you just love to hate. The coldness RIckman brings to the part is the perfect contrast to Willis' cop and it works perfectly. Reginald VelJohnson, William Atherton, Bonnie Bedelia and Paul Gleason also add great support for Willis to play off of. The action scenes are certainly some of the best you're going to see and what holds them together so well is the direction by John McTiernan. He perfectly blends the humor, tension and the action but he also gives the film a wonderful pace that keeps it moving at a fast rate. DIE HARD might be far-fetched in what one man is able to do but this really doesn't take away from any of the fun.",1,1,1,1,1,1,0
Die Hard,"This original action classic has been hugely influential over the years - and it's no surprise, as it's one of the best action thrillers ever made. New meaning is brought to the word ""action"" as here it is exhilarating, furious and nothing less than exciting. The premise is simple: one location, one good guy and twelve bad guys. Cue lots of explosions, fist fights, blood, violence, and plenty of shooting too. The thrills come from the suspense of Willis using his wits as well as his brawn to fight the bad guys and save the hostages.When watching this film what becomes immediately apparent is how fresh it is. This hasn't been filmed with some cheap cameras for a quick buck, it looks professional and couldn't be less polished. The photography is clear and brings out the best of the surroundings, while the music has obviously been carefully chosen to convey the right mood. And, strangely enough for an action film, the acting is actually very good. Unheard of, as remember this was back in the days where Schwarzenegger and Stallone were the top stars of the action genre. Bruce Willis excels as the wisecracking, sardonic cop, and you can't fail to like him. He's consistently witty and provides a powerful presence when needed - it comes as no surprise as he lived off this image for the next six or seven years.The supporting cast aren't half bad, either. The reliable Bonnie Bedelia takes a break from her usual highbrow, ""moral dilemma"", television movie fare as Willis' tough wife, while Reginald Veljohnson is also great as a sympathetic cop - you just want to hug him. But most memorable of all is Alan Rickman for his excellent turn as the cool, calculating terrorist with a carefully-crafted German accent and a fine line in natty suits. Rickman is THE bad guy of modern cinema, watch any subsequent action film with terrorists and you'll see people trying to be him. He's that good. The rest of the cast of terrorists have all been picked for their imposing looks, and they're not bad either. Keep your eyes peeled for fearsome Bond baddie Robert Davi in a minor role as an FBI man.As well as the tense running around in corridors and stand-offs between Willis and the various creeps, this film really delivers in the action stakes. The guys here really do look like they are trying their hardest to kill each other, and we get people flying down stairs, getting chains wrapped around their necks, getting shot all over the place. Every kill that Willis makes is original and exciting. There are also plenty of ace stunts, like when Willis jumps off an exploding roof with only a fire hose tied around his waist. The gore level is high, graphic in fact, with people being shot apart wherever you look, and it's definitely a film for all cinema fans to enjoy. Consistently entertaining and strong enough to withstand repeated viewings, this is the first and final word on the ""one guy versus lots of bad guys"" sub-genre of the action flick.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1
Die Hard,"The world has a new hero. John McClane (Bruce Willis) is a NYPD officer who's come to LA to reconcile with his wife Holly (Bonnie Bedelia). They're at her employer's Christmas party when the building is taken over by German terrorist Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman).John McClane isn't your regular 80s muscle bound superhuman hero. He's the everyman. He bleeds. He suffers. He wisecracks. He can talk in full sentences. He uses his brain as much as his muscles. He's just in the wrong place at the wrong time.The action is big and grandiose. It takes the adage that bigger is better to its limits. Unlike Schwarzenegger and Stallone, the action seems bigger and crazier. Explosions roll off the backs of those muscle heads, but John McClane really suffers. That's the trick.",1,1,1,0,0,1,1
Die Hard,"I first saw Die Hard in the late 1980's and have owned it on various formats down the years and will watch it now and again. One of the main reasons I enjoy it so is because of the iconic place it holds within the action genre. At the time it came out we were mostly served up pumped-up action heroes who happily take on entire armies and win in battles that are mostly a simple matter of good versus evil, where good is US and evil is them (whoever them happened to be at that time). Die Hard manages to be more than that by starting out with a ""normal"" guy as our hero. Now I won't pretend that McClane is not an action hero who does extraordinary things but he seems accessible. I particularly like the fact that his first reaction is to run, to call for help form others and that he only faces the terrorists when he has to, rather than going all Rambo on us.If this approach provides a grounding, the concept also brings the action into a slightly more real environment. The action is more or less confined to the tower and the bad guys limited rather than being a constantly flowing army of stuntmen. Director McTiernan uses the location really well, injecting tension and a sense of claustrophobia that works really well. The action is enjoyable and offers a lesson that modern CGI-heavy action movies can learn from  if you rely totally on technology then you'll date quickly, if you make the effects serve the action and narrative then you'll be standing for years. As a result the action in Die Hard feels no less slick or exciting for being almost twenty years old.Although this is the most important part of the film to get right, I always appreciated the clever subtexts in the narrative. Filmed in the 1980's, the film is a clever attack on yuppie values in contrast with the blue-collar ""man's man"" type. In this way the narrative can be viewed as those seeking more and more wealth getting in the way of those who just want to be with their families. The most obvious attack on the business culture is the aligning of the terrorists and the corporation. Hans and Takagi share taste in suits, education, knowledge and even share the same opening lines (""ladies & gentlemen""); it is not a stretch to see the film suggesting that Takagi may have also shared some of Hans' ruthlessness in his rise to the top. This is also evident from the very start  John does not lose his wife to Hans, he has already lost her to the corporation as she drops his name and had moved away. Indeed such is the films paralleling of these two threats to McClane, that he only rescues Holly from Hans by getting the watch off her wrist  the watch that was specifically mentioned at the start of the film as a gift from the company.Ellis sees the connection being made even more obvious as he himself suggests little difference between himself and Hans, apart from the gun and fountain pen aspect. Of course with both businessmen being connected to the terrorists in this way, they must also share their fate, and do. Although it has lumbered the film series with a rather poor catchphrase, the discussion of westerns again confirms the contrast between ""man's man"" and ""new man""  a connection further made by having McClane in his vest, an outfit more befitting a blue collar worker who has his values in the USA frontier rather than the cut-throat world of foreign business. This distain for bureaucracy is also seen in the redemption of Al. Stuck outside the action in the building (handicapped by incompetence) but also desk-bound due to shooting a kid. At the end of the movie he is redeemed by killing Karl in a ""quick-draw"" style shoot out, freeing him from his desk and restoring his manhood. Again the split between bureaucracy and real workers and again the use of wild-west symbolism.The cast respond to the strong script and direction by turning in roundly good performances. Willis has not really been better (even in the same character) and his action twist on his Moonlighting character was the making of him. It is Rickman that dominates the film though; like in Robin Hood, he is a delightful sneering bad guy who has great lines and great presence. The support cast is good below them with Bedelia avoiding being just a damsel in distress; VelJohnson a solid ""buddy""; Godunov is a real physical threat  even if a few of the other terrorists barely make an impression on the memory. Gleason, Atherton, White and Davi all give a good show as well.Rightly an iconic action movie then. The action has stood up really well and is delivered within a story that is tense and well paced. The performances suit the material and, if you want it, there is a clever and engaging subtext running across the whole film. I find it hard to fault and you can see why it has had the influence it has had on the action genre over the last twenty years.",1,1,1,1,0,1,0
Die Hard,"When it comes to action-adventure films of the 1980s. You have Raiders of the Lost Ark standing as a colossus. The ultimate homage to the 1930 'B' serials.

He was not someone with bulging muscles like Sylvester Stallone or a former martial arts star or bodybuilder.John McClane the every-man who happens to be a New York cop visiting his estranged wife at her firm's Christmas party, rather partial to Roy Rogers ends up being in the wrong place at the wrong time.Just as the party gets into full swing a bunch of European terrorists take over the office tower block to rob some financial bonds, led by the magnetic and then unknown Alan Rickman (who in those pre Google days, some critics mistook to be some undiscovered German actor readymade to be a Bond villain!)However as the villains hold the rest of the group hostage waiting for their plan to unfurl including getting an assist from the FBI, there is a fly on the ointment. McClane is on the loose and picking off the bad guys one by one.You have a beat cop in contact with McClane, some inept cops, even more inept and gung ho FBI agents, a slimy journalist and a film director on top form giving you one of the best action films of all time.A mixture of thrills, action and humour. Just look at scene when Uli (the oriental bad guy) glances at the chocolate bar during a tense moment and steals it, or Rickman naming some freedom fighter groups which seem to be made up and he states to his fellow henchman that he read about them in Time Magazine.Ultimately Willis pitches his character just right. Here is an actor hungry for that breakout role and he sure hit bulls-eye here even though some of his subsequent actions films have been disappointing.At the other end is Rickman playing the suave, sophisticated and ruthless villain. He brings charisma by the truck load and this was also his launchpad to stardom.",1,1,1,1,0,1,1
Die Hard,"John McClane (Bruce Willis), officer of the NYPD, tries to save wife Holly Gennaro and several others, taken hostage by German terrorist Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) during a Christmas party at the Nakatomi Plaza in Los Angeles.This was the debut of Alan Rickman, the film that cemented Bruce Willis' career as an action star, and possibly the greatest action of film of all time (or at the very least, the 1980s). While it could have become dated, it has not -- not in the slightest.As I write this (December 2013), there is a new ""Red Dawn"" where the Soviets were replaced with North Koreans. The original is now a time capsule. ""Die Hard"" remains timeless because the terrorists were ""European"" and not tied to any particular ideology or movement. This was a wise decision.",1,1,1,1,0,1,0
Die Hard,"This remains one of the modern-day ""classic"" movies that was so popular that is spun several sequels. It was just great entertainment value.The story was ludicrous: one man beating a group of terrorists with outrageous, almost-impossible feats - another ""Rambo"" mentality flick - but it worked. The action scenes are memorable; Bruce Willis is good as the macho hero and David Warner is excellent as the villain.Otherwise, the film is way too profane and too biased, as usual, against law enforcement showing the acting police chief and FBI agents to be arrogant, stupid and crude....just what Liberal Hollywood always does to anyone in authority. But John McTiernan gets away with his profanity-laden bias by directing a film that grabs you early on and never lets you go.....very involving.",1,1,1,1,0,1,0
Die Hard,"About twenty-five years ago it came to light that Elmyr de Hory had been painting fake Rembrandts and Matisses and Monets and whatnot. The fakes were bought by expert collectors and some of them hung in famous galleries. The fakes were so good that they became works of art in themselves, glowing with a technical mastery of the medium, lacking only originality.That's kind of what this movie is like. I don't believe there's an original thought in the whole hour and a half of it, but what is shown on screen is beautifully executed -- direction, script, performances, photography, production design.Everything's derivative. Nothing will surprise you. Even the score is completely ripped off. I mean in its entirety -- Beethoven's Choral Symphony. Nothing could be more obscene than seeing the faces of the murdering thieves light up as the vault door swings open to reveal millions of dollars, while Schiller's Ode to Joy swells up on the score.The whole thing is as shiny and sterile as Nakatomi Plaza, and man that is one repugnant space. Towering blocks of geometrically perfect steel and glass, with three probably real trees in the drivearound, although they would have fit the general tone of the movie if they'd been plastic. The human scale is totally lost. Imagine a supersized Leggo community. Imagine the ants who crawl into those monstrous edifice wrecks every morning, pausing before the entrance, staring up at the steel column disappearing into the clouds, and moaning aloud, ""Oh, my God, not another day of THIS."" Bruce Willis is very good as the New York cop who is the fly in gangleader Alan Rickman's ointment. This is a typical action hero role but Willis brings a comic element to it that, say, Schwarzenegger, Stallone, or Eastwood simply could not. Oh, the others could make wisecracks under stress just as well as Willis, but they couldn't do his hysterically shocked and frightened face when some contretemps comes his way. He looks really scared, his eyeballs practically popping out. Have you ever seen Stallone look scared? No, you haven't. Don't try to kid the kid. Here's how you can tell the difference between the three main heroes of the 1980s action movies. Bruce Willis gets bloody and out of breath. Stallone gets bloody but is never out of breath. Schwarzenegger is never either bloody or breathless. That'll be ten cents.I didn't care too much for Rickman's villain. With that aquiline nose and that mouth full of big white choppers he seemed altogether too slimy. When I first saw this movie, I thought this was the extent of his range. But I was wrong. I've since seen him in half a dozen other varied roles and he has a lot of talent.It's curious to see Hollywood movies flailing about in search of an agreed-upon villain since the collapse of the USSR. I keep wondering whom they'll turn up next. The stock heavies have been Germans (WWII) and Russians (the Cold War). Lately, of course, they've been ""camel jockeys"", to use the current pejorative. ""Die Hard"" opts for the tried and true -- Germans, one of whom has a Russian accent. (Alexander Gudonov, a failed defected ballet dancer, neat guy, who died of drink at an early age.) The action is very well choreographed. Outstanding is the scene in which the roof explodes just as Willis jumps out of a window with a fire hose tied around his waist. He jerks to a stop when the fire hose runs out, smashes through an office window, and the metal roll that contained the hose falls past the broken window and -- well, and so on.There's action, comedy, romance, and all the rest, done to a turn. If you want to be entertained undemandingly for a while, this should do the job.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Die Hard,"One of the original action flicks from the '80s, John McTiernan's ""Die Hard"" makes no pretense about being a kick-ass movie. Bruce Willis plays a New York cop John McClane, coming to LA to meet his estranged wife (Bonnie Bedelia). Sure enough, the building in which she works get hijacked by a group of German terrorists. Terrorist leader Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman in his debut), while totally evil, is also quite cultured. Even though the cards look stacked against John McClane, he's ready to take on every one of these terrorists.Twenty years after its release, this movie will probably only appeal to Willis's fans. While mostly a litany of machismo, there are some cringe-inducing scenes (namely when John has to walk across glass). But the movie's main focus is to show Bruce Willis being a tough guy. They do everything possible to make him a superhuman individual to whom we can still relate.All in all, this is a flick that you'll want to avoid if you're into intellectualism. But you'll love it if you're a testosterone-driven dude. I think that I'm content having seen it only once.

Die Hard,"From director John McTiernan (Predator) comes the first of the highly popular action thriller films with the star of Moonlighting (in his third film, after two failures). It is Christmas Eve, and John McClane (Bruce Willis) has arrived in Los Angeles to see his wife Holly Gennaro McClane (Bonnie Bedelia) who along with his kids he has not seen for six months. Her promotion is what brought her from New York to LA, and she had to move to work in the Nakatomi Plaza, a 40 story building. She has to do a speech at the party going on, and she leaves the room saying she'll be back, and a few minutes later, a group of German terrorists led by mastermind Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) and his right-hand man Karl (Alexander Godunov) enter the building and take everyone on the 30th floor hostage. John manages to get away and hide in the upper building, still under construction, and the terrorists have no idea he is there. Hans takes Holly's boss Joseph Yashinobo Takagi (James Shigeta) and demands he give him the computer code to open the building's safe to steal $640,000,000 in bearer bonds, and Takagi is killed when he refuses, which John witnesses. Technology expert Theo (Clarence Gilyard Jr.) is told to start working on getting the safe opened, which he thinks will take a couple of hours, John meanwhile is trying to alert the LAPD, because the phone lines have been cut. Once the police are there, they prove incompetent under the command of arrogant deputy chief Dwayne T. Robinson (The Breakfast Club's Paul Gleason), and only Sergeant Al Powell (Reginald VelJohnson) on the walkie talkie supports him, so John has to save the hostages alone. There is one part where John meets Hans face to face, but he believes for a tiny while he is a hostage, because he puts on an American accent. Eventually, John manages to help the hostages, stop the robbery, and confront Hans who is holding his wife#s bracelet, but he does fall to his death eventually. Also starring De'Voreaux White as Argyle, William Atherton as Richard Thornburg, Hart Bochner as Harry Ellis, The Living Daylights' Andreas Wisniewski as Tony, Licence to Kill's Robert Davi as Agent Johnson and Grand L. Bush as Agent Johnson. Filled with fantastic action and stunts (some done by Willis himself), great acting, a humorous, wise cracking and admirable hero in the wrong place at the wrong time, a cunning villain, and the great catchphrase, ""Yippee-ki-yay, mother f***er"", this is an essential action thriller. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Sound Effects Editing, Best Visual Effects, Best Film Editing and Best Sound. Bruce Willis was number 35 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Hans Gruber was number 46 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes & Villains, and the film was number 39 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills. Outstanding!",1,1,1,1,1,1,1
Die Hard,"Totally outrageous, totally unbelievable and totally over the top - and as Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) would say - 'But who cares'? It's Bruce Willis in a version of saving humanity along the lines of John Wayne, Rambo and Marshal Dillon. Personally, John McClane had me when he said he was partial to Roy Rogers because that's who my favorite TV and movie cowboy was as a kid growing up. I'd bet that someone might say that of Willis some day.In his own way, John McClane must have had some sort of mystical power because up until the point he started crawling through the transom feeling like a TV dinner, his wife-beater t-shirt was white with some blood spatter. But when he hit the floor again to do battle with the bad guys it suddenly turned brown. So mesmerized was I by this turn of events that I never even noticed when the shirt turned a neat dark forest green later in the picture. I wonder how stuff like that gets by the director? Say, and how about the FBI sending in a double Johnson to take over the attack at Nakatomi Plaza? I'm sure there's a pretty good punch line in there somewhere but I think I'll just let it go for now.It's been stated, and rightly so I think, that this film set a new standard for action/adventure flicks with Bruce Willis portraying a new kind of hero. He's smart, thinks on his feet, takes what help he can get, and engages in wise-ass banter to keep the audience fully engaged. All the noise, explosions and crashing glass is merely window dressing to keep the story moving as our hero saves the day. What more can you ask for in a two hour action flick? You know, if this was a Roy Rogers Western it would probably have a title like ""Under California Stars"". If I had to guess, I'd say Bruce Willis saw that one when he was a kid.",1,1,1,1,1,1,0
Die Hard,"When New York detective John McClane goes to Los Angeles to visit his wife who works for a large Japanese company he is expecting a fairly quiet time he certainly doesn't expect the party celebrating the opening of the company's brand new skyscraper to be gate-crashed by a dozen or more heavily armed terrorists lead by a German called Hans Gruber! Luckily when they strike he is away from the party in his wife's office so he is able to lead a one man fight back. Once he has managed to kill one of the terrorists he can use his radio to try to contact the local police although they don't seem to believe him until a body comes crashing through the windscreen of Sgt. Al Powell's squad car! He becomes McClane's contact as the situation intensifies as first the LAPD then the FBI attempt to deal with Hans and his gang. It is soon clear that Hans has anticipated the responses of everybody except McClane so it is up to him to thwart their plans.The eighties were a decade packed with great action movies; a decade where action meant fights, bullets and plenty of explosions all accompanied by a few witty one-liners rather than excessive CGI and this is one of the best examples of an '80s action film. Bruce Willis was on top form as John McClane and Alan Rickman was delightfully over the top as Hans Gruber, Reginald VelJohnson also does a decent job as Sgt. Powell. As well as the almost non-stop action there some laughs to be had although they never feel forced. If you like '80s action films then you really need to watch this and if you've seen it already; watch it again!",1,1,1,1,0,1,1
Die Hard,"The first time I ever saw Die Hard it was at the Film On The Square screening, part of the London Film Festival in Leicester Square, November 1988; I spent the following weeks—up until the film's official UK release date on February 3rd—trying to convince people that Bruce Willis would be the next big Hollywood action star and that Die Hard would change the face of the action genre forever. 'Bruce Willis from Moonlighting?' they would say, 'I don't think so.' 'Just wait and see', I would reply...A quarter of a century later and Bruce is still proving me right (the fifth Die Hard movie came out earlier this year and Red 2 is on general release as I type); but no matter how long the guy keeps on blowing stuff up and shooting bad guys on screen, I doubt he will ever match the brilliance of Die Hard, which remains the pinnacle of action cinema as far as I am concerned, a film where everything came together to create pure cinematic gold.Director John McTiernan at the top of his game, fresh from the success of Schwarzenegger vehicle Predator; perfect casting throughout, from Alan Rickman's loathsome lead villain Hans Gruber and Bonnie Bedelia's plucky Holly McClean, right down to Al Leong as mustachioed henchman Uli and Playboy Playmate Terri Lynn Doss as the blonde hottie at the airport; a great soundtrack that combines hip-hop and classical music with a seasonal flavour; visual effects from Richard Edlund that still hold up well against any of today's CGI; superb cinematography courtesy of Jan De Bont; a brilliant script with cracking dialogue and a wry sense of humour (that scene with the SWAT member catching himself on a rose bush still cracks me up!): Die Hard is virtually flawless in every department.Unless you've been in a coma or living in a cave for the past two and a half decades, you'll no doubt be familiar with the plot, so I won't waste any time summarising what happens, suffice to say that the set-up is lean, mean and full of explosive, edge-of-the-seat action, and is still influencing action film-makers today, recent examples being comic-book sci-fi flick Dredd and martial arts actioner The Raid. But no matter how many derivatives (or sequels) it spawns, the original will always be the best—a white knuckle ride of a movie with the power to thrill your socks off even after all of these years (so watch out for broken glass!).",1,1,1,1,0,1,1
Die Hard,"I finally got around to seeing Bruce Willis' ""Die Hard"", and for sure it is not a very good movie. Sure, it has lots of shoot-em-up action, but a very thin thread of a story about foreign thugs holding captive a big business celebration party at the top of a high-rise in L.A. to try and steal the $450 million of certificates in the safe. It is predominantly Willis as the N.Y. cop, coming to visit his L.A. businesswoman wife, and his outsmarting the bad guys. It even ends in a neat little package with him and his wife (Bonnie Bedelia) walking out arm-in-arm. It's high rating on the Imdb, currently #129, is disrespectful to all those fine movies rated below it. The best I could rate ""Die Hard"" is 5 or 6 on the 10-point scale.",0,1,0,0,0,1,1

Die Hard,"Action packed is to put it mildly. A very engrossing film with Bruce Willis starring as a N.Y.C. police officer who goes to Los Angeles to see a retired comrade and his estranged wife, Bonnie Bedelia and their two children.Go know that he would get caught up in quite a thriller, where supposed terrorists take over the building during his visit. McClain curses, smokes but is able to thwart the attempts by these terrorists, who as the film progresses, are shown to be nothing more than robbers.Willis is evenly matched by Alan Rickman, the mastermind of the gang, With his sinister looks, Rickman is the embodiment of evil. That speaking voice of his goes a long way to create such a character.The destruction to that building is phenomenal. The picture also shows you the reluctance of the LAPD to react at first to such a situation and the bond that Willis forms with an LA officer, hesitant in using his gun because he killed a 13 year old with it some time before.A wonderful film.",1,1,1,0,0,1,1
Die Hard,"The 1988 was the movie that definitely put Bruce Willis on the radar for me, as this movie turned out to be such a blast of an action movie back in 1988. In fact, it is a movie that still holds up in 2020; where I just revisited it yet again.""Die Hard"" is very much a late 1980s action movie with everything that term carries. And ""Die Hard"" placed Bruce Willis right up there alongside the likes of Stallone, Schwarzenegger, Seagal and Van Damme back in the late 1980s.The storyline told in ""Die Hard"" is an enjoyable and entertaining storyline, one that actually has enough contents and material to it to support several viewings over the years. And while one does know the story after having seen the movie, there is just something solid about it to make it possible to watch it again and again.Now, they cast some nice performers for ""Die Hard"". Needless to mention Bruce Willis in this movie, but Alan Rickman in the role of Hans Gruber was just so well-cast because he performed so well and that role was just tailored for him and his charismatic presence. I remember being rather impressed with seeing Reginald VelJohnson (playing Al Powell) in this movie back in 1988, as I had only seen him on that TV series ""Family Matters"".Some people claim that ""Die Hard"" is a Christmas movie. I beg to differ. Just because the story was set to take place during the Christmas holidays doesn't make it a Christmas movie, nor does ""Die Hard"" have the contents to be a Christmas movie in any way. So nay, I am not one of those claiming that ""Die Hard"" is a Christmas classic.If you haven't already seen ""Die Hard"", then there is something wrong, because this is one of the defining action movies of the late 1980s. So if you haven't already seen this classic action movie, then you should most definitely take the time to do so.My rating of ""Die Hard"" settles on a well-deserved 8 out of 10 stars.",1,1,1,1,0,1,1
Die Hard,"Die Hard is an action film directed by John McTiernan and written by Steve de Souza and Jeb Stuart based on the 1979 novel Nothing Lasts Forever by Roderick Thorp.The film follows NYPD officer John McClane,played by Bruce Willis, as he takes on a group of highly organized criminals led by Hans Gruber performing a heist under the guise of a terrorist attack, using hostages including McClane's wife Holly to keep the police at bay.It's Christmas time in L.A., and there's an employee party in progress on the 30th floor of the Nakatomi Corporation building. The revelry comes to a violent end when the party goers are taken hostage by a group of terrorists headed by Hans Gruber, who plan to steal the 600 million dollars locked in Nakatomi's high-tech safe. In truth, Gruber and his henchmen are only pretending to be politically motivated to throw the authorities off track; also in truth, Gruber has no intention of allowing anyone to get out of the building alive. Meanwhile, New York cop John McClane has come to L.A. to visit his estranged wife, Holly, who happens to be one of the hostages. Disregarding the orders of the authorities surrounding the building, McClane, who fears nothing (except heights), takes on the villains, armed with one handgun and plenty of chutzpah. The scenes move with such relentless energy and smashing special-effects extravagance that Die Hard turns out to be everything action-genre fans, and Bruce Willis's relieved investors, might have hoped for.Apart from that,it is characterized as great pace, great gun battles, great fun.For this reason alone,Die Hard delivers.",1,1,1,1,0,1,1
Die Hard,"Spoilers herein.Here's a conundrum: the vacation action thrillers that star unkillable heros themselves die a quick death. Even a short time later they are limp. Seen ""Speed"" lately? Each is a matter of repetition with the heat turned up a very little, so the next guy always makes it obsolete.But not this one. I've stopped by every few years, and it never seems dated. (Well, maybe the pseudo-terrorist plot.) But its just in a whole different category than any Arnie movie. They fade fast. I think it is a matter of originality, pacing and the stance that Willis invented. The pacing really is a black art, and to judge from McTeirnan's subsequent missteps, was an accident. But I have to give Bruce Willis a lot of credit. We live in an era when we expect nothing to be done straight. Some ironic coloring is expected, some compact between the film and the audience that gives us traction on which to build fun. Sly, Arnie, Chuck and those others take it all so seriously. Bruce, and later Mel (with less intelligence) would first establish their character with the audience as their man, their representative in the action.Then, once in a while, he'd all but look at the camera and say ""ain't this a gas, watch this!""I don't pretend that Bruce is a fine actor, but he certainly reinvented film. And in his own way as much as Brando. This is his ""streetcar.""It is important in the history of film, and in how we as a society deal with abstraction. And it is still fun, with the ""cancel Christmas"" guy.Ted's evaluation: 3 of 4 -- worth watching",1,1,1,0,0,1,1
Die Hard,"Based on ex cop Roderick Thorpe's 1979 novel Nothing Lasts Forever, Die Hard, directed by John McTiernan, changed the face of the action movie. Starring Bruce Willis, Alan Rickman, Bonnie Bedelia, Reginald Veljohnson, Alexander Godunov, William Atherton & Paul Gleason, McTiernan's movie went on to make over $100 million in profit at the box office alone. Spawning three equally successful sequels (at the time of writing), it began a franchise that showed that if done well, the action movie could be a dominant force in the world of cinema. The set up is relatively simple, Willis plays New York cop John McLane who during the Christmas holidays is in L.A. to visit his estranged wife Holly (Bedelia). She works for the Japanese Corporation of Nakatomi, and currently she's attending the company Christmas party up on the 30th floor of the humongous Nakatomi Plaza tower block. Bad day at the office because a group of apparent German terrorists, led by the charismatic Hans Gruber (Rickman), take the whole building hostage: with one exception; McLane, who evades capture and launches a one man war against the terrorists. What follows is just over two hours of high octane action, smart dialogue and technical smarts. McTiernan had already endeared himself to the action movie fan with the ball busting beef stew that was Predator in 87, a fact not lost on Die Hard's co producer Joel Silver, who clearly knew that McTiernan could smoothly shift the action from the Val Verde jungle to the urban jungle of L.A. And he did. Next was to get the right man for McLane. Richard Gere was first choice but passed, so the makers took a gamble on Willis, whose career was at a standstill after his leap from TV show Moonlighting on to the big screen with the likes of Blind Date & Sunset barely making a ripple in Hollywood. The rest for Willis, as they say, is history. McLane is an everyman hero, streetwise, even slobbish, but identifiable to many with his work ethics, desperate heroics and emotional vulnerability. Willis attacks the role with a hunger rarely seen from the big male earners in filmdom. During the two hours and ten minute running time of Die Hard, Willis as McLane changed the face of the action hero for ever; even making a dirty white vest iconic in the process; the latter of which couples nicely with the hero being bare footed throughout for a nifty bit of writing. Across the board the casting is flawless, Bedelia is spunky and driven, a woman worth fighting for. Veljohnson as beat copper Al Powell-McLane's walkie-talkie buddy and only link to the outside world-is memorable because it feels real, he has his own issue gnawing away at him, but his exchanges with Willis keeps the humanity grounded as the carnage unfolds. Gleason & Atherton are wonderfully anal as Deputy Police Chief and TV Reporter respectively, while Hart Bochner as Ellis dishes out one of the best weasel turns to have ever graced a movie featuring corporate suit types. But as Die Hard resembles the great Westerns of yesteryear, much like the great Oaters, Die Hard could only be as good as its chief villain. As Willis' McLane ushered in a new action hero to copy, Rickman's uber intelligent villain set a new benchmark. Snappily dressed, well versed and as charming as they come, Gruber in Rickman's hands is a villain you could quite easily root for! That's further testament to Willis' turn that Rickman doesn't walk away with the movie, both men are from different sides of the fence, good and evil, yet both are characters you can hang your hat on. Quite a trick from McTiernan that. Rickman is ably supported by the scary Godunov as right hand man Karl and Clarence Gilyard Jr. as the cold hearted Theo. Elsewhere the impact of Robert Davi & Grand L. Bush as the two cocksure FBI agents Johnson & Johnson (no relation) should not be underestimated. All the actors, of course, are indebted to the sizzling script by Steven E. de Souza & Jeb Stuart. So to is praise due to photographer Jan de Bont, who in collaboration with McTiernan, produces a camera work lesson for action movies, as the camera swoops in and around the tower, down elevator shafts and up tilt to roofs; with the fight scenes afforded a spatial sheen not expected in the confines of a tower block setting (the film was actually shot at 20th Century Fox's own 2121 Fox Plaza). Even the scoring from Michael Kamen and the sound tracking are of a high standard; check out the various ""mood"" uses of Beethoven's Ode to Joy from Symphony No.9 and Bach's Brandenburg Concerto No. 3 In G Major: Brilliant. The 80s was well served by action movies with the likes of Lethal Weapon and Beverly Hills Cop proving massively popular. But just as Raiders Of The Lost Ark changed the game for action/adventure, so too did Die Hard. It's now the benchmark movie for action, a film that unlike Hills Cop & Lethal Weapon remarkably shows no signs of ageing either. It's no monkey in the wrench or a fly in the ointment, it's the daddy, and the one that all other action movies have to answer to. 10/10",1,1,1,1,1,1,1
Die Hard,"1988 and the undisputed number one action star was that Austrian body builder with the funny name with that monosylabic guy from ROCKY in second place . The thing I hated about Arnie and Sly is that their action movies were uninvolving with over blown battle scenes where the good guys never seemed to be in danger of dying . I was also going to bring the James Bond franchise into the conversation but the series became a parody when Bond stopped speaking with a Scottish accent sometime in the early 70s
DIE HARD is different to the other 80s action fests with John McLane being a fairly believable genre character . Okay he`s two dimensional but that`s got to be one dimension more than John Rambo who only exists to kill a lot of nasty commies so Americans can flock to the cinema . It`s also interesting to note that McLane`s wife is used in the plot which is slightly different from how most action films work out where the hero is normally single , but that`s probably because DIE HARD as more depth to it than many contemparies. Perhaps the biggest difference is that McLane is slightly flawed as we`re shown one scene where the hero gives the bad guys something they want , not something you`d see in a Arnie or Sly movie . I won`t mention the stunts or the tightly written set pieces or how compelling they are because everyone else has beat me to it , except to say that big explosions and gun fights often overwhelm an action movie ( Bond movies are a good example ) but here they occur from the narrative instead of someone cramming them into the script in a vain attempt to thrill the audience . Normally I`d have a fit that an action blockbuster is well inside the IMDB top 250 but DIE HARD does deserve to be there since it`s the best movie of its type of its era .",1,1,1,1,0,1,1
Die Hard,"Die Hard is what it is: terrorists looking to secure $400 million, hidden in a vault in various ways (stocks, treasures from empires, paintings, etc), hold a partying white collar group of a corporation, celebrating in a long, tall, posh, under-construction, swank high rise in Los Angeles, hostage (including the wife of the heroic cop, John McClaine, from New York City) while a visiting cop, hidden in a bathroom (with no socks/shoes), escapes, becoming a real thorn up their ass, taking them out one by one as their leader (played by the coolly confident, reserved Alan Rickman, who never rattles even as it appears he's in deep trouble when law enforcement (including the FBI) surround the building). That's it. The plot is just enough to allow Bruce Willis to shoot a bunch of people while stacking the odds considerably against him.You get explosions gutting the high rise, windows shattering into debris from gunfire, legs and bodies torn apart by bullets, and machine guns causing plenty of casualties and damage to walls. Willis makes nifty use of C-4 and uses the strap of a machine gun and a fire hose to get out of sticky situations. There's even a brutal scene as a worried Willis pulls glass from the bottom of his feet while telling police officer Al (played by Reginald VelJohnson of Family Matters fame) a message to give to his wife just in case he doesn't make it. This movie has the clichés, including the ridiculous return of a heavy who miraculously recovers from being lynched by heavy chained coiled three times around his throat only to be taken down by a cop who says he will never draw his gun from his holster after an unfortunate shooting of a thirteen year old hood. If you enjoy movies where a heroic cop constantly evades certain death by eluding his adversaries through cunning and brilliant canny to think on his feet (although even he can be somewhat fooled as Rickman is able, for a moment, to trick Willis into thinking he's a hostage; not to mention, he walks into a gun pointing at his face (it's to Willis good fortune that he has made the thug so mad he wants to fight with fists instead of popping a couple rounds in his face), then Die Hard is the gold standard of such movies.Sure, the movie's implausibilities are many, but I embrace these things in an action movie from the 80shell, it is to be expected. A good villain helps and this one's (Rickman) is a doozy. Willis has some great quips and one-liners, putting him in great company along with Arnold and Sly because he able to slide comfortably into such a tough-guy archetype seemingly easily—I found him wholly convincing and exciting to watch. Bonnie Bedelia is expertly cast as an equally tough wife who has become so disenchanted with her husband that she has taken her maiden name back (I got a kick out of Willis' annoyance as he notices her maiden name throughout the building) because Willis wasn't so keen on moving away from The Big Apple to The City of Angels. She, like Willis, is able to buy herself some time, keep her calm when trouble looms, and faces danger without breaking a sweat. Some fun casting for actions fans includes Paul Gleason as a surly asshole (what else but this time of character should one expect from Gleason, he's so reliable as someone who gets under your skin with his attitude) Chief of Police, Hart Bochner as a coke-snorting creep business salesman, and William Atherton as (what else?) a troublesome, success-seeking, self-absorbed news reporter who goes out of his way to get information on Willis, placing him and Bedelia in danger of being discovered. Even though they don't meet until the end, the film hinges on the great chemistry between Willis and VelJohnson who communicate back and forth via walkie talkies during the whole movie. What is rather fascinating about this is the fact that Rickman can listen to their every word. How McClain gets Al's attention with the use of a terrorist's body is a cool action scene fans like me eat up with great joy.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1

McClane escapes but what can he do alone against a large group of terrorists?Full of action, excitement, incredible stunts and tons of gunfights and fistfights. When you think about it the plot it's highly improbable but once the action kicks in you won't care. I saw this opening weekend when it came out in 1988. In first run theatres the Dolby stereo was turned up as loud as it could go. There were LOTS of gunfights and explosions in deafening stereo sound. It was GREAT! There's also great acting by Willis, Bedelia and Rickman. TONS of swearing too. A GREAT action flick. Highly recommended :)",1,1,1,0,0,1,1
White Christmas,"""White Christmas"" is a pleasant but quite formulaic musical--a decent time-passer but not a lot more. However, rather inexplicably, the film turned out to be the #1 box office champ of the year--something I just don't understand when I see it today.The film begins during WWII. Bing Crosby and Danny Kaye play soldiers who are entertaining the troops during Christmas. Soon, the war is over and the two go on to Broadway and become a huge musical team--absolutely huge. The problem is that Kaye is dissatisfied, as they are always working---and his partner is always thinking of business. So, he comes up with a plan--get Bing married and then they'll have to take it easier! And, when the duo meet two musical sisters (Vera-Ellen and Rosemary Clooney), Danny and Vera just decide that Bing MUST marry Rosemary---just like that! Not surprisingly, there are MANY bumps and misunderstandings along the way--as, after all, it IS a very formulaic relationship. What is not exactly formula, however, is the parallel plot involving Danny and Bing's old commander--the General. The General is running a hotel in Vermont--but it's failing due to unusually hot weather. So, the four decide to get together and perform a show--just the sort of thing Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland would have done a decade and a half earlier.The film has a lot of pluses and minuses. As I mentioned above, the film is easy to predict due to its strong use of traditional film formulas. However, the actors did a nice job with what they had. My biggest complaint about the film were all the song and dance numbers. There were just too many and many were quite forgettable. Several could have been cut and more emphasis should have been on plot--but, considering how successful the film was, what do I know? I just know that today the film is a bit sluggish because of this. You cannot trim the title song, but a bit of trimming would have tightened up the film and kept a better pace. Overall, it's uneven but enjoyable.",1,1,1,0,1,1,1
White Christmas,"I can not believe that I did not see this movie before now. Maybe when I was 8, when White Christmas was on every year, I wasn't as into musicals as I am now, save movies like Annie, Wizard of Oz and Oliver! I am truly sorry, for this was an excellent film, that is perfect for the Christmas holiday season. White Christmas looks lovely, shot in beautiful Vista Vision with nice cinematography and wonderful costumes. The red dresses in the reprise of White Christmas especially were to die for. The songs and score by Irving Berlin is outstanding; the title song White Christmas is not only one of my all time favourite Christmas songs but also one of my favourite songs ever in a musical. But the other songs go without fault too, particularly The Best Things Happen When You're Dancing and Sisters.The script and story, serving as a partial remake of Holiday Inn, are top notch, if a little fluffy and implausible in places. Even better were the performances, with Bing Crosby his usual charming self as Bob, and while weak at the start Danny Kaye is superb as Phil. His dance routine with Vera Ellen, who looked gorgeous here and sang and danced a dream, was a knockout. Rosemary Clooney is positively riveting as Betty as well, in a suitably calm and subdued performance. I have to say I loved the choreography, it was clever, fast-paced and energetic. Overall, it may be fluff and a tad schmaltzy, but it is an excellent and timeless holiday movie. 10/10 Bethany Cox",1,1,1,1,1,1,1
White Christmas,"By 1954 the song White Christmas had become such a timeless classic that it was inevitable that a film would be made around it. And of course the star would be none other than Bing Crosby. But who to star with him.Originally this was to be the third Irving Berlin outing for Bing and Fred Astaire. Then Donald O'Connor was to co-star, but finally Danny Kaye teamed with Der Bingle. Proved to be a felicitous combination.By then Rosemary Clooney had worked in a few films well and more importantly, she had clicked with Crosby on the radio. Bing had teamed with several girl singers over the years, like Connee Boswell, Frances Langford, Mary Martin, Trudy Erwin, Carole Richards, Peggy Lee and a trio of sisters named Andrews. But he always said Rosemary Clooney was it for him and besides Mary Martin, the only other one who did became a leading lady for him.It's not remembered because of the success of her solo career, but Rosemary Clooney started as a duo with her sister Betty who retired early to raise a family. So with Vera-Ellen as her sister in the movie, that was an aspect of the plot Rosemary could handle with ease.The plot such as it is involves Bing and Danny as a song and dance duo who've expanded into the production end of show business. Through a little bit of a con game worked by Vera Ellen, the two meet a singing sister act like the Clooney sisters were. The sisters turn out to be headed to Vermont to work at a resort and the smitten guys go along with them.Problem is there ain't any snow there. It's an unheard of 68 degrees Fahrenheit in early December. And the place is owned by Crosby and Kaye's former commander from World War II, played by Dean Jagger. He's about to lose his shirt and his pride. So our intrepid quartet go to work.Irving Berlin's score for White Christmas is about half new songs and the other half from previous scores. That's how it was when you got Irving to work for you. Listen carefully even to the background music. You will not hear one note of a non-Berlin song. One of those songs was a personal favorite of mine, Count Your Blessings Instead of Sheep. I recall in grade school in Brooklyn it was a song that the teachers had us sing in the school assemblies. Little did I know that it was introduced by the guy who proved to be my favorite entertainer. It's a patented philosophical Bing Crosby song that he did best and it serves as a ballad to woo and win Rosie. Bing sings it and then Rosie joins him in the reprise.Danny Kaye has two good numbers. The first The Best Things Happen While Your Dancing is clearly originally for Fred Astaire, though Kaye and Vera Ellen make a lovely couple on the dance floor. The Choreography number I think was also done for Astaire, but here dancer John Brascia does the complicated dance routine while Kaye sings. I'm sure Astaire would have handled both jobs had the film been made with him.All the stars do the Minstrel Show/Mandy number, but Vera Ellen really shines in it. She was a great dancer, really sparkled in every film she did.Besides Sisters, Rosemary Clooney has a grand torch ballad that sold a few platters for her in Love, You Didn't Do Right By Me. She had a wonderful singing voice and the most impeccable diction of any female singer ever. You don't miss one throbbing word on any of her ballads.White Christmas was Paramount's first film done in their wide screen process called VistaVision. And of course it was proper that their number one star for over 20 years be in this film. Of course jokes about Bing's derrière and the wide screen got into the repertoire of a certain comedian named Hope.Just like the song that inspired it, White Christmas has proved to be a timeless holiday classic and will remain so.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1
White Christmas,"White Christmas (1954) ** (out of 4) Simple tale of a song and dance team (Bing Crosby, Danny Kaye) who travel to a rundown Vermont inn owned by their former Army general. They decide to try and bring some new business to the place and they also add a sister act (Rosemary Clooney, Vera-Ellen) to the lineup, which soon leads to romance. By the time this film was released Crosby's song 'White Christmas' was already a legendary classic so I guess it should come as no surprise that someone would try and wrap an entire film around it. I know this film is loved by thousands of people across the world but I wasn't all that impressed with it. For starters, this semi-remake of HOLIDAY INN doesn't hold a candle to anything in that movie. Every single item in the earlier film is much better than anything here so director Michael Curtiz isn't able to match anything. That wouldn't have been a problem had more simply been done here. There's no question that there are some good dance sequences as all four stars really give it their all. I think it would be fair to say that Kaye and Very-Ellen steal the film with their various dance scenes, which are clearly the highlight. There's also no denying that both Crosby and Clooney sound terrific together and they also have a nice spark that works in the romantic scenes. The biggest problem with the film is its screenplay, which is just one cliché after another and it just never sparks to life. It also doesn't help that the majority of the Irving Berlin songs just seem like a poor imitation of something he would write. WHITE Christmas is loved by many and disliked by many so ones mileage is going to vary in regards to how they take the film. I will add that the film, the first shown in VistaVision, at least looks great but you just wish there was a tad bit more meat on the bone.",-1,0,0,-1,0,0,-1
White Christmas,"White Christmas is a solid family musical with one ultra-famous Christmas song sung early on in the proceedings. For the rest of the running time it's a rather typical Hollywood musical of its era: warm, good-natured, with lots of well-choreographed dance and singing routines, and a feel-good storyline. It's not my favourite of its type - I'm a sucker for Gene Kelly - but as a Christmas musical, it shines.Bing Crosby is the obvious draw here as the film belongs to him throughout, but the supporting cast are effective too. Danny Kaye has a fairly difficult role I reckon, playing second-string to Crosby, but he comes off as amiable enough. Rosemary Clooney and Vera Ellen are fine as the singing sisters. Like many of its type, White Christmas flags a little in between the songs, but the musical numbers are well staged and likable, so there's little to complain about overall.",1,1,1,0,1,0,1

They become fast friends with the girls and travel to Vermont for a Christmas show. They find a failing lodge run by their former commander, and decide to save it with a grand show.As a rom-com, it's strictly vanilla flavor. There isn't much heat, and there aren't any surprises. This is really only interesting for the song and dance. And there are some great songs. It's not just the iconic title song, but there are a whole bunch of others also written by Irving Berlin. And that's the real star of this movie. It's a showcase for Irvin Berlin's talents.",1,1,1,0,1,0,1
White Christmas,"I know that people may think me unpatriotic, but the message here is that we need to continue to glorify war. The U.S. had just finished World War II and celebrated a great victory. Now we had the big Commie fear and a trip to Korea where many more of our young people dead. So in 1954 comes a ""Christmas"" movie. It pushes all the right buttons and has the stars of the day, Danny Kaye, Rosemary Clooney, and Bing Crosby (one of the most hawkish performers of all time) and becomes a kind of recruiting poster when we were done with war for a while (of course, we were already meddling in southeast Asia). It does have a decent story and those songs were well performed, but there is no comparison between this and ""Holiiday Inn"" which carries a much more romantic theme, and also stars Bing Crosby. The main thing for me is that at times I just find it sort of dull.",0,1,0,0,0,1,1
White Christmas,"While this film certainly has a cult following, it really can't be counted as 100 percent a Christmas movie. Basically a remake of 1942's ""Holiday Inn"" where the title song from this movie was introduced (and deservedly won an Oscar), it adds color, camp, and Danny Kaye to the familiar story. Danny takes over in the role Fred Astaire played in ""Holiday Inn"", and his character adds comedy into the mix, some funny, some cloying. Technicolor loves Rosemary Clooney and Vera-Ellen, and they wear all sorts of gorgeous gowns. Unfortunately, this mixture of pastiche and Technicolor ends up being an extremely mixed bag that brings huge smiles in some scenes, rolled eyes in others.The campiest moment comes with the duet of ""Sisters"", first seen with Vera-Ellen and Clooney, and later repeated by the mincing Crosby and Kaye. The later version was apparently done as a gag and kept in the film. A big production number saluting the old minstrel shows features the tackiest of jokes and the ugliest of costumes. It worked great in ""Kid Millions"" in 1934, but in the post war world of 1954, it is a major groaner of a number. Even duller is Kaye's ""Choreography"", as pretentious as it sounds. He does get a nice duet with Vera-Ellen, ""The Best Things Happen When You're Dancing"", while Crosby and Clooney get to sing the beautiful ""Count Your Blessings Instead of Sheep"". Clooney gets a good solo moment with ""Love, You Didn't Do Right By Me"", a mediocre song which becomes better simply because of how she sells it.As for the Christmas sequences, they open and end the film, hence the reason for the title. Dean Jagger plays the retiring General who moves to the aforementioned ""Holiday Inn"" after the end of World War II, and is given a rousing send-off. Mary Wickes shines as his housekeeper, but then again, doesn't she always shine no matter what film she's in? The two major Christmas songs are the title song, first repeated by Crosby (who introduced it in ""Holiday Inn"") and later utilized for the lavish finale where the hotel walls open up like a Broadway set. I guess you're supposed to really feel the Christmas spirit when this happens, but had the whole story surrounded the holidays rather than just the opening and conclusion, I would have been much happier. A minor little number, ""Snow"", celebrates the season nicely, but its not one of Berlin's better songs. Michael Curtiz seems an odd choice for director of a big, elephantine musical. This was a busy time for Irving Berlin as he just had another catalog of his songs done on screen (the much better ""There's No Business Like Show Business"") and the previous year's ""Call Me Madam"", both with Ethel Merman. So while he may have been considered, as Jerome Kern called him, ""American Music"", he was represented elsewhere. This musical certainly has its fans, and while I applaud much of what is in here, I have to consider this one a missed opportunity, much like Crosby's next remake of an old film of his, ""Anything Goes"", where the same studio forgot that it was based on an old Cole Porter hit, and equally as disengaging.",1,1,1,0,1,1,1
White Christmas,"A successful song-and-dance team (Bing Crosby and Danny Kaye) become romantically involved with a sister act (Rosemary Clooney and someone else) and team up to save the failing Vermont inn of their former commanding general (Dean Jagger).This is pretty decent film. Despite not having almost anything to do with Christmas, and having two of the ugliest women as female leads (one of whom is beyond anorexica dn the other who was born as a man), and having the relatively unknown Danny Kaye overshadow Bing Crosby... it has enough good moments to carry itself. Kaye is really the reason to watch the film. He is the better dancer, possibly the better singer. The ""Theater"" skit is excellent. I could have done without hearing the ""Sisters"" song so many times (though seeing the men perform it was a nice touch -- even if it is not explained how they had the female voices -- were the ladies lip-syncing all those times?).This probably sums up the film, more or less. While it is quite good as a romance or musical, it is not a strong Christmas film. The story could have taken place at any time and it would hardly have mattered. And, as I understand it, this was the third film that Crosby sings ""White Christmas"" in -- so why is this one deserving of the title and not the other two? Hmm.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1
White Christmas,"If you've read any of my reviews of musicals, then you'll know that not only are they possibly my least favorite kind of movie, but that I watch them mainly to heckle them a la ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"". Among my rude comments this time were: ""You don't think I'm repulsive, do you?"" - Not next to Bob Dole you aren't.(while the old woman is handing out glasses of champagne) ""Champagne?"" - Yes it is.(at the train station) ""Betty left this for you."" - Dear Judy, an alligator bit off my head.As for the sign telling people not to leave cigarette butts and ashes lying around, you just have to blur the scene a little bit to make it say ""butts and asses"". That's an immature thing to do, you say? Well, ""White Christmas"" is a pretty immature movie.As for that comment about Stephen Colbert. When a remake of the horror classic ""Black Christmas"" (considered by many people to be the very first slasher) got released a few years ago, he asserted that it ripped off this movie. In his right-wing commentator persona, he declared something like, if anyone's going to get chased by a psycho killer, it should be Rosemary Clooney. I wonder, would it have swayed his opinion either way to remind him that Rosemary Clooney's nephew stars in movies like ""Syriana""? I should say, however, that George Clooney had a fine-looking aunt.What I mean - as a joke, natch - about carousels taking over is this. A few days ago, I saw the 1956 version of Rodgers and Hammerstein's ""Carousel"" (which I heckled). The next day, I saw ""Carosello napoletano"" (""Neapolitan Carousel"" in English, it was one of Sophia Loren's early movies). Finally, this movie contains numerous references to carousels. Next might there be a movie in which carousels come to life and go all Freddy Krueger on everyone? Yes, I admit that this review barely makes any sense. I just like to do this when reviewing these kinds of movies. I don't like Bing Crosby one bit, while I consider Danny Kaye a genius. But a really cool Christmas movie that I recently saw is ""Silent Night, Deadly Night""; an appropriate one with Halloween approaching. I also recommend the original ""Black Christmas"".",0,1,1,0,1,1,1
White Christmas,"Bing Crosby's most well-loved and Oscar winning Christmas song came from the film Holiday Inn, it became so popular, director Michael Curtiz (Casablanca, Mildred Pierce) was given the job to make a whole film out of it. Basically, in World War II, after leaving the army, Bob Wallace (Crosby) and Phil Davis (Danny Kaye) team up to become successful song and dance stage act, and also manage to get into Broadway as producers. In a night club, Bob is introduced to the Haynes sisters, Betty Haynes (Rosemary Clooney, George's aunt) and Judy (Vera-Ellen) who also sing and dance on stage, who end up following them all the way to a small Vermont lodge. Bob and Phil are really surprised to see their old commanding officer, Major General Thomas F. Waverly (Dean Jagger) as owner of the lodge, but he isn't having much luck with business. They come up with a plan to save his business with a song and dance act they created for Broadway, but brought to the small lodge instead. Obviously things don't go smoothly, there is a rift forming between Bob and Betty, even when they were originally smitten, and happy Phil and Judy try to get them back together. Eventually the whole show is brought together for a big surprise for Waverly as all his soldiers come to the show, and they sing and dance their Christmassy show with the snow falling outside. Also starring Mary Wickes as Emma Allen, John Brascia as John, Anne Whitfield as Susan Waverly and Sig Ruman as Landlord. Some of the dance sequences are fun to watch, and songs like ""The Best Things Happen When You're Dancing"" and ""Geee! I Wish I Was Back in the Army"" are catchy, and the performances are alright. It wasn't a bad film in any way, I did enjoy myself, and I can see why it would be given four stars, but the best part is indeed Crosby's treasured song, for that I would probably watch it again. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Song for ""Count Your Blessings Instead of Sheep"". It was number 37 on The 100 Greatest Musicals, and it was number 17 on The 100 Greatest Christmas Moments. Very good!",1,1,1,1,1,1,1
White Christmas,"Often, repeat viewings of a movie will reward me with a greater appreciation for it, however in the case of ""White Christmas"", the effect may be the opposite, so I might better 'count my blessings' and stop with today's screening. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for nostalgia, but this one appears to have aged rather poorly, perhaps for no other reason than the passage of time and changing tastes.Probably the thing that works against the film the most is the choice of songs that have nothing to do with Christmas or the holiday season. Yes, there's the title song and repeated lines from 'Snow', but what's up with the 'Mandy' dance number and the 'Choreography' routine. Rosemary Clooney's Carousel Club song, ""Love, You Done Me Wrong"" seemed particularly troubling, even though it momentarily fit her situation with the Bingster. Also, another poster on this board had it right about ""What Can You Do With A General"" - I actually picked up the video sleeve to remind me what I was watching.Apart from the actual story, there's no reason not to admire the talent on display by the principals. To my mind, there's no finer singing voice than Bing Crosby's. Danny Kaye is spirited as Bing's partner, but he does tap that arm a bit much in the later going. Clooney's charm manages to come through her reserved character, but the showstopper if there is one would be Vera-Ellen in that 'Mandy' routine, watching leaves one almost as breathless as she should have been while doing it.Except for the title and the packaging, ""White Christmas"" has no claim on the truly great holiday films like ""It's A Wonderful Life"" or the Alastair Sim ""A Christmas Carol"". The only thing I would like to know is if Emma (Mary Wickes) ever did resign from 'Busybody's Anonymous'.",0,1,0,-999,-1,1,-999
White Christmas,"A would-be successor to 1942's ""Holiday Inn"", this film begins and ends with ""Holiday""'s Oscar-winning song ""White Christmas"" but otherwise doesn't have much of a seasonal theme. A song-and-dance team, best friends since their Army days, partner themselves with a tuneful and attractive sister act; together, the frolicsome foursome save a dwindling Vermont inn owned by the boys' favorite General (whom they still salute!). Bing Crosby (with his hand on his hip) looks awfully wooden or unsure of himself here, though he works rather amiably with the looser Danny Kaye. Still, there are no romantic sparks between Crosby and Rosemary Clooney, nor Kaye and Vera-Ellen, which causes the love story half of the picture to be left wanting. The colorful production (though a bit elephantine) is lustrous and glossy, and a few of the musical numbers are fun, yet there isn't enough plot on hand to cover two hours on the clock. The final military celebration seems unnecessarily overblown, but the film's technical aspects and choreography are marvelous. ** from ****",0,1,1,0,1,1,1
White Christmas,"To celebrate Christmas and to pay respects to Mr. Bing Crosby who died a little more than 30 years ago, I decided to watch for the first time in its entirety, White Christmas. This movie made of Irving Berlin songs both old and new, also stars Danny Kaye, Vera-Ellen, Rosemary Clooney, Dean Jagger, and Mary Wickes with some familiar bit players like Herb Vigran and Grady Sutton. Also, George Chakiris, best known as Bernardo in West Side Story, is a dancing extra here. The story of two former army buddies-turned-musical-partners who meet a two sister singing act that's on their way to a lodge owned by the general of the former army pals is just a contrivance to put together various songs to fit in certain segments. Good musical performances abound with some of my favorites being ""Choreography"" with Kaye and Vera-Ellen making fun of Jazz-Ballet and the ""Count Your Blessings"" duet with Crosby and Clooney. While I said the story is pretty contrived, I also was mostly willing to go along with most of it as the performers made it all go down easy with director Michael Curtiz lending a brisk pace throughout. The now-classic song ""White Christmas"" was probably better handled in Holiday Inn by Bing some 12 years before but still, it's a good way to both begin and end this wonderful showcase to Mr. Berlin that's become a holiday classic for the last 50 years. P.S.-The picture that Vera-Ellen show of she and Clooney's brother that served with Bing and Danny is that of former Our Ganger/Little Rascal Carl ""Alfalfa"" Switzer!",1,1,1,1,1,1,1
White Christmas,"Legendary Michael Curtiz directs this showcase of talent in an attempt to capitalize on the song ""White Christmas"" that first appeared in the 1942 classic HOLIDAY INN. Quite innocent and evocative of the early 50's mindset. One of those let's save the day by putting on a show. A song and dance team will help keep their former commanding officer's(Dean Jagger)Vermont inn alive. A real talented cast that includes Bing Crosby, Danny Kaye, Rosemary Clooney, Vera-Ellen, John Brascia and Anne Whitefield. How can you have Bing Crosby and not hear his ""White Christmas""? Other memorable tunes: ""The Best Things Happen When You're Dancing"", ""Count Your Blessing Instead of Sheep"" and ""Snow"".Note: Curtiz four years later would direct Jagger in the Elvis Presley classic KING CREOLE.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1
White Christmas,"Old Army buddies Bob and Phil become a hugely successful song and dance act once the war is over. Taking a much needed vacation to Vermont, they are saddened to find that the ski lodge run by their old wartime General is due to be closed down on account of the lack of snow in the area. Falling in with two lovely sisters, Betty & Judy, the boys plan to put on a variety show with the girls to entice people back to the lodge. But misunderstandings and romantic leanings are not going to make this at all easy.Enduring, perennial, simple and beguiling are all words fit to be associated with White Christmas. It's directed by Mr Reliable, Michael Curtiz, features songs from Irving Berlin and stars Bing Crosby, Danny Kaye, Rosemary Clooney, Vera-Ellen & Dean Jagger. Filmed in Technicolor, it's also notable for being the first film to be shot in VistaVision (think wide-screen process). In truth the film is thinly plotted and doesn't remotely feature some of Berlin's best tunes, and I dare to be a touch more critical as the VistaVision is wasted on the studio led direction. Yet it's such a charming and heart warming film it feels churlish to let the negatives negate the over riding feeling of having been cheered after a viewing.So although it's not the brilliance it perhaps should have been, it's ultimately a picture that still reels in new viewers every yuletide year, and that's something that is hard to argue with. So enjoy the title song and the likes of ""Sisters,"" ""The Best Things Happen When You're Dancing,"" ""Count Your Blessings Instead Of Sheep"" & ""Love, You Didn't Do Right By Me"". Marvel at the zippiness of Vera-Ellen's dancing whilst lapping up the side-kick goofiness provided by the always watchable Kaye. Be emotionally involved with Dean Jagger's heavy hearted General, and of course there's Crosby too, seemingly ageless, he croons and simultaneously manages to melt the ice in your drink as you snuggle up by the fire.Delightful. 7/10",1,1,1,1,1,1,1
White Christmas,"The music of Irving Berlin, one of America's most distinguished composers of the 20th century, is at the center of this pleasant holiday film, that if one is to judge by the comments submitted to this forum, is a perennial favorite of audiences that discover this charming movie, or just go back to visit from time to time.Directed by Michael Curtiz, a versatile man; he was at ease with drama as well as comedy, or musicals. He shows a light touch that helps make this a cherished film for movie fans of all ages. Based on material by another great team, Norman Panama, Norman Krasna and Melvin Frank, the movie is light as a feather. The film is sort of a variation on the theme, ""let's put on a show"", or even, ""if we stage it, they will come"", we know how it will end, but we feel good, and enjoy it even though we know the plot by heart.The main reason for watching, besides Mr. Berlin's wonderful tunes, is hearing those standard songs delivered by the likes of Bing Crosby and Rosemary Clooney, who were at the top of their careers. They had such wonderful and melodious voices, they enhance the songs they interpret. The story is just a pretext to bring together the talented principals plus Danny Kaye, Vera Ellen, Dean Jagger, and the marvelous Mary Wickes, in a film that will delight anyone, anytime, but especially at Christmas.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1
White Christmas,"If it weren't for a few good song-and-dance routines, some great looking scenes at a Vermont lodge, and the fabulous Rosemary Clooney delivering some real professional song numbers, 'White Christmas' would be a forgettable, routine bit of Holiday fare.The trouble is--even though everything is all prettied up in technicolor and the cast includes four pros like Danny Kaye, Bing Crosby, Vera-Ellen and Rosemary Clooney, there is an artificial flavor to the sugary script--as well as a weak performance by Danny Kaye who is usually so non-stop great.
When the Irving Berlin numbers take center stage everything is all right--but the minute they're over we're stuck with the dreary plot that begins in a highly artificial stagebound set supposed to be a war zone and ends in an equally artificial and artless manner when a barn door is opened to reveal the fake snow of a Vermont winter while our stars wear their Santa caps and do a reprise of the title song. It's all so obviously contrived and manipulated to bring tears in celebration of a plot to have the retired General and proprietor of the lodge (Dean Jagger) honored by fellow servicemen. Too much false sentiment cannot dim the charm of some of the song numbers, however. The film's greatest strength are the Berlin tunes sprinkled throughout: ""Count Your Blessings"", ""The Best Things Happen While You're Dancing"", ""Sisters"", and a wonderful torch number performed to the hilt by Rosemary Clooney (the title of which escapes me at the moment!)
The most surprising moment of the film occurs when Vera-Ellen and Danny Kaye dance gracefully to ""The Best Things Happen While You're Dancing"", the kind of number one would expect Fred Astaire to do with such ease. But Kaye is exceptionally talented here, matching the professional moves of Vera-Ellen with verve and fine form. It's too bad the rest of his performance lacks his customary comic flair, except for the ""in drag"" routine, ""Sisters"", performed with an uncomfortable looking Bing Crosby.Way below the standards one expects from a film directed by the great Michael Curtiz. It sure has a handsome look to it in technicolor--but except for a few good Berlin tunes, the story is as phony as the artificial snow the size of tennis balls that falls at the finale.",0,1,1,1,1,1,1
White Christmas,"Two old army buddies (Bing Crosby, Danny Kaye) are a successful dancing and singing act. They try to help their ex-general (Dean Jagger) from loosing his Vermont inn. The love interest is provided by Vera Ellen and Rosemary Clooney.I've seen this multiple times (once in a brand new print at a repertory theatre)--and I've never really liked it. It starts off great with Crosby singing the title song to soldiers during WWII--that scene really works and is quietly powerful--but then the film falls to pieces. The script is--to be nice--pretty terrible with a totally predictable plot and tired comedy. None of the actors are given roles to play. Kaye seems lost and Clooney and Ellen try to inject life into their characters. Jagger is also far too mild-mannered to play a tough Army general. Only Crosby with his easy-going charm and Mary Wickes (with the few funny lines) really pull off any acting. The songs are pretty unmemorable--""What Can You Do With a General"" has got to be one of the all time worst songs I've heard in a movie. All the sets look impressive--but they're very obviously sets--especially the outdoor ones. And there's no snow or anything Christmas-like until the last 5 minutes! This film does have its good points. It was the first film shot in VistaVision (a wide screen process) and the movie takes full advantage of it with a few elaborate production numbers in bright beautiful Technicolor. Also Kaye and Crosby do have a funny number in drag (sort of) and the beautiful, bright color and some interesting costumes keep you mildly interested. All the singing is good and some of the dancing is just incredible (especially with Ellen).But all in all this is too long (a half hour could have been chopped off), too slow and too badly written for me to like it. Give me ""It's A Wonderful Life"" or ""Holiday Inn"" over this. I give this a 5.",0,-1,-1,-999,1,-999,1
White Christmas,"Once again I appear to have watched a different film from the majority of posters making it a contest between the hard to please and the easily pleased. I watched it as I watch any and every movie i.e. with the best of intentions and hoping to like more than I dislike. On paper it had plenty going for it beginning with the score. Given that it's a Berlin score we know going in that 1) there will be a healthy slug of his back catalogue melded to a handful of new material and 2) that there's absolutely no danger of us mistaking it for Porter sophistication, Hart wit, Arlen verve and that schmaltz and sentiment will be the order of the day. That's fine. No one's trying to put anything over on us, we know it's going to be The Sound Of Music without the nuns and the kids so let's sit back and let it unspool. Crosby is usually a good bet and when he's teamed with Astaire he's an even better bet. Fred couldn't make it this time around so after trying everyone else they finally settled for Danny Kaye which would also be fine but not, of course, Slyvia Fine, with whose words and music he is most comfortable. It was probably asking too much to expect Kaye to play it straight so we keep getting the Kays schtick whether we like it or not. Rosemary Clooney is adequate as one of the female leads but Vera Ellen has never quite convinced as leading lady material and nor does she here. For acting we have Dean Jagger who is so good he tends to overbalance things. Pleasant? Sure. Engaging? Well ... Painless? More or less.",0,1,1,0,1,1,0

I'm not into musicals, generally, and this doesn't ever rise above average as far as the music goes. Most of the songs just feel shoehorned into the movie, ending up with some pretty lame lyrics and scenes.

White Christmas,"This movie is a Christmas tradition with me. But there is something strange about its allure. It's wonderful between Thanksgiving and Christmas, then on December 26th, it is like the Christmas tree. It turns from a glimmering tribute to the season into a bunch of dead pine needles that you want to haul to the pavement as soon as possible.Maybe that is because there are no bad guys in this film, it is pure good will, pure nostalgia - even in 1954 it was pure nostalgia - nostalgia for the men who had been soldiers in an all out fight for saving the planet from forces of pure evil just ten years before.

There's old pro Bing Crosby whose voice and demeanor warm any film, Danny Kaye's nervous exaggerated presence and Bing's old army buddy and now song and dance partner, Vera Ellen floating on air in all of her dance segments - and look at that waist..if you can find it!. Finally there is iconic 50s songstress Rosemary Clooney rounding out the cast.Dean Jagger plays the general and former commanding officer of Crosby and Kaye who has sunk all of his savings into a Vermont ski inn - except global warming seems to be parked overhead. Then there is great character actress Mary Wickes as the inn housekeeper whose bad habit of eavesdropping on the extension almost throws a fatal monkey wrench into what has up to that point been just been too happy of a film.

Ma Rainey's Black Bottom,"I never read the source this was based on. But Denzel Washington (who already used the writer for another movie he made, that he and Viola starred in, she's back in front of the camera, he's ""just"" producing) takes it upon himself to make the works known to a new audience. Some of whom may not be inclined to read (not judging either way).We get treated to some wonderful performances - especially the late, sorely missed and way too soon taken away from us Chadwick Boseman. There is Buzz about him get at least an Oscar nomination, possibly even a win. Something he is most deserving of and he has proven not just in this movie. As light and fun as he was in interviews, as intense and craftful he is in front of the camera. I said it when I watched the James Brown movie (get on up) he made - that performance was more than worthy of any acting award on this planet! Will he win for this, which is more of an assemble piece? We will see if he gets this recognition even if way too late for my liking.But back to this and a dark chapter. This is not happy go lucky, this is and depicts racism in many forms. And how some artists back then tried to fight back. Not that they were without flaws (Viola or rather the character she portrays has her own demons to fight with) - clashing here are too hot heads with a past and a present. Both stirred up by other factors, unable to lash out at those factors (mostly drawn and set up by white folk), unleash on each other.Not something that is fun to watch when it happens, but early on we can see how deep the wounds of Chadwicks character are ... literally and figuratively speaking. The amount of work he again put into this - but we had that already and this shall not take anything away from the others involved here ... their commitment and their acting is matching his ... they had to I guess.From that standpoint this is superb filmmaking .. the pacing and the tone might not bode well with some though ... but this is not here to make friends. It is not here to be light entertainment ... it is here to remind everyone, what our past had in store for us, so we won't make the same mistakes again ... hopefully. We are people and none of us is superior to others because of the color of our skin (to be clear, I am talking about racism which obviously was done mainly by white people ... and unfortunately under the still residing POTUS is running wild again) ...",1,1,1,1,1,1,0
Ma Rainey's Black Bottom,"I was thinking at first - please note at first for like the first ten to twenty minutes - with Chadwick Boseman's performance at Levee, ""yeah, this is good, actually perceptive when it comes to an artist's bragodoccio and sense of self when they know they got the goods at what they do - but I didn't necessarily think that it was a truly great performance (if anything I was still preferring his James Brown as far as giants of Black music). He was doing justice for Wilson'd words if not going above and beyond. And then...There came that monologue about a third of the way in about taking it or saying yes or no to and from white people, where Levee came from, and it transcended the space and time of where he was. He even went past the solid if basic close-up that director George chose for the majority of this moment and pierces your soul. Practically every Black person in America has that right at their door with white people - and how Boseman superlatively channels Levee's pain and resolve and how he's maybe or maybe not come to terms with that (and this also sets up his ferocious and usually righteous anger throughout) is Exhibit A as to why he was so special as an actor. I look forward to the likely event of him becoming one of the small handful of performers to receive an Oscar posthumously.Oh, and Viola Davis is pretty damn good too, in a role that very easily can call for eating everything on set for lunch, but she manages to bring it down to this being a human being with a sense of why she is who she is in the world. Domingo (who was superb in Beale Street) and Turman are excellent in supporting roles. 8.5/10",1,1,1,0,0,1,1
Ma Rainey's Black Bottom,"The late August Wilson is celebrated for his 'Philadelphia' cycle of ten plays all but one of which are set in his home town, the city of brotherly love. The exception is this one, which was the first in the cycle and is set in Chicago where four black musicians are waiting for the legendary blues singer Ma Rainey who is late for her date to cut two sides - the time is 1927 when discs were made of shellac. All of Wilson's work explores the 'black' experience and this is no exception and trumpet player Chadwick Boseman (in what turned out to be his final film) loses no time needling the other three and the 'N' word is flung about liberally. Although Viola Davis has the eponymous role it is Boseman who has the lion's share of the dialogue yet at the end of the day it remains a powerful piece of ensemble acting.",1,1,1,0,0,1,0
Ma Rainey's Black Bottom,"Greetings again from the darkness. As an Executive Producer, Denzel Washington has pledged to bring 10 August Wilson plays (collectively known as 'The Pittsburgh Cycle' or 'Century Cycle') to cinema. The first was the Oscar-nominated FENCES (2016), and George C Wolf directs this, the second. Ruben Santiago-Hudson has adapted Wilson's 1984 play into a feature film vehicle for some of the finest on screen acting we will see this year.Viola Davis (Oscar winner, FENCES) stars as Gertrude ""Ma"" Rainey, the ""Mother of Blues"", and the recently deceased Chadwick Boseman co-stars as Levee, her ambitious trumpet player. Ms. Davis delivers a towering performance, and Mr. Boseman leaves us with his career best. The film opens in 1927 rural Georgia with two African-Americans running through the woods under the cover of darkness. If your mind goes where my mind did, we are both wrong. They are headed to a shack acting as a nightclub, and we get our first look and listen at Ma belting out a tune. It's a powerful image and one that expertly sets the tone.Soon we are in Chicago as Ma's band makes their way to a recording studio. Cutler (Colman Santiago, IF BEALE STREET COULD TALK, 2018) plays the trombone and is the de facto leader, Toledo (Glynn Turman, ""Fargo"") is the piano player, and Slow Drag (Michael Potts) plays the bass. The three older men all arrive on time at the studio and are waiting on trumpet player Levee (Boseman) and Ma. When Levee does show up, he struts into the rehearsal room and flashes his new shoes. The generational difference is immediate evident, and the fiery banter is superb. Levee is charming and cocky, while the older men are wise from experience and have undoubtedly seen dozens of Levees throughout their years. Cutler's strong religious beliefs become known and Toledo's sage advice falls on deaf ears.Ma literally crashes into the scene, and we quickly understand that this woman will apologize for nothing, and has earned the right to call her own shots - even if that's only true in this one corner of the universe. She understand the power her record sales give her, and she seizes every possible upper hand - whether it's which arrangement to sing on a song, allowing her stuttering nephew to record, or even demanding a cold coca-cola before singing. Ma speaks in third person and her attitude is not that of a warm, grateful person, but rather of a woman who understands what she has earned. When she says, ""All they want is my voice"", we know exactly what she means.More collisions occur, this time figuratively. There is a collision of swagger between Ma and Levee. The collision of generations with Levee and the band. Finally, there is the collision of Levee and the white man. Ma wants to sing her songs on the record the way she sings them for her fans, while Levee is pushing for the ""new"" up-tempo sound. Levee's ambition for songwriting and putting together his own band clashes with the older musicians who are satisfied to be working, and Levee tries to play the game by playing up to the white men in power, only to be taught the lesson that his bandmates tried to warn him of.Wilson is known for his speeches, and the key players get their moment. Toledo describes blacks as ""the leftovers"", while Ma describes white people listening to the blues ... ""They hear it come out, but they don't know how it got there."" These are powerful moments, yet standing above them are the two soliloquies we hear from Levee. The first is about his background of family and introduction to white men, while the second is truly an other-worldly cinematic moment - he contests the unwavering religious beliefs in what ultimately proves to be the most tragic way. It's a scene which will be Mr. Boseman's long-lasting acting legacy.Supporting work is provided by Jeremy Shamos as Ma's agent Irvin, Taylour Paige as another line in the sand between Ma and Levee, Dusan Brown as Ma's nephew, and Jonny Coyne as the studio owner/producer. This is not so much a story, but rather inspiration for us to assemble the various pieces into the backstories of these characters. It's a way for us to better understand what they did to get here, and how they are handling it now. Step on the shoes at your own peril. When someone overcomes so much in life, they aren't likely to back down gently. The music is terrific, the message is strong, and the performances are unforgettable.

Ma Rainey's Black Bottom,"""Blues help you get out of bed in the morning."" Ma Rainey (Viola Davis)Ma Rainey looks like she would get up on the wrong side of that bed, but she sure can sing the blues on either side. In Netflix's Ma Rainey's Black Bottom, Davis plays another survivor, this one the opposite of her submissive wife to Denzel's domineering husband in August Wilson's Fences (1985 play).Washington produces this 1982 Wilson play, and he casts another strong Black actor, Chadwick Bozeman, to play Ma's feisty young horn player. Because Levee wants arrangements of their blues to be fleet with the spirit and pace of jazz, he gets the white promoters to back him, to little avail because Ma wants it her old way. Negotiating with the charismatic Ma or even playing music doesn't happen until she gets her ""ice-old"" Coca Cola. Old school prevails even if Levee is right.The natural tension between stasis and progress allows Bozeman to act half-crazed and inspired, a tour de force performance fitting for his last one before his death. Amazing is his acting range from a cool leader in Black Panther to a hothead in this drama. He has a minimum of two extended speeches, one almost five minutes about a disturbing crime he witnessed and his father's revenge on the perpetrators. I challenge you to go to the fridge during these impassioned pleas for justice.It's not difficult to see Levee carrying on the angry legacy of his father in a world on the brink of massive racism as Blacks migrate to the North and its entrenched resistance. Ma's players are constantly negotiating for payment from the white business manager and recording studio owner, both of whom are capitalists, not humanists.As in Wilson's Fences, the action takes place in only two spaces, here in a recording studio and in a basement practice room for a 1927 Chicago recording session. A brief foray onto the street brings more conflict, as if there weren't enough inside.Ma Rainey's Black Bottom is made for stage or film because the dialogue is electric and human. Sometimes the vernacular and rapid pace are challenging to understand; well, then, just rewind or use closed caption: ""They hear it (blues) come out, but they don't know how it got there. They don't understand that that's life's way of talking."" (Ma)Ma says it all about black/white conflict and the tensions of artistic creativity: ""They gonna treat me the way I want to be treated no matter how much it hurt 'em."" It's tough out there, 1927 or 2020.",1,1,0,1,0,1,1
Ma Rainey's Black Bottom,"""Sporting Ma's oleaginous, smudgy war paint and flamboyant outfit, Davis goes for broke in the prima donna default (her singing is dubbed, right?), Ma can't suffer gladly anyone who doesn't bend to her biddings, neither the subservient manager Irvin (Shamos), the dour-looking producer Sturdyvant (Coyne), nor those who have the same pigmentation like hers. Being a colored woman who make good in the societal echelon, she has the clout to be nobody's doormat, her pride festering into conceit and her pertinacious insistence of equal respect making her egocentric (giving white lickspittles a taste of their own medicine, she can also stand pat with nepotism). It is interesting that there is no love lost between Ma and Levee, under any mitigated circumstances, the pair could have hit it off and put their talents together into greater use. Yet, can't we not relate to Ma? Anyone in her position will be none the wiser, her bluntness and high-handedness reflects how she manages to cope with a vastly unjust, racist world at large, Davis again, amps up the decibel and bulldozes any obstruction with her utterly transfixing verve and flexibility.""reading my full review on my blog: cinema omnivore",1,-999,-999,-999,-999,-999,-999
Ma Rainey's Black Bottom,"""Ma Rainey's Black Bottom"" based on an award winning play is one to watch for some brash outspoken words as it's a showcase for blues freedom while dealing with race and life. Set in 1927 Chicago, the great Ma Rainey(in a transformative role from Viola Davis) takes the windy city by storm with demands as she's still hot from the south. Along side her is her band and main female squeeze, yet the wild card and scene stealer is her young go against the grain band player the scorned and new ideal kind of jazz guy Levee(the late Chadwick Boseman who will win an Oscar) develops a wicked power struggle with all. Be careful Ma as this little hot rod even makes a play for your girl. The scenes and script are powerful it really rubs on your emotions and the singing and the words are deep and powerful really strong words of the blues. Really this picture is a fine wonderful homage to the powerful days of the blues one that any film buff or music historian should view.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1
Ma Rainey's Black Bottom,"""Ma Rainey's Black Bottom"" is certainly of interest as biopic of the ""Mother of the Blues"" Ma Rainey (as played by Viola Davis) and for the last great screen performance from the late Chadwick Boseman as the fictional trumpeter Levee in Ma's band. Beyond this, it's partly hindered as an extension of the stage in the same way that Denzel Washington's adaptation of another of August Wilson's Pittsburg Cycle of plays, ""Fences"" (2016), was, but this adaptation by Ruben Santiago-Hudson and directed by Goerge C. Wolfe, although still including Washington as a producer, largely transcends its staginess by reflexively being about the process of adapting stage performance to recorded media, from musical concert to recording session--just as the movie is a recorded adaptation from live theatre. Unlike most filmed plays, its theatricality reflects its narrative.Moreover, it's set in 1927, which, whether or not the filmmakers intended the allusion, was also the year of the film ""The Jazz Singer,"" the heralded first feature-length synchronized sound film and film musical. Apt for a Netflix release about recording music, and, more than that, ""The Jazz Singer,"" among other things, is also about what today might be more-politely termed cultural appropriation, as evidenced most notoriously in the blackface sequence. That 1927 film is about the clashing and harmonizing of cultures in general, really: part silent and part talkie, Judaism and show business, the whiteness of the film's jazz singer and the origins of the music from black musicians as called attention to in the controversial blackface worn by Al Jolson. Point is, some of the same issues are brought up in ""Ma Rainey's Black Bottom.""Boseman's Levee wants to play his own, jazzier, more-swinging music as opposed to performing in Ma Rainey's ""jug band,"" while at the same time there's no denying the influence of her blues on the history of popular music, including collaborating with the likes of Louis Armstrong and Bessie Smith. Ma also retains her own voice, whereas ""Baby, Let Me Have It All"" (which with its ""jelly rolls"" makes me think of Jelly Roll Morton, in addition to how raunchy these old tunes about ""rolls"" and the titular ""bottom"" are, but I digress) is coopted by a white band and studio owner. Besides this, the characters take part in a series of theatrical monologues and dialogues on racial issues, religion and other matters, and there's Ma's reported homosexual relationships, one of which was rumored to be with Smith. Again, such a connection may've not been intended--indeed, such an artifact of Jewish identity and white culture would be out of place here in a sense--but the parallels are manifold and felicitous in the sense of cinematic heritage.Although its reflexivity, including a particular focus on the technical aspects of recording, are what raises this title above a mere filmed play, the costumes and production design also help, and there are a few different locales beyond the record studio to open the play up. Even the cinematography of the sweat on the figures' faces throughout the exhausting performances and hot-summer recording session recommends itself. The opening concert scene is a standout, and it, reportedly, includes the one bit of Davis doing her own singing. The rest said to be performed for by soul singer Maxayn Lewis. The same sources say Boseman actually learned to play the trumpet, although I would be surprised if his playing weren't also aided by modern sound-recording tricks. Regardless, Davis and Boseman headline a superb overall cast. Davis is especially imposing in looking the part of a legendary historical figure. And Boseman is surely the sentimental favorite for a posthumous Oscar this year, and his performance might just very well deserve it. There are a couple moments that are overly stagy--the more sudden outbursts of speechifying in particular, but even that may be followed by a helluva powerful monologue such as of Levee's story of his childhood. Overall, his performance transcends any fun-loving jazzcat stereotype in a similar vein to the picture overcoming its being a filmed play. The business with Levee's obsession with that ""trap"" door is a neat metaphor in both respects. He and his character become artists. It's a moving conclusion to a career tragically cut far too short. Yet, just as records immortalized the blues singing of Ma Rainey, or these adaptations have done for August Wilson's plays, motion pictures have done likewise for the artistry of Chadwick Boseman.",1,1,0,1,1,1,1
Ma Rainey's Black Bottom,"The first installment of August Wilson adaptations backed by Denzel Washington since 2016's very well received Fences, Ma Rainey's Black Bottom has taken on a whole new significance as a cinematic product due to the untimely and heartbreaking loss of its star Chadwick Boseman.This time only contributing to the film by a producing reign, with directional duties falling to George C. Wolfe, Washington's collection of films may never take on such an added significance as Black Bottom does to showcase the exceptional talents of a performer taken far too soon, in what is an awards caliber performance in a production that thrives with his presence but lacks in other areas, making Wolfe's stagey adaptation an intense watch but not one that is likely to linger.Sticking very much too Wilson's original text that features real life singer Ma Rainey (a showy and very sweaty Viola Davis) featuring in a fictional tale that takes place in a recording studio in Chicago on a hot Summer's day in 1927, Black Bottom at times enthralls as we watch Rainey's band bicker and banter around her tardy recording studio session, with Boseman's sassy and talented horn player Levee exploring his past and talking about his future in a landscape that wasn't one to provide a fair playing field.Founded on some incredible monologues about his parents and God's seeming abandonment in his life, Boseman may've well known this could be one of his last chances to showcase his skills in a film and he saves one of his best turns till last.Knowing what we know now, its clear to see Boseman's physical appearance and ever wide smile showing chinks and scars of a man battling an horrific disease but his charisma and energy is still there to see and its not going to be at all surprising to see the well-loved performer appear in many awards ceremonies in the coming months with this turn here far more memorable than his overrated work in the unduly praised Da 5 Bloods.The rest of Wolfe's film outside of Boseman's commanding turn doesn't leave much to write home about, Davis is her typically assured self even if her singing scenes don't come off as totally convincing and the films period costumes and production design is high class but there's not a lot within this product as a movie that does anything much a stage play couldn't of done with previous Wilson offering Fences managing to make itself feel bigger than its small confines through smartly designed direction and a more focused narrative.At days end Black Bottom tackles some always timely issues of race and is a fitting swansong to a great talent but its not a film that is deserving of any of the extra praise its poised to get due to the surrounding circumstances of its release.Final Say -This latest Netflix prestige drama is more proficient than we've come to expect from the streaming service but despite its fine central performances, Ma Rainey's Black Bottom is still lacking a certain magic and scope that would've made it a truly deserving awards contender.3 1/2 stuttering nephews out of 5",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Ma Rainey's Black Bottom,"One of the decades (20s) covered in his monumental ""century cycle,"" August Wilson's Ma Rainey's Black Bottom is the only one located outside of Pittsburgh (Chicago) but remains rife with the same themes and issues plaguing Steel Town as well as the country in that particular decade that still resonates in some form in this day and age.Ma Rainey (Viola Davis) is a diva of the first rank who likes to throw her weight around as well as shock polite society. Difficult and demanding she drives the penny pinching producers and her back-up band to frustration with petty complaints and hissy fits. One band member, Levee a hot shot trumpeter, (Chadwick Boseman) with confidence who thinks he has a future particularly irks her since he's making time with her younger companion.Davis' stunning Ma dominates the film with a raw and unsympathetic power that you may or may not sympathize with, the method to her madness of having the whip hand explained in terse logic. She is only half of the film however with Boseman and the band sharing the other and they fail to jell as a unit in a dramatic way leading up to the film's brutal climax, with the banter between the quartet for the most part stagey and perfunctory.Well edited early, the third act lumbers under George Wolfe's mediocre direction around the band and the producers while Ruben Santiago Hudson's screenplay adds a few ""MFs"" to Wilson's play with little noticeable improvement. A tacked on prologue featuring Paul Whiteman and a pasty white band tackling a purloined Levee composition adds little other than the director punching his Hollywood ""woke"" card.Like the previously filmed Fences, Rainey is an admirable attempt to reach a wider audience by way of the big screen, out of its element. I saw the stage play in 86 and it was one tense evening of theatre. The film naturally sacrifices intimacy and the claustrophobic nature of the play loses some of the speed off of its fastball but Davis larger than life Ma makes it a memorable session.",0,1,0,0,-999,1,0

Ma Rainey's Black Bottom,"IN BRIEF: Two powerful performances and the words of August Wilson make this film must-see viewing.JIM'S REVIEW: (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED) As motherhood goes, Ma Rainey is not the most nurturing kind. She wants what she wants and will use her clout to get it, sucking all the air in the room and suffocating those anywhere near her vicinity. And Ma Rainey's Black Bottom is an excellent film that puts its character center stage, making demands and expecting those around her to jump to it and listen.Shrewdly adapted by Ruben Santiago-Hudson from August Wilson's Tony-nominated play, we are transported to a recording studio in Chicago, 1927. It is there that Ma and her band meet to do a session together and, in the process, we glimpse the racial unrest. Tensions rises as a talented horn player named Levee (Chadwick Boseman) wants to re-orchestrate Ma's tunes to a younger crowd, but Ma won't have it, even as her white producers try to change her mind and control the ""Mother of the Blues"".But there's no controlling her...or Viola Davis in a terrific performance as a talented Black woman who wants her dues (and a Coke). The caked-on eye make-up and over-the-top stance accentuates the years of anguish that this character endured and Ms. Davis takes control of this unlikable show biz diva. It is a bold and commanding performance that never wants your sympathies. Providing the needed conflict is the late Mr. Boseman in his final role.And what a way to be remembered! This is the role that delivers his personal best and cements his legendary career as an accomplished actor. His exhilarating performance is thrilling to behold. Up against Ms. Davis, he creates a bitter and complex character that is all charm and hidden rage. Mr. Boseman's masterful line delivery and anguished face in his many tirades tells it all. The actor crystalizes Levee's dangerous swagger to amazing effect. These are two of the best performances one will see this year.Giving ample support are Colman Domingo, Michael Potts, Jonny Coyne as his bandmates. But foremost is veteran actor Glynn Turman as Toledo. His primary speech is truly moving and a sadly accurate observation by the gifted playwright. The actor nails his shining moment and then some.In fact, there is much speechifying in this drama and the able cast is consistently strong. And that is a testament to Mr. Wilson's great prose. His numerous monologues are sheer poetry and their insights about racial oppression are memorable. Screenwriter Santiago-Hudson is wise to let Wilson's words be. He does respect his source and those glorious words do resonate and underscore years of unrest most eloquently.However, I do think that there are some minor flaws in this important film. George C. Wilson does a solid job directing this work of art. He crafts his film gloriously, with Ann Roth's period costumes and Bradford Marsalis' jazz-infused score. But try as he may to open up the play, it's still has a nagging staginess to it. Where Mr. Wolfe is most successful is his repeated use of close-ups which allows his ensemble to speak and be heard. The film is also a tad anti-climatic and could have had more impact in its final moments. More scenes outside the studio could have strengthened and lengthen this film, giving moviegoers more atmosphere and added details of the era. But these concerns are slight.In Ma Rainey's Black Bottom. all the hurt, pain, and torment is on full display. Thanks to a fine cast and Mr. Wilson's enthralling dialog, this film sings the blues most powerfully. One of the year's best. (GRADE: B+)",1,1,1,1,1,1,1
Ma Rainey's Black Bottom,"Sadly sometimes it's not until an actor dies that they are truly appreciated for how good they were when they were alive and Chadwick Boseman is one such actorThis was his last ever performance and you can see how gaunt he is with cancer but that doesn't stop him giving everything and putting in a brilliant performance.Talking of brilliant performances , Viola Davis is amazing as Ma Rainey in what I believe , to be her best role to date .
You can definitely tell that this was originally a play . It's dialogue heavy and nearly entirely set in a recording studio yet it transfers pretty well to the big screen .
Viola Davis is just stunning as she lays everything on the table as Ma Rainey . From her overweight, sweaty demeanour to the way she gulps down bottles of coke , she is a magnificent .
You can tell she is influenced by Denzel Washington, who is a producer on this film. Even her mannerism are Washington esq.
I'ts without doubt , in my opinion, the best acting performance of 2020.If I had to criticise this film in any way it's just part where Levee does something to Toledo and it seems a little extreme and over the top for the character.This is one example where all the performances are better than the whole of film itself.Not that the film is in anyway bad .

Ma Rainey's Black Bottom,"A ballad for blue's
A performance to last a lifetime.Ma Rainey's Black Bottom brought in fresh air for 2020, to sit back and be captured by great performances, great writing, and most of all, the blues.To start, the cast of Ma Rainey is a cast you could only dream of. Every performance is filled with so many layers, all complex and so intriguing. They all have a rhythm with each other, a ""vibe"" if you would. It's the type of vibe of co-workers that both like and dislike each other. But none of them could steal the show like the late Chadwick Boseman as Levee.Boseman gave his best performance of his career, at the end of his life. His portrayal of the rebellious trumpet player makes you laugh, cry, and downright afraid of him. I can't remember when an actor could make any of us feel like that. Boseman opens up and is transformed with energy, fire, and of course a trumpet.Viola Davis, who plays the titular ""Mother of the Blues"", is unrecognizable in this role. Truly giving her all to portray the diva with love, truth, and power. Her singing is exceptionally smooth and takes you away for brief moments, moments for injustice, the emotional monologues, and allows you to enjoy the music.George C. Wolfe's smart direction lets the actors play the music of August Wilson's words while giving powerful symbols of racial injustice in America.This film may be about Ma Rainey herself, but it is ultametly about Boseman, a man whose performances changed the world. This may be his last performances, but this is a performance to last a lifetime.Thank you Chadwich Boseman, for everything.",1,1,0,1,1,1,0

Ma Rainey's Black Bottom,"A very good film in the style of another famous August Wilson adaptation, Fences. A stage adaptation that serves for many aspects. An interesting artist biopic, a story about human rights and the dark sides of fame in a way. Its beautifully shot and excellently performed. Viola Davis is fantastic as Ma Rainey, a very self-confident singer who is a true Diva. The magic of Davis' performance is that she did not make her cartoonish, which could have easily happened, but behind that self confidence, she gave he role something vulnerable. Excellent and absolutely award worthy. Also Chadwick Boseman's sadly final performance is a real triumph. He gave everything with this performance. There are at least three scenes that went under my skin, and primarily because of how he played and portrayed this quite twisted character.
Good supporting performances by Glyn Turman and Colman Domingo round up this exceptional ensemble. The direction was fine, the look was great and very authentic.

Ma Rainey's Black Bottom,"What a character blues singer Ma Rainey must have been! A capricious diva, but also a woman who knew what she wanted and just went for it. The fact that she lived in the 1920's makes her personality even more special: in those times, black women were not supposed to tell men what to do, let alone white men.'Ma Rainey's Black Bottom' is about music and about race relations. It shows the blues singer preparing for a recording session in Chicago. She is in command, the white manager and producer must do as she says. But her trumpet player is, so to speak, also the victim of her strong opinions. He doesn't get the chance to introduce modern innovations to the old blues songs, because she wants to continue singing them the traditional way.The acting is the main attraction in this movie. Viola Davis gives everything she's got in creating the larger-than-life character of Ma Rainey. The more complex part of the psychologically tormented trumpet player is played by the late Chadwick Boseman, who gives a more nuanced and multi-faceted performance.The emphasis is indeed on the acting, because this is an adapted stage play. Usually, I'm not a fan of adapting plays for the big screen, because both are fundamentally different forms of art. In a good movie the images tell the story, in a play it's the dialogue. 'Ma Rainey's Black Bottom' has all the shortcomings of an adapted play: there are very few scenes outside the recording studio, and almost no scenes that don't rely on dialogue.That being said, I enjoyed the movie because of its style (the clothes are great, the music is terrific), its vibrancy and the acting performances. Both Davis and Boseman could be on their way to an Oscar, in Boseman's case a posthumous one.By the way, don't miss the documentary which accompanies the film on Netflix. It gives a lot of insight in the historical background of the movie.",1,1,0,1,1,1,1
Ma Rainey's Black Bottom,"Ma Rainey certainly feels theatrical, with the actors and their dialogue driving everything in the movie. It ends up working well here, thanks to an excellent ensemble led by a dynamic performance from Boseman. It will take an exceptional turn from Hopkins to unseat Boseman for best actor, and I hope this year's race isn't looked back on as awarding Boseman because he died, for this is a fantastic and deserving performance. It's great to see Boseman go against his usual typecast of a golden boy fighting through adversity, and he shows remarkable range from the emotional turmoil of his past to the energy he brings to his music. Davis is definitely good, though I don't think she was nearly as enthralling or rangy as Boseman. The entire ensemble is very good, with the piano playing Turman as my favorite supporting performance. The script is fine, and it does set the atmosphere and rapport among the players well, but largely repeats the same series of interactions with only a couple unique scenes. The direction was my biggest problem with the film - not that it was incompetent, but that no depth was added to the film beyond what's present in the dialogue. Several of the music scenes cut around haphazardly, and the blocking was extremely uncreative, with wide shots that hone in on a character's face with no depth to the shots or visual meaning. The dialogue captures the struggles of black people fighting their way through a white person's world, but none of the editing or blocking during this dialogue added to it any more than reading the words on a page. I will give credit for one scene which was extremely thematically interesting: the door. Boseman is convinced that the door is new, and we see him playing with it and trying to open it throughout the film. As he is dejected late in the movie, he pushes on the door, it won't budge, and eventually it opens, only for him to find that it leads to an empty, walled in space. Just for this metaphor alone I almost gave the film an 8 - this perfectly symbolizes Boseman's struggle in feeling like he has no hope or door to success, seems like he finds one, only for it to be blocked off all along. The ending makes some sense on a character level but I disliked the execution - it felt so absurd and unaware as to be implausible coming from Levee. Ma Rainey is definitely a good movie and Boseman is the definitive reason, but more compelling direction could have elevated this into an excellent one.",0,0,0,-1,1,1,-1
Ma Rainey's Black Bottom,"Rumors of this film's performances have been circulating for some time. I can see why. The entire cast is fantastic, and Davis and Boseman are especially electric. Like any film adapted from a play, this story focuses heavily on dialogue - not set pieces or cinematography. No reimagining here. There's just a studio, a cast of characters, and rising tensions. But the script in this case is from August Wilson, and the actors truly bring it to life. This 100 minutes absolutely flew by. The movie made me miss seeing plays live and in-person...and it made me miss Chadwick Boseman, as well. It is a fitting tribute, to him, to Wilson, and to the real Ma Rainey herself.",0,1,0,0,-999,1,0
Ma Rainey's Black Bottom,"I didn't expect to enjoy Ma Rainey's Black Bottom as much as I did. In fact, it's currently my favourite film of 2020, and I've seen a lot of flicks this year.Chadwick Boseman gives the best performance of his career, and I'm not just saying that because he tragically passed away earlier this year. He was phenomenal, and easily a top five performance of the entire year. This man would have probably had an Oscar on his mantle within the next five years, and it's such a shame that he'll never get that now.Viola Davis was also fantastic. Everyone else in the cast turned in near-perfect performances, but it was really Boseman and Davis' film.It's fair to say that Ma Rainey's Black Bottom is much more of a character study and acting showcase than heavy on plot, but that didn't bother me in the slightest.Almost all of the film takes place on the stage or in the basement where the band practices, and I'm a big fan of films with single-locations. 12 Angry Men is probably the best example of this, but I also loved The Boys in the Band that came out earlier this year.Aside from the incredible acting, the screenplay is what really made me fall in love with this film. The dialogue is crisp, the character backstories are interesting, and I was completely invested in everything that was happening.There were five minutes that dragged a little in the middle of the film, but that's my only criticism with it. I was also a little surprised by the turn that happened at the very end of the film, but it wasn't really a negative. I'm not sure how I feel about it, so I'll probably rewatch the film soon to get a more concrete opinion on the ending. However, for now, I'll say that it worked because of all the set-up and backstory that Levee was given.I had never heard of the play that this was based on before now, but watching the film made me curious to do some research.Aside from a tiny section in the middle of the film, Ma Rainey's Black Bottom was mesmerising. It features powerhouse performances and one of the best screenplays of the year, which means that I absolutely have to recommend it.SCORE: 97%",1,1,0,0,1,1,0
Ma Rainey's Black Bottom,"This film caught my eye for many reasons, the ensemble cast of well known actors... produced by Denzel Washington and it being on Barack Obama's list of favorite movies and TV shows of 2020. The unexpected death of Chadwick Boseman who plays Levee in this film is a strong reason as it's his last film, he's a great actor like everyone else in this fine motion picture but it's one of his best performances, the critics said that and I'll have to agree that it was extraordinary.Ma Rainey's Black Bottom is based on a play and it plays out similar to Denzel Washington's Fences, so a really good drama, this film is about music as much as it is about drama and tension.
The legendary Mother of the Blues or Ma Rainey as her real name were, she's portrayed brilliantly by Viola Davis whilst Colman Domingo portrays a character called Cutler. Those two and of course Levee is the main characters, and all three gave amazing performances. Great cast.This film is similar to Fences as it's very dialogue driven, it has a faster pace than Denzel's film but it's similar in terms of production. The writing is perfect, the dialogue is superb and so the direction was also fantastic. Dialogue heavy movies isn't for everyone as they're often slow paced and character driven, the film is like theatre but up on the big screen. But movies like this often gives the actors extra chance to shine and that's what they do here, delivering lines beautifully and the monologues even better.Let's take a second to talk about the costume and hair department and all the talented people who worked on this film, everyone should be praised for their terrific work. It's a great film, one of the best I've seen this year of the movies that arrived in 2020. Barack Obama was right putting Ma Rainey's Black Bottom on his list, it's now on mine. Is it a movie I'll watch again? I don't know, possibly for the performances. Fantastic is a word I'll use to describe them.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1
Ma Rainey's Black Bottom,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)Usually, at the end of each year, I prepare my watchlist for the next twelve months. Obviously, no matter how many movies I add to the list, I know dozens of more films will be announced and released throughout the year. Ma Rainey's Black Bottom is one of them. I didn't know a thing about this flick, but it received the always interesting awards buzz, which turned it into a mandatory viewing before Christmas comes around. I went in knowing only one thing: this is Chadwick Boseman's (Black Panther, Avengers: Infinity War) last appearance after he passed away a few months ago. I really didn't know what to expect from this Netflix's Oscar-bait, but I was afraid that Boseman's nomination chances were high only due to what happened in real-life instead of him truly deserving that recognition...Well, I can safely and confidently write that Boseman delivers his career-best interpretation, and it wouldn't be unfair for him to get tons of awards posthumously. From an impeccable accent to his mind-blowing emotional range, passing through long monologues and uncut takes effortlessly, Boseman is the strong glue that holds everything in place. What seems, at first, a hangout movie (narrative without a clear central plot) turns into a character-study. Levee wants to follow his dreams, do what he does best in his own conditions and with his personal interpretation of music and soul. Boseman incorporates this character seamlessly, delivering a memorable performance that I hope will be remembered as a worthy Oscar winner if this situation ends up becoming true.Even though Boseman is the actor that shines brighter, every single one is absolutely outstanding. Viola Davis shares the main spotlight with him by representing the (real-life) iconic blues singer, Ma Rainey. To be completely honest, I didn't know who this singer was nor how she impacted soul music. Ruben Santiago-Hudson first feature-film screenplay is packed with entertaining banter between the band members but also with heartfelt, gut-wrenching, shocking monologues that deeply explore a character's past and personality. Davis tackles every single line of hers with brutal intensity and extreme expressiveness, constantly offering 200% of her energy.George C. Wolfe (first movie I see of his) demonstrates exquisite control of every scene and elevates the dialogue-driven narrative with an exceptional balance of tone and pacing. Tobias A. Schliessler's camera lingers beautifully on the actors, allowing them to showcase their abilities but also helping the viewer feel enthralled with their words by not creating any unnecessary technical distractions. Andrew Mondshein's editing also contributes a lot to the smooth pace that the film warrants, but it's Branford Marsalis' inspiring, soulful score that will probably encourage most viewers to enjoy the overall movie. Technically, I can't point out a single issue. Huge praise for the appropriate costume design and overall production value.Honestly, I don't really have much to complain about. It might not have a conventional main plot, but it's also far from being a ""nothing"" film. As I mentioned above, the banter between Toledo (Glynn Turman), Cutler (Colman Domingo), Slow Drag (Michael Potts), and Levee is incredibly amusing and genuinely hilarious at times. However, it goes down through an unexpected dark path, ultimately culminating in a surprising finale. Every character has their own monologue containing details of their personal lives, which I regularly felt interested in, despite the repetitive structure. It works as a character-study, mainly about Levee and Ma Rainey, but also as a fun, good time that goes by quicker than I initially anticipated.In the end, Ma Rainey's Black Bottom is going to be forever remembered as Chadwick Boseman's last role. Call it destiny, but it's, undoubtedly, Boseman's career-best performance. Hopefully, if he ends up winning an Oscar posthumously, this won't be identified as a charity recognition but as a worthy, fair, triumphant celebration of his inspiring, impactful talent on-screen. Viola Davis also shines in this uncommon narrative, which focuses its spotlight on long, uncut, engaging monologues, captivating dialogues, and entertaining banter, all handled effortlessly by every actor involved. Despite the absence of a clear central plot, it's closer to a character-study than to a hangout flick. George C. Wolfe and Ruben Santiago-Hudson deliver a technically flawless movie with an excellent balance of its tone and pacing but also boasting impeccable cinematography, seamless editing, and a soulful score. It's definitely a serious contender for the awards season, so make sure to save ninety minutes of your Christmas season to enjoy this simple yet surprising story.Rating: A-",1,1,1,1,-999,1,1
Ma Rainey's Black Bottom,"This is one of those movies that has a great trailer but in my opinion apart from some wonderful performances by Viola Davis as Ma Rainey and The Late Chadwick Boseman as Levee a musician in her band the script based on a play by August Wilson disappointed me.
I felt I'd seen this type of story before anc done much better in films like ""Lady Sings the Blues "" 1972 and Lady Day at Emerson's Bar and Grill or What's Love Got To Do With It?
Perhaps because this film is just a tiny excerpt of Ma Rainey's life I would have liked to know more about the character as I'd never heard of her before?
I read after the movie that Gertrude ""Ma"" Rainey (born Gertrude Pridgett, April 26, 1886 - December 22, 1939 was one of the earliest African-American professional blues singers and one of the first generation of blues singers to record.
The ""Mother of the Blues"", and that she bridged earlier vaudeville and the authentic expression of southern blues, influencing a generation of blues singers.
When I first saw the trailer I thought it was based on the more famous Blues Singer Bessie Smith who sang and performed about the same time and had a very dramatic story and experienced terrible treatment and discrimination.
It may be that Ma Rainey seems static because it feels like a film of a play and after reading that George C Wolfe is acknowledged as an acclaimed Broadway director producer so that could explain why it seemed like a play to me.
I felt similar about the film version of August Wilson's ""Fences ""2016 which I enjoyed more than Ma Rainey.
Dubbed the Mother of the Blues, Ma Rainey is boldly unapologetic, which Viola Davis embraced when crafting her performance. ... Davis sings one song, ""Those Dogs Of Mine,"" herself (soul singer Maxayn Lewis isbehind the rest of the vocals).
Set in Chicago, 1927 during a recording session. Tensions rise between Ma Rainey, her ambitious horn player and the white management determined to control the uncontrollable ""Mother of the Blues"". Based on Pulitzer Prize winner August Wilson's play.
There may be a few acting Academy Awards handed out for acting ,costumes or makeup but for me the film itself just didn't grab me as great .
Viola Davis looks amazing padded up and made up to look much older and matronly thanks to a great make up artist and is a brilliant actress .
The sets and costumes are impressive I wanted to like this film I love The Blues singers of that era but the script just didn't impress me .
The movie is appropriately dedicated to Chadwick Boseman who tragically died at 43 years old about a year after filming completed.",-1,0,-1,0,1,1,-1
Ma Rainey's Black Bottom,"Dialogue heavy, raw and powerful in every way; ""Ma Rainey's Black Bottom"" is everything you'd expect from an August Wilson adaption with scorching performances from Viola Davis and the late, great Chadwick Boseman.In this drama set in 1927 Chicago, tensions rise between Ma Rainey, her horn player and the white management determined to control the uncontrollable ""Mother of the Blues"". Based on the play by August Wilson.The magic of ""Ma Rainey's Black Bottom"" is how everything comes together. The characters, the music, the relevancy and the beauty of it. In a little over 90-minutes, so much happens and so much is said, you may need to view it a second time. The dialogue is key here; every word uttered by the characters are educational and deep. The fact that Ma Rainey was crowned ""Mother of the Blues"" and was making the record label tons of money and they still had her and her band record in some dingy prison cell-like studio is appalling. This film is so important but also so sad. The performances are some of the best of the year; Viola Davis is magnificent and majestic. Glynn Turman and Colman Domingo are terrific and vibrant in their respective supporting roles. Of course without Chadwick Boseman this film wouldn't be the same. Boseman carries this drama with so much fire, so much talent it's hard to turn away from the screen. He was incredible force and it really shows here in his final screen role. Between ""Ma Rainey's Black Bottom"" and ""Da Five Bloods"", Boseman is deserving of his Oscar praise and I think his family will take one home posthumously for one of those films. A brilliant and vibrant drama that is among the best films of 2020.Follow @snobmedia for all reviews!",1,1,0,1,1,1,-999
The Expanse,"When I found ""The Expanse"" it was already at the end of the first season, and I had not heard about it prior to finding it. Nor did I know that the series was based on books, which apparently are driven more by the characters, as to what is seen in the series.Regardless, I sat down to watch ""The Expanse"", although my sci-fi needs are usually met by ""Star Wars"" and ""Star Wars"" alone. So I was more than genuinely and positively surprised with how exciting, thrilling and entertaining this series turned out to be.The story in ""The Expanse"" was interesting and compelling. It was a story that quickly found root in the audience and stayed fresh and interesting throughout the entire first season. And I have been told that it kicks up a notch in season two. Which is impressive, because I was really impressed with the first season.And they had cast some really great names for the various roles, and I was more than impressed with Thomas Jane in the lead role, because he really carried the character quite well. Just took a while to get accustomed to his hair.""The Expanse"" is heavily laden with special effects, and the special effects team really pull off the effects quite nicely, which really adds a great flavor to the series. And as a sci-fi series, then having believable and convincing CGI effects is a make-or-break deal.The entire series is taking place in our own solar system, which is interesting, because it is easier to relate to it, since it is so close to home - relatively speaking, of course. And the entire atmosphere is good and makes for a vibrant universe.And it is a great way that the different story lines are interwoven and connect to each other in different ways. There are times when you think ""what is going on here?"" only to find enlightenment at a later point in the episode or a later episode. And that way of connecting everything together is great.I am definitely looking forward to starting on season 2 and believe that this is a series that I will follow to the very end. It is a great sci-fi show, and if you are not already familiar with this series, and you like sci-fi, then get into gear and start watching.",1,1,1,1,0,1,1
The Expanse,"(Updated after Season 4).Hundreds of years into the future, Earth has colonised Mars but Mars is now independent, and the two planets are in a constant state of distrust and unease. Caught between these two are the people of the asteroid belt and outer planets. James Holden, the executive officer of a freighter witnesses his ship, being destroyed by what appears to be a Martian warship. This heightens the tensions between Earth and Mars and sets Holden and his remaining crew on a quest across the galaxy to find the truth behind the incident. Meanwhile, on Ceres in the Asteroid Belt, a police detective is searching for the daughter of the wealthiest man in the galaxy. These are all parts of a conspiracy that that will threaten life in the Solar System.Brilliant. I am not a huge fan of sci fi series (Firefly was the notable exception): they tend to rely too much on gimmicky inventions and faux science, at the expense of plot. The Expanse is different: the science and future history are incredibly believable. I'm no physicist but I found it difficult to fault the physics and technology involved. More than that, the futuristic nature of the series provides the background, not the story, so the series does not rely on it.What the series does rely is plot, and it is a great one. Starts out pretty slowly, so doesn't immediately pull you in, but after three episodes or so it is off to the races. The seemingly-parallel stories start to intersect, things start to make more sense (though, thankfully, not so much that the mystery disappears), the characters become more interesting and the action ramps up.The story is then intelligently developed over the following seasons. Despite the many twists and turns, the plot remains solid, with no twists for twists sake and everything fits together very well. Even when one mystery is solved, another emerges to take its place, without feeling gratuitous.Quite grittily told too: no characters are unexpendable, making the plot quite unpredictable.Superb special effects and action scenes. The CGI is absolutely seamless and realistic, without being too ostentatious. Like the science, the CGI is the medium, not the message.Performances are where the series does feel a bit lacking. The main characters - the crew of the Rocinante - are reasonably well played, though there are no stand-out performances. Some of the lesser characters are quite badly played though, with the worst culprits being Shohreh Aghdashloo as Chrisjen Avasarala and Shawn Doyle as Sadavir Enright. Any scene they were in made me cringe, with Aghdashloo being particularly irritating. She wasn't helped by her character being pretty badly drawn, with the worst dialogue and most grating mannerisms of any character in the series. The two factors - the character and her performance - just compounded each other.The lack of character depth is a general weakness in the show too. The series is about the intrigue and action, much more than the people and their relationships, making character engagement less than complete (unlike Firefly, which was highly engaging because of the characters and their interactions).This is a minor flaw though, as the plot and its roller-coaster momentum propel the show.Superb.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The only saving grace is that the show DOES have some amazing special effects for a SYFY show. Way better than anything I've seen coming from them. In fact, it has some better special effects that a number of theatre movies I've seen.If Battlestar Galactica had these quality effects, it would still be on.

The Expanse,"The Syfy Channel has become more ambitious, lately, in the creation of sci-fi dramas. As viewers, we are the beneficiaries of their efforts, though some offerings could have been stronger.The first four episodes of ""The Expanse"" have proved its strength, with impressive sets, an engaging story, and solid special effects.In a 23rd century solar system, Earth is governed by the U.N., and on the decline. Mars is an independent military power, populated by dreamers and achievers intent on building a future. The asteroid belt supplies Earth and Mars with its rich mining resources, excavated and transported by those who perform dirty, dangerous jobs and feel they are exploited.Tensions are high. The threat of war is a constant. Each faction is on alert and watchful of its interests. On Ceres, the main settlement in the Belt, Detective Joe Miller (Thomas Jane) tries to keep instigators in line. He is a return to the noir enforcer. As he says, there are ""No laws on Ceres, just cops."" Tasked with an ""off book"" case, he is also gathering clues regarding the disappearance of a wealthy family's daughter.Meanwhile, the ice trawler Canterbury is diverted from its standard trip delivering cargo to Ceres. Its second officer, Jim Holden (Steven Strait), finds himself an integral part of the dangerous drama that follows.The show tracks both the lives of individuals and the big-picture happenings of the entire inter-world system.The early episodes do a good job of giving ""the lay of the land"" and profiling the major players. There are parallels to situations in the 21st century and scenarios that show the results of actions from this era, making the story more relevant and believable. The creators of the show promise that the series is ""about a transformative moment in human history"", so viewers can expect big things.Update 2/10/16: The first season has ended and I am happy with my grade of ""8"" for this show. I will say that my interest in the show grew in the last three episodes, when the disparate stories started to converge. One part is a space noir, one part is a cold space drama, and the third part is a political intrigue. By season's end, the viewer begins to see the larger arc that binds the three sections together.

The Expanse,"This Expanse series continues, like most other made for TV syfy productions, to fail basic middle school science. And it's hard to fail classes these days.

The Expanse,"And, in true Syfy form, of course they cancelled the series right in the middle of an important season apparently - If I understand the trivia section correctly. Thankfully Amazon took over and did a fourth season, maybe they will do more- that would be great.The most impressive actress in this show has been Shohreh Aghdashloo, who I first saw in X-Men 3. She always had little cameos in these films, but in this show, gee character drives a lot of the motivation and direction of the series. She does not really participate in the final season 3 episodes, not being trapped in the ring with everyone else, but her fingerprints are all over the politics that brought Earthers, Martians and Belters to a common table.This show reminds me of Larry Niven's ""Belter"" stories, and his known space series of books which goes all the way back to stories of Gil ""The Arm"", who was a Belter who moved to earth and became a police officer for the ""amalgamation of regional militia"" aka ARM, Beowulf Schaeffer who had a relationship with puppeteers and flew a couple of their different general products ships, one of them into the center of the galaxy discovering that it had exploded. another to an antimatter planet (and apparently GP Hulls cannot tolerate Anti-Matter)- and his possible son Louis Wu via his GF Tanya Wu (See the book ""Flatlander"" by Niven) aka ""Luweewu"" who flew to the Ringworld and was last seen hanging out with the former ""Hindmost"" of the Puppeteers after saving the Ringworld from destruction, Protectors (3rd stage humans who become too smart and only are interested in preserving their own bloodline, so they always fight each other, killing everybody else in the process) and an ARM navy that was stupidly fighting each other with antimatter weapons around the orbit of the Ringworld.But that is a huge universe created by a different author. This series of books and this show based upon those books, is restricted to our own solar system and the governments of Earth Mars and the Belt which does not really have a government.And so we see a lot of things that also exist in the Larry Niven Known Space universe: including the mining of asteroids in the belt, or minerals and water, and the idea of Terra-forming Mars. Even the ""Belter Haircuts"" and tattoos of Niven's work are here. Ships landing on earth use compressed air like they do in Niven's book ""World of Ptavvs"", rather than using rockets. In the belt, the ""Epstein Drive"" is used rather than Niven's Fusion Drives. But there is still a lot of material borrowed from Niven's known space. But that's not a bad thing.But one thing that is different about this universe is that so far, The descendants of mankind who have populated the solar system have not really encountered any possible alien life-until now.And the concept of life that is thought up in this show is very different- in fact in 2 1/2 seasons, I still can't figure out the nature of that life form.Thomas Jane is a Ceres cop, who is given the job of locating the daughter of a rich industrialist, Julie Mao (Father named Jules)- she is the centerpiece of the series for the first season and a half or so- even though she doesn't really appear or interact with any of the other characters other than in flashback sequences. In fact the entire first season is a search for her among other things. Thomas Jane is Joe Miller, the Ceres Cop, and has made finding her his obsession because maybe it's the one good thing that he's ever done and he becomes so absorbed in finding her it causes problems with some of the other people in this series.Also there are quite a bit of politics in the show, sometimes directly relating to our own politics of this day, and a lot of this is extremely relevant.We also have four people, Jim Holden, Alex Kamal, Naomi Nagata and Amos Burton, who through no fault of their own become the crew of a ship that they have named The Rocinante, they were all crew members a board a ship called The Canterbury, sent out on a rescue operation which also just so happened to involve Julie Mao...And they become an important part of the story as well eventually Joe Miller gravitates toward them - and so does every other problem in the solar system it would seem.Later, other crew members include a gunnery sergeant from Mars and a botanist from Ganymede- and maybe even his daughter, which she lost track of during a catastrophe on Ganymede.I'm not sure if this show is going to continue into a fifth season, but if they can make a fifth season as interesting as the first three that I have seen, then I will definitely watch it.There are a lot of actors that I don't recognize except for Tom Jane who was The Punisher, he is a little older now but he still looks great even with the beard, and Florence Faivre who was a very nasty piece of work Kree soldier in Agents of SHIELD, she's the one that had those two floating balls that killed people, eventually killed off by Quake in a most satisfying way...Sometimes there are stupid decisions and arguments in some of these episodes which make me want to strangle the characters when I see it, but so far I like how things have worked out tween them, the crew of the ""Roci"" are friends, and this show depicts a very realistic friendship between these people. The small conflicts between each of them at the beginning of the show shows how people from all kinds of backgrounds could become good friends under the right circumstances.There are all kinds of other things going on, on earth, on Mars, On Ships various places in the solar system, and especially at a base called Tycho where the Mormons are building an incredibly huge ship called The Navoo... that is just another problem.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
The Expanse,"So many science fiction series fail because they can not breach the gap between reality as it is and reality as it could be.The Expanse succeeds in large part because its very believable. There's a real world on offer, with a developed and plausible political and social structure. Intrigue, power games, corruption, inequality and the fight for resources. All the things we see everyday populate this world. People don't really change.Alongside the human drama sit some rather well thought out technological developments which in turn influence the evolution/devolution of humanity. Some humans, for example, live off world in artificial environments. The off worlders are sustained by technology but, at the same time, also constrained by it. They have evolved to suit low gravity environments and can no longer live on the planet their ancestors left to work in space.Its the attention to detail and consideration of where existing and fledgling technologies can lead and the key social and political implications of these technological changes that makes this series work.Is there a downside? I'd say the presentation of future earth is overly optimistic. Given the current degree of pollution and environmental damage presenting a relatively pristine Earth with only a hint of a raised sea level, is, to say the least, laughable. I'd be surprised too to see the United Nations still in business, by this time. Its already showing what a divisive failure it is, I can not imagine it would last this long.If you can look beyond this series minor shortcomings, in most respects, this is still an above average science fiction drama that's worth your time. Eight out of ten from me.",1,1,0,1,0,0,0

The Expanse,"Some of the other reviews compare this series to Game of Thrones in the sense of a political dimension. That's a sense I got too while trying to draw together in my mind all the different plot lines. This is a terrific series. I grew up reading science fiction through the 1960s and 1970s and this tale is very much the type of imagining of those early paperbacks. The scenery and special effects, star-ships and space stations is mind glowingly good. This television show has no trouble rivaling movies and as such represents something of a breakthrough. It doesn't suffer from the same spaceships and recreation rooms being used repeatedly as did Battlestar Galactica. Its scale is a little reminisce of Total Recall (the new movie as opposed to the old) . It has some of the detective quality of the first series of Extant, and indeed, features an actual detective not unlike the hero of Blade Runner, in fact, in some parts, a close comparison could be drawn to that movie as well. The detective is by far the world's most interesting character, and the show should be congratulated for creating a character, and a case, so interesting. There is also an Earth politician (Mars has politicians in this tale as well) that is also deeply imagined. It really is fantastic space drama. Breathtaking scope and a truly original yet utterly believable story-line. This could well be the world of tomorrow, I can't wait for the sequel.",1,1,1,0,0,1,1
The Expanse,"So the first watchthru of this show I didn't review it at all. 2nd Watchthru we'll see how it goes. I know I did love the first 2 seasons!!!Season 1The first 2 episodes, fantastic, then a good 3rd, ep4 the bridge escape through a hail of fire was very lame, they all should have died right there. Some of the later episodes, not perfect, but all in all a good season. Amazing world created here. Nothing at all wrapped up at the end of the season. So there's a lot left for a second season! 8/10Season 2This season picks up strong where season 1 left off as the crew follows the Protomolecule and tries to stop the war between Earth and Mars from happening. It really peaks at Episode 5. And after that the series sputters a bit. More and more illogical decisions and just blind luck that doesn't result in certain death and really certain death for everyone involved on both planets. And really the last 3 or 4 episodes were just really average or not good. Hopefully Season 3 can get stronger and breathe some new life into the story. Season 2 ends with a 7/10Season 3The story does really pick up again especially toward the end of the season where the Protomolecule which is now 'The Ring' becomes a new major force in the Universe. Great performances by David Straithairn and other actors we know and love such as Elizabeth Mitchell, Chris Owens, and a return appearance by Thomas Jane add to the mix. Another solid season. 8/10Season 4Straithairn and T. Jane return in limited roles as Holden and team deal with the fallout from the 'Ring' opening up 1300 new possible life supporting worlds. The Belters and the Inners continue their conflicts and disagreements. Thank you David Straithairn for being a part of this amazing show. 8/10",1,0,0,1,0,0,0
The Expanse,"Since Gravity landed on cinema screen a few years back, there's an increased interest on futuristic theme. However, television series of such kind hasn't had much improvement even though there are some niche shows like Killjoy or Dark Matter. The Expanse is without a doubt the most ambitious project from Syfy in a long time. Its graphical prowess and meticulous design is light year beyond others, and with great cast of multifaceted characters, this is primed to be a modern marvel.It's evident from the first five minutes that the visual is the caliber of high tier cinema or video game. Many scenes offer incredibly detailed vistas while the view of interstellar bodies is presented with high clarity. The interior also oozes sophisticated design, although some ar eas like the slums are shown as rugged settlement than the green lust housings of more elite inhabitants. This is presentation level not seen in Syfy series for a very long time.Story follows a futuristic world where three races live in less than perfect harmony. Earth and Mars have made progress on prosperity and military, respectively. Meanwhile there are Belters, who are born and work in asteroids, making their bodies different in more deformed kind of way. They are tall and with much less endurance than ordinary humans.This sets up a great political as well as social undertone. The leads are people with grey morale, Holden (Steven Strait) is the first mate of a cargo ship who has more compassion than he's willing to show, meanwhile Miller (Patrick Jane) is a corrupt detective with a sense of justice, albeit misguided. Other supporting characters have enough memorable traits without being dressed too outlandishly,.Their selfishness might be a product of judgmental nature, although they are more engaging in this way since the world is not kind. There are many subplots or terrorism and social prejudice that can be delve further in as a refined allegory of future issues. It's a good hook since the series can slowly introduce other parties while establishing what seems to be a very ambitious universe, even providing an angle of mystery along the way.With impeccable visual and engaging characters under its belt, The Expanse marks a revived quality on sci-fi from its stasis nature.",1,1,1,1,0,0,1

She sounds as if she has a 5 pack a day cigarette smoking habit. It is well cast, but the writers have a very thin plot. They should have kept it more single purposes.

The Expanse,"I hear the books are great, but the show has some challenges.

They won't be won over by the incredible cinematography or big story themes.I think part of the problem is the amount of time spent with Thomas Jane's (the detective) storyline - it's just too drawn out. Maybe it flows better in written / book form, but here just drags on and on. Jane is a good actor, but his low-key style does better when playing against high-energy actors.On the other hand, the developments of the space crew are tense, well-paced and immersive --- this is the strength of the show.

Third season starting some slowdown particularly in the last few episodes but nothing too bad. Season 4 however is perhaps the slower and dissociated one. Some political and crime stories matter very little compared with the Rocinante and their crew adventures; but still after chapter 4 things become more interesting and tense.
The Expanse has been able to get interesting secondary characters integrated into the main action.

The Expanse,"Too boring to watch.
I like new sci fi shows, tho most disappoint. I start out with high hopes.
this got renewed, along with Carnival Row Prime original - both so so boring and awful. I kind of can understand why someone would watch- but it's a very low bar. is everyone under 10.
I think as I've gotten older, I won't sit thru things I did in the past, than, bec of general boredom, and a higher tolerance for mediocrity. Not that my taste has improved. I just think my time is too valuable- even if I am multitasking at the same time.
but these 2 just get me lost, as my mind goes numb; and I can't even follow the plot any more. and there is never a time I could sit thru either of these.
Brilliance in TV and movies is at a premium. Sci Fi is hard to do well. But can't they come up with something mediocre, that is a least watchable with some entertainment value. But than I find the subsequent Star Treks (after the original series), and Battleship Galactica really boring-
No, I don't think there are an infinite developed planets and advanced species; a thinking functioning Animal like a neanderthal pre-cave man is highly developed as a living organism. compared to dirt, single cell, and insects. The speculation that there are infinite sentient life forms possilbe- in all this vaseness is a romantic theory. Thus we have a space detective, roaming the cosmos like it's the wild west prairie.
This is the fantasy that leads us to spend $Billions on flights to the moon and space stations. why do we need to go to Mars a dead (they may have some insect or single organism life) maybe- that gave us such great innovations as Tang (powdered orange juice). Just think what we could do to improve the Earth and ppl's lives. and with all this time and money can't we come up with something better.

The Expanse,"Seasons 1-3 are excellent; however, season 4 is quite disappointing. After binge-watching 1-3, I've noticed a marked difference with S4. The show is now made by Amazon, and the overall production is definitely cheaper. What's annoying me is that the casting has gone down the route of hiring 'good looking people' who aren't that great at acting. What made S1-3 good is that they cast normal-looking people who could act. That makes a big difference to the overall tone of the show. There was a grittiness and realness to the first three seasons, but S4 just looks 'nice and clean'. Good looking Belters dressed in 'nice', 'dirty looking clothes'. It reminds me of high brow actors trying (and failing) to play working-class characters. The high-quality writing has also slipped. (They've probably hired cheaper writers). Some of the dialogue has become a bit wooden, and of course, there's now the old classic drug-dealing trope in it. Yawn. The Miller character has become quite cliched and overall; I'm just not feeling it for season 4. To me, S4 has cheaper production, weaker casting, weaker actors, poorer writing and dialogue. That's a shame. Seasons 1-3 I rate as 9.5 whereas season 4 I rate a lowly 6. Overall, the show is an 8/10 for me.",0,-1,0,0,0,-1,0
His Dark Materials,"Review of Series One:The first series of HIS DARK MATERIALS is a more true-to-the-novel adaptation of Philip Pullman's NORTHERN LIGHTS than the Hollywood flick THE GOLDEN COMPASS. Over eight episodes, Lyra's story plays out with a particular effort to bring all of the remarkable visuals and vistas to life, thanks in part to the BBC's collaboration with American producers. It's not a perfect story, lacking something in the characterisation - which feels more hollow than on the page - and in the quality of the performances, particularly the central one which I found extremely bland. However, the calibre of the CGI effects is very good and the story moves at a strong place, shining with some good suspense sequences such as the cat-and-mouse antics in Ruth Wilson's apartment.

I guess the high rating of this series comes right from Pullman's fans. To me, who have not read the book, the first season of ""His Dark Materials"" wasn't boring. I enjoyed the visual appeal of the series, though it doesn't come anywhere close to ""Game of Thrones"" I just finished a few days e and tago, the interesting characters and the action, but to ask me what it's about - honestly, I have no idea. The first season raises countless questions and gives little to no answers. Everything is vague, confusing and without much sense. If they wanted it to be a mystery that unfolds in the end, the end that is coming in a few seasons, they should have given us at least some hints and cliffhangers that would motivate us to wait for the next season. It may be just me, but even though the series is within my favorite genre, I'm not at all interested in waiting for the continuation.

His Dark Materials,"So glad they made this into a TV adaptation, otherwise I'd have to actually read these books!I mostly watched this out of curiosity because I was that generation of British children who had this pushed down my throat from all sides but couldn't stick with it because it is just not compellingly written regardless of how nuanced it supposedly is.The world building is simple and doesn't make the mistake the movie made by shoving in a trilogy's worth of world building at the expense of story telling, though I would still say the movie is better overall.The world they're in looks cool though. They've gone for this darkish color palette while they're in the city but the arctic landscape is immersive and captivating as well. The design of this world, where we get a sort of technologically futuristic world but with a roaring twenties/art deco aesthetic is very refreshing and works enchantingly. I wish I knew more about who these ""Gyptians"" are (are they meant to be Romani?, who are they!?).The story has similar issues that I remember from the book. It doesn't quite understand the difference between being intriguing and just being confusingly esoteric about its inner workings. The story threads regarding clerical corruption are pretty dry and bureaucratic and our main plot isn't too much better.I always found it jarring and tiresome how they seem to begin with this discourse on other worlds and the tediously names ""dust"" (I know the simplicity is the point but still) only to then veer into a seemingly unrelated story about kidnapped children. It takes them way too long to get going with this and there are way too many soap opera style confrontations and reveals along the way.But finally they get to the arctic and there the fun really begins. There is this cool guy with a Hare companion. Why wasn't this who thing about him? Oh on that notem Lyra is a much better character than in the book. In the book she was utterly forgettable, but her she has a lot more personality. Shame it's kind of an obnoxious personality. I guess it 's going to be some kind of character arc but until she gets humbled by something you just have to put up with her. She is admittedly played quite adorably and the director of this show has a strange obsession with showing her in the bath.The sixth episode is by far the best since we get to where we want to be and find ourselves at a material and emotional climax. And then we find we have two episodes to go...the entire seventh episode feels pretty anti-climactic because of this. The final episode might have been devastating if I'd had any emotional investment in any of these characters.Maybe I'm missing something, but any subtext here has kind of alluded me. It annoys me how Lyra has this ""chosen one"" role in the story but then again there were written in the '90s. The whole truth watch...I'm just not sure what to make of it. Just seems like a cheat code by Pullman so he doesn't have to think of how they came up with the plan or found out what conveniences the plot for them to know.Intelligently, they introduce the series' deuteragonist. He didn't appear until second book. This strikes me as a much more logical narrative structure and is so much more efficient.In conclusion, this far from ideal but it's enjoyable viewing when you have your dinner on your lap. If parts don't work, it's still interesting to see what works and what doesn't so you can still get an enjoyment of sorts from it.I want to say something nice about the theme music too...I guess I already have.",1,0,0,0,1,0,0
His Dark Materials,"So tonight sees the start of the second season of His Dark Materials on BBC and I hadn't watched the first season all the way through, but the last few days I have done that and here is my review for the first season of the show. The premise of the season sees a young girl go on a journey to attempt to rescue children which have been stolen by a shady organisation.Main Character
Dafne Keen who made her name in Logan plays Lyra here and she is fantastic, this is such a talented young actress and one that could be around for a long time to come. Lyra is just a likeable person, but also a strong character that carries her own throughout the show. She isn't a damsel in distress or a young scared girl, she has a depth to her and intrigue that makes you want to learn more and care about her journey.Supporting Characters
Ruth Wilson plays Mrs Coulter here and she is really good, she is better then your average antagonist and actually has some real depth to her. She has a really interesting dynamic with Lyra and her motivations and aspirations are something different and she is a good character. Now if like me you were excited to see James McAvoy as Lord Asriel then just calm down a bit, he is great here in this pretty small role, he is gone for most of the season but when he is on screen he is a great character but yeah he doesn't have too much time on the screen. Lin Manuel Miranda plays a role here and does a good job too though it is funny that I pretty much just saw Hamilton when I looked at him but he added plenty of life and energy to the show when it needed it. The rest of the cast all also do great jobs and the cast are the real highlight of the show.Story
The story is good, the show has to go through plenty of worldbuilding and does a really good job of it and creates a really interesting world for you to get invested in. Lyra's journey is a great watch and the different people she comes across add plenty to the story and there own interesting takes. But there is one element of the story I just really didn't like, I won't go into it much because it is a huge spoiler that I didn't know going into the show but it really took me out of the story and made me sigh every time it came onto the screen.Script
The script is really good, there is a great blend of humour and drama to make these fascinating characters and a more interesting narrative. It adds to the building of this world and these characters to make you care and get you invested into what you are watching.Style
The show looks amazing visually, it clearly has a huge budget and it shows, it looks brilliant. The CGI for the creatures is top notch and the action scenes and backgrounds look great too making this show feel more epic in nature and larger stakes then other shows. But this show does have a bit of a pacing issue and I am not sure how to explain it, as it does feel a bit slow but so much happens this season that maybe things aren't fully developed. I'm not sure the exact answer to that but I think that becomes an issue as the show progresses as it tries to focus on different character arcs.Overall
Overall, this is a great first season of a fantasy show. It has so much intrigue and excitement that it is worth a watch, hopefully the second season is just as good and hopefully even better.",1,1,0,0,0,1,1
His Dark Materials,"For the last 7 weeks, His Dark Materials second season has been on BBC One and now it has finished so here is my review. The premise of the season sees Lyra and Will come together to attempt to find an object to protect them both from evil forces.Main Character
Dafne Keen is back as Lyra and once again she is really good in the role. It is just really easy to root for her and want to see her succeed in her quest and I also think she has matured in the role and showing stronger acting ability. Amir Wilson plays Will and I must admit I didn't warm to him at first, whether that was the first season or this season but he bought me around. I really liked the dynamic between Lyra and Will as the season progressed and I actually believed they had a friendship and that it had been developed throughout the season.Supporting Characters
Ruth Wilson plays Mrs Coulter and again she is really good here, her character is well developed and unlike the first season I actually believed she cared about Lyra and despite her own personal goals that plays much heavier in this season which is a nice development here. Lin Manuel Miranda and Andrew Scott are the team-up we never knew we needed, for me they are the most entertaining part of the show and really do a great job in adding some fun tot this show while keeping with the depth. However, the rest of the cast didn't work for me, Simone Kirby's character annoyed the hell out of me, mainly because the part of the plot she was involved in and how it just takes away from the mystique that the show has built up. All the stuff to do with the witches and magisterium starts off alright but falls flat and flatters to deceive and feels like a waste of time.Story
The story had me pretty much shaking my head throughout and felt like a weaker element then in the previous season. Yes the relationships between Lyra and Will is well handled and Lin Manuel Miranda and Andrew Scott are a fun pairing but the way they finished these characters arcs this season really disappointed me. So much that it has me questioning whether I even want to bother with the next season. I would say there is more going on this season that isn't connected to Lyra and it just isn't particularly interesting and it makes some of the mistakes of last season while creating whole new ones.Script
The show does have some well written scenes in it for sure mainly between the main characters and that does a good job in making them pretty likeable and well done. But this show suffers from weak circumstantial writing, every show is guilty of it but I thought this show suffered with it more and it bogged down the show for me and made it harder for me to get on board.Style
The one thing this show has for it is that it looks fantastic, the world looks great and that continues this season as visually the show does stand out from others. Due to the pandemic this show had 7 episodes instead of 8 and there is not much they could have done about that but to me it did feel like there was parts of the show that was missing and underdeveloped which is a shame considering the world that is built through the two seasons.Overall
Overall, the second season is a step down in quality and only represents an average show. I think if you weren't convinced by the first season then this won't do much more for you and if they continue like this I do worry for this shows future.",0,1,0,0,-999,1,1

His Dark Materials,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)This review will be from someone who doesn't remember a single thing about The Golden Compass (2007), and who didn't read the books. This series wasn't marketed like Watchmen, which requires previous knowledge from the universe it is set in. Therefore, it should stand on its own... and it does, even if with a few struggles along the way, especially at the beginning. I won't spoil anything that the trailers didn't show, so don't worry.If there's one thing no one will complain about His Dark Materials debut season is its impeccable cast. Dafne Keen is a spot-on choice to interpret Lyra Belacqua. She has the innocence of such a young child, but also the determination and courage that the character needs her to show. She's definitely the one who has the responsibility to move the plot forward. Her journey is filled with obstacles, emotional conflicts, and tons of adventures elevated by the beautiful visual effects, which improve as the season approaches its ending. I loved her in Logan (2017), I love her here as well.James McAvoy is one of my favorite actors working today, and if the world was fair, he would have a couple of Oscar nominations already. He doesn't have that much screentime as Lord Asriel (marketing move from HBO, using an acclaimed actor to bring in audiences), but he is essential in the first episode, where a lot of exposition has to be given to the viewers. What could have been an overwhelming pilot episode concerning the amount of information to be transmitted, it turns out to be a pretty good introduction to some concepts and rules of this show. However, don't be fooled by my previous words: Lord Asriel is a crucial character this season, and he will continue to be one.The rest of the cast is terrific. Shout-out to Lin-Manuel Miranda (Lee Scoresby), who cracks a few well-earned (and necessary) jokes to lighten the sometimes too dramatic tone. Great voice work from everyone involved with the daemons. However, Ruth Wilson steals the spotlight from everyone, including McAvoy and Dafne, as Marisa Coulter. If she receives a nomination for her fantastic performance, I won't be surprised. Her eyes express so much, and her movements resemble the ones of her daemon in jaw-dropping fashion. Little details that some people might not even care about, but Ruth really commits 200% to her role.Obviously, this being an HBO series, the production level is very high. Surprisingly, the visual effects don't start that well. The first episodes are packed with noticeable green-screen, mainly in wide shots of some locations. However, from the fourth episode on, it's like someone else stepped in, and the CGI profoundly improved overall. The daemons are consistently great throughout the whole season, but there's a certain restraint in clearly showing them during those first chapters. Once Lyra gets deep in her journey, the different landscapes and sets look stunning, accompanied by excellent cinematography. Finally, the bears are, as expected, visually incredible.Lorne Balfe delivers a wonderful main theme, sure, but his score enriches the show in a way that I can't stop listening to it. It's mostly subtle, but when it needs to bring those emotional chills, it definitely carries the necessary epic chords and melodies. I've been a fan of his work lately, so congrats to him for yet another hit soundtrack.Unfortunately, I do have some issues with this season. The biggest one is related to a massive subplot that I can't reveal or dive into too much. What I can write is that it feels so separated from the main story that it feels like a totally different series with different characters. I know it's going to reach a point where it does become extremely important, but this season... it didn't even end with a massive plot point, twist or cliffhanger. It's so detached from Lyra's world and her mission that it unbalances the series' pacing.This last aspect is consequently very inconsistent. The season carries a slow pace that I genuinely enjoy when it helps develop its characters further. However, when it switches from the lead narrative to the before-mentioned side story, it's like adding an extra layer of ""slow"" to the already steady pace. It doesn't help with the entertainment value, and it doesn't efficiently expand the plot. I hope next season these two narratives can start converging in some way, something I expected before the debut season's finale.In addition to this, the visual effects were not really there during the first episodes. It takes until the fourth episode to get into a real adventure, which can make some people give up before that. I don't recommend doing it. It might be a slow start, but once the main story finds its rhythm, there's no stopping it. Each episode gets better than the previous, culminating in a shocking finale packed with some of the best moments of the entire season.All in all, His Dark Materials has the potential to become one of the biggest shows on HBO. If done right, it can really become the leader of the pack. It possesses a truly captivating and engaging story, filled with gorgeous visuals, even if these aren't that perfect during the first chapters. From the fabulous set design to Lorne Balfe's phenomenal score, all directors did a great job with Jack Thorne's writing. However, Thorne's attempt to balance the main narrative with a too distinct side story breaks the series momentum and keeps the pacing inconsistent. Fortunately, the outstanding cast lead by a great Dafne Keen and an even greater Ruth Wilson are able to carry the show to safe harbor. It's good so far, but I would wait until next season to find out if the alethiometer has the solution to this one's problems...",0,1,0,-1,1,1,1
The Wilds,"This may be a minority opinion but I found this series badly written with a poorly constructed, underlying reality. The story unfolds in a format similar to 13 REASONS where each episode is one girl's backstory. The plot is plodding. The ""research project"" is extremely unconvincing. The continuity is fractured. Basically, you not only have to suspend disbelief, but you also have to ignore any understanding of physical reality. I have no intention of watching them repeat this process with their male counterparts in a second season. I began watching with a willingness to give it a chance but ended up regretting the wasted time. I give the series a 4 (poor) out of 10 {Young Adult Drama}",-1,-999,-1,0,-999,-999,0

The Wilds,"If it weren't for the very good acting, the thrill, the filming in beautiful pristine surroundings and the superb background stories & characters development, the series would be an average one at best. But, with the mentioned, complemented with layers of suspense brought in by the environment and happenings factors on a ""teen"" scale, it was definitely engaging and a pleasure to watch through.(+-) Good and thought-out screenplay with superb characters development, but a little messy and unclear in regard to what led them there and how they were ""rescued"". (food for the next season?)(+) Very good acting by the girls. They gave the best of themselves with lots of believable chemistry. Especially loved Shelby (Mia Healey). She brought in to her character a crazy charismatic vibe, in a sort of a deep way. A personal achievement.(+-) The clarity in the girls diet in the twenty three days leaves a lot to be desired. Diet coke, scotch, vodka and boiled water!... The poor goat?!(-) Poor logic with regard to the cell phone having charge for over three weeks, the island ""spying"" technology, the camera angles and the observers' prowesses & capabilities.

The Wilds,"Yes this show is a lot like Lost: a group of people, stranded in an island, with a conspiracy lurking all around them. Flashbcks and Flashforwards are also here. But thankfully there are no supernatural element here, questions do not take whole seasons to be answered and you get to see the bad guys plan unfold.Pros:
The show is not just about the characters or the conspiracy, but about their psychology. Where they come from, why they act the way they act and so on. I find this very interestingDirection and plot and the actresses are all good.The survivors without acting too smart, they dont act too stupid either. Their interactions are interesting.Some things are justified well in the story.I like that the bad guys also struggle and we see their point of view and thoughts.Not all the girls are models, which adds to the realism. If anything, they have sunburn make up that makes them kind of ugly. They are quite diverse too. You got the christian girl, the athletic, the introvert etc. And it was bound to have a couple of lesbians in there, so it pretty much checks most of the trope boxes.Cons:
As it happens often, when a conspiracy gets explained, many things don't add up. They left many things to chance, like, why they left a working phone with the survivors? Or how they pick these girls if the girls or their parents decided to go on their own free will, seemingly without manipulation? Or how is the island a safe place if there is quicksand, sharks and other dangers?Too many coincidences or reused themes. Half the girls had someone die in their past, or were involved with an older guy or they come from troubled homes. You need to suspend your disbelief a lot to accept that ""it was part of the plan"" as all the girls were chosen for this.Just 5 people pulling this conspiracy off, is a stretch. Let alone having a whole island full of cameras.The bad guys end game feels shallow. One experiment doesnt prove anything and even if it did, it doesnt mean that all humanity will change its course. It's a biased experiment, and it doesn't really display the female potential in the creation of a matriarch world since they struggle and men are missing from the picture.",0,1,1,1,0,1,-1

The only character(s) I liked were Toni and Shelby because I liked their dialogue and I thought they were the strongest girls in the group. It didn't surprise me that they later on had a thing for each other. But overall, I was really bored with the plot (there wasn't really one), but I guess this show is kinda watchable.",0,-1,0,0,0,-1,0

Tiny Pretty Things,"I know when this type of show is cast, they have to cast professional dancers and so not everyone is going to be a great actor. However I think the dancers did a good job in this show. The only person I wasn't overly keen on was the actress who played Nevaeh. She could have been cast better. Also Lauren Holly was the wrong choice for the character of Monique Du Bois. For me, she didn't have the acting chops to pull this character off. Someone like Viola Davis bringing Annalise Keating vibes would have been perfect in this role.
Despite this I really liked the show. It's Riverdale and Pretty Little Liars meets Black Swan. It was a good storyline although it was very predictable. It wasn't difficult to guess who pushed Cassie and it was also easy to predict what happened right at the end as well.One thing I didn't like at all were the odd dream sequences that many of the characters had. There were too many and I felt the cheapened the show a bit. They started to become very annoying.All in all it's a good show with some solid performances and a very very good soundtrack. I'm looking forward to season 2.",1,0,0,0,1,1,0
Tiny Pretty Things,"I am not the type to judge shows harshly. I don't have a big whiteboard in my living room to connect all the plot points and get upset for weeks when a show doesn't connect a plot by the end of a season. I dont get upset if a pet or a child disappears for episodes on end because they aren't necessary for the plot of the show. I just really need the show to be reasonably well acted and have a good story.This show had neither. Now you can bring up the legitimate point that most of the cast are not really actors but instead dancers but it wouldn't have been impossible for the director to find a cast that was both. They just chose to employ a bunch of young dancers and hoped they could act what was often difficult emotions. They were wrong.The show also focuses often times on the wrong plots and tended to be too soap operaish which might have worked with real actors but well..,instead many of the scenes that needed genuine emotion felt flat.The dancing was good though. If that is all you care about you will probably rate this higher. But if this gets a second season I will highly question Netflix and it's renewal model.",-1,0,-1,0,-999,0,0
Tiny Pretty Things,"Pretty good, though it suffers from same problem as other shows like this. Allegiances and moods swing back and forth in the blink of an eye (too unrealistic). Also, these supposed underage kids have more sex and boozing than adults twice their ages. Don't get me started on the coed sauna--wished there was one when I was in high school. Convoluted plot points are to be expected in a soap-ish type series like this and those don't really bother me (like overlooking that Cassie has months/years of rehab ahead and is NO threat to anyone. Or, how a street cop, not a detective, has plenty of time to devote to this one case). It's basically ELITE (another Netflix show) taking place in a ballet school instead of a elite private school.

Tiny Pretty Things,"The world of ballet with its tough discipline and beautiful exploration of the human body's movement is a fascinating one. This series falls very short of engaging an individual interested in that world. The dance sequences are an inspiration and the youngsters performing them have an enviable talent. But the fascination of the series ends there, perhaps because it is too ambitious and combines a murder mystery with the day to day life of a prestigious ballet school.
Perhaps because these youngsters are trained dancers and not actors, they have failed to draw me into their natural world. There is way too much explicit sex, I understand that youngsters of this age are living through a phase of rapid hormonal growth and that leads them into sexual experimentation, but it is overdone and is frankly tasteless.
The series ended with yet another mystery that perhaps could lead to another visit to the school. I would certainly give it another try, and hopefully the problems that have made this series so lacking in depth can be sorted out.",-1,0,-1,-1,-999,-1,0

Well, I think a wooden doll can do better than most of cast, I mean, the policewoman, what the hell? She is by far the worst, and none of them has much self expression at all. Then, I agree that when there wasn't anything else to fill the minutes left on some episodes, they just resorted to nudity. I don't mind them for I did ballet and pretty much everyone is around there on underwear, and that if you are lucky. Nobody cares about whomever is around, male or female, I promise.All in all, I would say it is a mix of ""Center Stage"" with a lot of ""Gossip Girl"", a bit of ""Law & Order: UVE"", and to this they added every possible cliche from teen shows to produce the worst possible script they could manage, and this came into Netflix!

Unfortunately, because of lack of funds in Art programs in public schools the days of finding triple threat talent ( dance, sing, act) are diamonds in the rough but the soap opera style drama and the actual dancing more than makes up for the acting which seems to improve as the episodes go on. The cinematography was excellent, the color schemes and music choices were also something to appreciate. It was nice to see the diverse cast get solo dance performances and storylines.

Tiny Pretty Things,"I was apprehensive about watching this series, because anytime I've watched any movie or tv show that features real dancers in dramatic roles, the acting was always very poor.

I was also concerned, because I'm in my 40's, and teenage dramas don't usually appeal to me. Once again, I was taken by surprise at how I was still able to invest in the storylines even though I'm not of the generation of the characters. These actor/dancers are working their butts off. There are 10 episodes and each are about an hour long and feature elaborate dance sequences which make you wonder if they ever get any sleep. More good news is that the main plot is really good and the individual mini plots are interesting and sometimes very sexy. There are many plot twists and you are kept guessing until the final episode. It would be a shame if this show was not renewed for a second season. The quality of the filmmaking is so high, and the cast is so talented and works so hard. Congratulations to everyone involved.",1,1,1,0,0,1,1

The acting and plot are not going to win any Emmys, but they are not nearly as terrible as people are claiming. The story is titillating enough to keep your attention, and it's worth watching for the beautiful dancing alone. I grew up loving the movie Center Stage, and this show is like a slightly darker and sexier, up-to-date, serialized version of that. The only negative review I would agree with is that the age group is inappropriate. For the amount of nudity and sex, I would have made the characters college-aged and aimed the series at older teens and young adults rather than high school aged teens.I think the show is worth a 7 just for being entertaining and heartfelt in its commitment to portraying the dance world, choreography, and diversity, but I'm giving it a 9 to help offset the bad reviews.",1,1,1,0,0,0,0

Game of Thrones,"Was over-time on a gradual binge of watching 'Game of Thrones' from the first episode (gradual because of being so busy), having heard nothing but amazing things about it from friends, family and IMDb reviewers. Plus with such a great cast of talent and a brilliant book series, how could it possibly go wrong? The good news is that 'Game of Thrones' didn't go wrong. Quite the opposite. Not only is it a rare television show that does its original source material justice and treats it with respect but it is on its own merits one of the finest, most addictive and consistently compelling shows in recent years. A television show so brilliant that one has to actually check that it was made for television when everything is done to such a high level that it puts many films made today to shame. This is one of the strongest examples of an acclaimed show that deserves every ounce of the praise it's garnered.Visually, 'Game of Thrones' looks amazing. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. Then there are the special effects that are some of the best of any television programme and are not overused or abused, the scale, the detail and how they actually have character and soul are better than those in a lot of the big-budget blockbusters. As well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well.One cannot talk about 'Game of Thrones' without mentioning the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film.It is hard not to be bowled over by the quality of the writing, outstanding isn't a strong enough adjective to describe how good the writing is. It always has a natural flow, is layered and thought-provoking and demonstrates a wide range of emotions such as suspenseful tension, poignant pathos and witty humour. The story-lines are paced so beautifully, structured with such nuance and attention to coherence, a high emotional level and touch upon complex and sensitive themes with intelligence and tact.Whenever there's a set-piece or more action-oriented scene there's always a reason, never there for the sake of it. Not only are the set-pieces done with a lot epic scale, superb staging, excitement and dramatic tension but underneath all the scale and flashy attention to detail there is a lot of heart and a multi-layered one. They're not overlong, nor are there out of place elements.Characters are a huge part of the appeal too. 'Game of Thrones' has characters that are so well developed and as close to real life as one can get despite being in a fantasy world. These characters are not hero and villain archetypes (Joffrey is the only one close to that, the difference though is that he is an extremely interesting one with a lot of development who ranks well beyond one hundred percent on the threat level scale), they have much more to them and have strengths and flaws. Decisions are logical and one doesn't like any character any less when a decision is not the right one because mistakes are acknowledged and learnt from.'Game of Thrones' cast is full of talented names and, thanks to so well rounded characters and such great writing, nothing but the very best is gotten out of them. Even those who are not favourites of mine. Big acting standouts are Peter Dinklage, Sean Bean, Lena Headey and Jack Gleeson (Joffrey being the king of all young characters with not a redeeming bone in their body).In conclusion, absolutely outstanding and a rare television show worthy of being a cinematic modern classic. This review may sound superlatively hyperbolic, but to me 'Game of Thrones' is that good. 10/10 Bethany Cox",1,1,1,1,1,1,1
Game of Thrones,"Season OneAn outstanding television drama that helps set a new benchmark in terms of quality. The complex storyline involves the battle for supremacy between various political factions who dominate a worldscape that's as involved and complex as anything Tolkien could muster up. Each episode is riven with treachery, backstabbing, allegiances, betrayals, friendships and battle.There are 10 episodes in this first season and every one's a stunner, perfectly paced with a mix of exposition and action. The scripts are intelligent and insightful; each writer knows that it's the characters who make or break a show, and every single one of them is interesting and engaging. Despite the huge cast, it's easy to become familiar with the main players. It's hard to single out any actor for praise: Sean Bean, Lena Headey, Mark Addy, Maisie Williams, Emilia Clarke, Aiden Gillen, Iain Glen; none of them put a foot wrong, they each inhabit their role with so much depth that you forget about the actor and focus on the character instead. Peter Dinklage is perhaps the luckiest, capturing a truly scene-stealing character with wit and warmth.Season TwoIt's impossible to say too much about the many twists, surprises and genuine shocks in the show without spoiling it, but overall GAME OF THRONES remains a realistic, harrowing and exceptionally involving piece of television. A complex tableau of characters is woven and yet despite the complexity of geography, politics, allegiances and history, the viewer is never left confused, not even for a second. Season 2 ups the ante with even more explicit sex and a key climactic battle sequence that wouldn't be out of place in the likes of LORD OF THE RINGS. Despite these cinematic elements, however, the focus remains on intricate characterisation and that's what holds this show together, no matter how many truly fantastic elements are thrown into the mix.Season ThreeSeason 3 offers more of the same, with some particularly vicious torture sequences and lots more twists and turns as the plot develops. And while it's hard to pick out a season that's superior to the others, I can safely say that, when it comes, the Red Wedding is undoubtedly the highlight of the show so far; a stunning, unforgettable set-piece that never lets you go. Strong stuff indeed, just as I'd expect from what is the best thing on television at the moment.Season FourThings remain on a high-quality level with Season 4 of the show, which I think is an improvement on the previous season (as good as it was). There's no long-winded journey here with characters meeting their inevitable fate in episode 9 as there was in Season 3; instead it all feels fresh and inventive, and all of the major story lines are packed with peril and incident. Neil Marshall's epic battle in episode 9 is the highlight, but Peter Dinklage contributes some excellent acting and Rory McCann has never been better as the Hound. By all accounts this is the last season to stick closely to the plot of the Martin novels, so I can't wait to see where Season 5 goes.Season FiveSeason 5 sees the show no longer at the top of its game but it still packs a wallop as a prime piece of TV and it nevertheless knocks spots off the competition. I'd probably give this a 9/10 purely because some of the scripted lines are weak, there's a greater reliance on extraneous sex and nudity than in the previous couple of seasons, and some of the characters could have been written better. It's nonetheless as rousing as ever, with some great twists, some truly shocking character deaths, and stunning production values. The first seven episodes build up to an electric trio at the climax, with the episode 'Hardhome' containing the best set-piece of the entire series so far.Season SixSeason 6 picks up from the previous season to provide a better quality viewing experience all round. Gone are most of the extraneous story lines, with only a handful of dumb humour scenes left in. Things feel more vital here, more important than ever, and more dangerous. I particularly liked the way that the writers go out of their way to re-introduce old characters and tie up loose ends which they do very well. As before, things build to an incredible last couple of episodes, and as ever I'm left eagerly awaiting the next series.Season SevenThis penultimate season of the show is very much in end-game territory. There are only 7 episodes and they move incredibly fast, so that characters appear to be teleporting all over the world given the speed of their travel. There are less characters now so those that remain have to do more, while the spectacular, dragon-oriented action is better than ever before, with the stand-out episodes being four and six in that respect. The north-of-the-wall material is quite incredible, in fact, and harks back to the highs of HARDHOME. The rest is expensive, expansive, and thoroughly engaging, as ever.",1,1,1,0,0,1,1

Game of Thrones,"I am not one of its fans. For its childish stories, for the feeling after a season biging. But its virtues are many. And real.

For music and for the mark of HBO. For the sides of cruelty and references to mythologies and Medieval history. For a sort of genius to reflect contemporary realities.

Game of Thrones,"After its end, expecting the prequel, the things are more clear. It is a great show. Not only for the status of adaptation but for the science to be answer to many other adaptation. It is a serie of characters and their stories , more than the serie of a story itself. It is a modern fairy tale - the values and sins and failures and virtues are the same. It is a perfect trip guide across history lessons and the near every day reality. It is the perfect door to a fantastic - realistic universe. And, sure, it is GoT. Not The Lord of The Rings, not Lost, not The Tudors or Spartacus. Just and only GooT. The last season reminds this basic truth. Dragons and cruel revenge ( many from us are expressions of frustrations and drawings of wrath), old sandals and swords in new version, sex and battles and traitors, and a drop of relation Luke and Anakin Skywalker. And the end, the so infamous end for many from us, it is real perfect. For a simple reason- it is the fair eulogy of memory of humankind and the right gift to the small details defining us behind appearences. It remains, for me, more than a show, an adventure. Eight seasons. Long months expecting the next season. Impressed by cruelty, in naked expressions, by courage and generosity and loyalty. By few splendid characters. By powerful scenes as the deaths of Hodor or Tommen Baratheon. Shocked by the execution of Nedd Stark, ball of feelings behind Red Wedding. Feeling the radical transformation of Daenerys , episode by episode, admiring the battle of Winterfel, being impressed by the hard, almost crazy work of entire team.

Game of Thrones,"So I succesfully avoided major spoilers about the show and could binge watch this since the complete Box set came out in early December. The first season was a bit overwhelming, what with all the houses and characters thrown at you. As you may be able to tell, I have not read the source material. Not sure who of the cast had read it beforehand either. So bare that in mind.Now the line Winter is coming is something everyone associates with the show, I just never expected this to come up so early in the show. What is surprising, at least during the first seasons of the show, is how many supposedly main characters fail to survive. This keeps the viewers on their tows. Towards the end of the show this gets a bit watered down. Not sure how much influence the original author had there (he had only written material for the first 6 seasons of the show, the rest was made up).Having said that, you can feel a drop in quality. And while I have friend who thought the second season was boring (it's a bit of a travelling show and things get stretched quite a bit), if he continued to watch, he might feel even worse with the last seasons. Even though they are shorter (episode wise, not time wise per episode), they feel stretched even more.Also the conclusion (no worries, I'm not telling) is anticlimatic to say the least. It feels bad and the continuity errors are just thrown aside. So if not for the epic battles and the actors, who are all really amazing in this, I might have gone farther down with my vote. Then again, if it wasn't for the last season specifically, I might have given it a 10 too ... A prequel show has been axed for now (not sure if the bad reviews and or numbers for the last season played a role), but I would watch it.

Seriously, they leave little to the imagination.

Game of Thrones,"This was a show I had heard a lot about, I assumed it was one with a cult following, in fact it has become more and more popular as time and seasons go by, so I decided to get into it as well.

There are three narratives that go on throughout the show, the first being a civil war among several noble houses for the Iron Throne of the Seven Kingdoms, the second being attempts to exile the descendants of the ruling dynasty to reclaim the throne, and the third being the rising threat of the inpending winter and fierce creatures and fierce people from the North.

To be completely honest, I cannot keep up with absolutely every storyline going on, because there are so many characters, in fact I have probably only memorised less than ten of the character names. The biggest reason I keep watching is because of the exciting fight and chase scenes when they happen, the great special effects to bring dragons, ghosts, zombie and all other mythical creatures to life, the over-the-top bloody violence and deaths, and the frequent nudity and sexual activity. This does not mean I do not like the show overall, I am always interested to see what will happen next with the faces of the characters I recognise, so it is certainly a worthwhile fantasy drama. It was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Television Series – Drama (twice), it won the Primetime Emmys for Outstanding Art Direction for a Single-Camera Series (also nominated), Outstanding Costumes for a Series (also nominated twice), Outstanding Makeup for a Single-Camera Series (Non-Prosthetic) (twice, also nominated), Outstanding Sound Editing for a Series (also nominated three times), Outstanding Sound Mixing for a Comedy or Drama Series (One-Hour) (also nominated twice), Outstanding Special Visual Effects (twice, also nominated twice), and it was nominated for Outstanding Casting for a Drama Series (four times), Outstanding Cinematography for a Single-Camera Series, Outstanding Directing for a Drama Series (four times), Outstanding Drama Series (twice), Outstanding Hairstyling for a Single-Camera Series (three times), Outstanding Prosthetic Makeup for a Series, Miniseries, Movie or a Special (four times), Outstanding Single- Camera Picture Editing for a Drama Series (three times) and Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series (three times). It won the BAFTA for the Audience Award (also nominated), and it was nominated for Best International. Very good!",1,1,1,0,1,1,1
Game of Thrones,"This epic series is set in a fantasy world like no other I can think of. It has the look of medieval Europe with rival families manoeuvring to take the Iron Throne on which the Kings of Westeros sit. As the series begins Robert Baratheon is the king and he invites this friend Ned Stark to be his Hand, most trusted advisor. This leads to Ned, his wife and daughters; Sansa and Arya, moving to the capital... it isn't long before they are caught up in court intrigue. Robert's wife is involved with her own brother; it is learnt that the children of the last slain king are still alive... and there are rumours that the dead are returning to life north of the wall in the far north, where Ned's illegitimate son Jon is stationed. They are expected to attack next winter!As the series progresses rival families fight each other, form and break alliances. Other characters work for personal advancement knowing that if the move to soon or side with the wrong people their lives will soon be over. The villains are truly villainous; the heroes aren't as clear cut as one might expect. The cast of major characters is huge and events in the first season shockingly show that even those set up as lead characters can be killed off. There are fantasy elements; most notably three dragons belonging to Daenerys Targaryen; the White Walkers (the Army of the Dead); and magic of Melisandre, the Red Woman but for the most part things are gritty and real. Often that means brutal violence, quite a bit of nudity and lots of swearing... this of course means that the series won't be for everybody; however if you don't turn off in disgust in the opening few episodes you'll probably want to watch it all and love it. The cast does a phenomenal job; this includes many established actors as well as up and coming stars and people for whom this was their first acting job such as young actresses Sophie Turner and Maisie Williams who play Sansa and Arya Stark who's characters develop across many seasons in ways one wouldn't imagine when it started. There is also a stellar performance from Peter Dinklage who plays dwarf Tyrion Lannister; a character that dominates just about every scene he is in despite his diminutive size. Others who must be mentioned are Sean Bean, Emilia Clarke, Kit Harrington, Lena Headey, Aiden Gillen, Charles Dance and Jack Gleeson... to be honest I could go on listing almost everybody in it! The special effects are fantastic; one could almost believe that dragons are real after watching this. The world in which the series is set is filmed in a wide range of countries giving it a very real feel... gone are the days when a major US series set in numerous locations will be filmed entirely in Southern California or the Pacific North West! Overall I can only say 'Watch this' as I loved it from start to finish.",1,1,1,0,0,1,1
Game of Thrones,"This is a violently graphic and strong retelling about facing off among various families in an undetermined time . Nine noble families battle for control of the mythical land of Westeros. Robert Baratheon (Mark Addy) , King of Westeros, asks his old friend Eddard ¨Ned¨(Sean Bean), Lord Stark, to serve as Hand of the King, or highest official. When Ned returned to Winterfell at the end of Robert's Rebellion, he had a bastard son, Jon Snow, by an unknown woman he had met in the South. He raised Jon alongside his five trueborn children Robb (Richard Madden) , Sansa (Sophie Turner) , Arya (Maisie Williams) , Bran (Isaac Hempstead Wright) , and Rickon (Art Parkinson) . Along with the Stark family is Theon (Alfie Allen), he became a ward of Lord Eddard ""Ned"" Stark at Winterfell, and he became close with Robb . Although Ned is secretly warned that the previous Hand was assassinated, Eddard accepts in order to investigate further . Meanwhile the Queen's family, the Lannisters, may be hatching a plot to take power . There appears Tyrion (Peter Dinklage) the third and youngest son of Lord Tywin (Charles Dance) and Lady Joanna Lannister. Because of his unusual stature Tyrion has been a victim of mockery his entire life, with people overlooking his noble birth in order to tease and taunt him. Tyrion's mother died giving birth to him and his father and older sister Cersei (Lena Headey) have despised him all his life as a result. He has always maintained a close relationship with his elder brother Ser Jaime Lannister (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau), Cersei's twin . Across the sea, the last members of the previous and deposed ruling family, the Targaryens, are also scheming to regain the throne . As Daenerys (Emilia Clarke) is the only daughter of Aerys II Targaryen and Rhaella Targaryen , she is now a princess living in exile, the last of the Targaryens . But Daenerys grows into a supremely confident warrior women with perhaps the most stringent code of ethics in all the Seven Kingdoms. All while a very ancient evil awakens in the farthest north. Amidst the war and political confusion, a neglected military order of misfits, the Night's Watch, is all that stands between the realms of men and icy horrors beyond . There finds Jon Snow (Kit Harington) , the bastard Son of Lord Ned Stark by an unknown mother , it is here that the skills that were passed on to him by Ned come to light as Jon becomes a natural born leader with a strong code of ethics and an effective warrior when battling at and beyond the Wall. This is a spectacular epic dealing with friction between the houses Stark, Lannister, Baratheon and Targaryen and with the remaining great houses Greyjoy, Tully, Arryn,Tyrell and Martell and in which political and sexual intrigue is pervasive ; all of them lead to full-scale war . Breathtaking epic version based on George RR Martin novels with exciting drama and overwhelming combats , his stories are imaginatively brought to life on groundbreaking images with great production values and outstanding scenarios . Sword cross , intense drama , nudism , sexual scenes , and bloody fights abound in this spellbinding adaptation . Magnificent climatic battle scenes and struggles including lots of blood and gore ; and adding colorful computer generator images including heinous dragons . The series is well written by an excellent plethora of screenwriters as David Benioff , D.B. Weiss , Vanessa Taylor under supervision by the great creator George R.R. Martin . This author was asked if he had a resolution or ending to the seemingly endless conflict , he replied that the end would be a cloud of dust or snow being driven by the wind across a vast graveyard full of tombstones. The series takes its name from the first novel in the book series ""A Game of Thrones"" - which is actually known as ""A Song of Ice and Fire"",and most of the show is largely faithful to the books . George R.R. Martin's story credit acknowledges the entire series under this title, rather than the title of individual volumes. George R.R. Martin has stated that the infamous ""Red Wedding"" was the hardest chapter for him to write in ""A Storm of Swords."" He was so emotionally attached to the characters that he actually wrote the rest of the book first, and then that chapter last .",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Game of Thrones,"As a life-long fan of the Dungeons & Dragons roleplaying game, it is a hard thing to not be familiar with the ""Game of Thrones"" series. And yet it took me five years after the pilot to start watching it. But it should be said, then, that I haven't been able to stop watching it since I started, and I have sat through four of the seasons so far in a very short time.What works for me in ""Game of Thrones"" is the extensive storyline, with multiple houses working against one another or with one another all in order to obtain power, wealth and the crown to the realm. But also the myriad of intricate and detailed characters that are in the series, that is just spectacular. Especially because anyone of these characters can die on a whim, so you never know who is safe.The costumes are sets are fantastic, especially because there is so much attention to detail, both mundane and flashy. And it really works out so well, because you really think that you are in a medieval fantasy setting with dragons and knights. And also the special effects play a big role in the series, although not the point where the show is dependent on the special effects. Of course, having good CGI is particularly important if the dragons were to be realistic and believable.I like the politics and the alliances and feuds between the different houses and affiliations, because it is played out so well, and it is really well thought through by the creator.One thing that really is a thorn in my side if the excessive amount of nudity in the show, because it really sleazes up the series unnecessarily. The show would work out equally well with much less nudity and done in a more presentable way. But also the constant excessive use of foul language; here I am thinking of the ""F-word"" and the ""C-word"" that most of the characters are using frequently. It really seems out of place with the setting and atmosphere of the series, plus is also adds a wholly unnecessary level of unpleasantness. I am not a prude, but I think it is so frequent in the series that it is a downright annoyance.You quickly find your favorite character or characters in the myriad of colorful, quirky, scheming, bold, defiant and lovable characters. And likewise, you also quickly find ones that you most definitely do not like or even downright loathe. For me, the King Joffrey character was one that I instantly despised, he really pulled every wrong string in my being. Nothing against Jack Gleeson as an actor, it was just the character that he portrayed. And as such, when a series manages to instill such a relationship between the viewer and fictional characters, then the series is really worth watching, appealing to you on more than just an entertainment level.The slow build up of various events, and how the events have effects on the various houses and factions like ripples in a pond, really add enjoyment to the show. And you want to see more and learn what will happen next and see how the epic tale unfolds. Who will live and who will die? Who will stand victorious when the dust settles?""Game of Thrones"" is really worth watch, especially if you enjoy the fantasy genre. I am rating it a solid eight out of ten stars, and the reason for it not scoring nine or even ten stars from me is solely because of the unnecessary nudity and foul language.",1,1,1,0,0,1,1

Game of Thrones,"(Updated after Season 8)Set in a fantasy land (though, in many ways, very similar to Earth in the Middle ages) the stories of several families and individuals and their quest for power. In particular, they all want the Iron Throne...Good, epic, fantasy drama, based on the books by George RR Martin. Started extremely well: the focus on several individuals, the clever interlocking story lines, the weaving together of family feuds, power trips and pure greed and malice. Add in superb cinematography, settings, scenery and CGI, spot-on performances and some great battle scenes and we had an intriguing, engaging, action-packed drama.One of the early trademarks of the show was the principle that no character was expendable: characters, often heroes and seemingly there for the long haul, get killed off in the blink of an eye, and out of the blue. This is good and bad. Good in that it shows that, as in life, there are no certainties and ""heroes"" / very likable characters with depth aren't necessarily immortal (this is definitely not Disney!). On the other hand, it leaves you feeling distant and unengaged. It's difficult to support a character when they could be killed off at any moment.The other issue early on was that there are possibly too many stories being told simultaneously. Too many characters in the story I didn't care about (though the previous issue diluted this phenomenon somewhat!). This is particularly so in Seasons 3 and 4.While the plot is good and the characters have depth, it isn't all substance: style plays its part and sometimes the dial is too much over to the style side. Over time, style starts to overwhelm substance.This all said, it does start to come together from Season 5 onwards. Seasons 1 and 2 were good, and set up the story for some great development in Season 3. Unfortunately, Seasons 3 and 4 drifted somewhat. Season 5 gets us back on track and Season 6 propelled the story forward in a big way.Season 7 is where the individual, seemingly parallel at times, stories start to come together, as we start to effectively get one story, rather than several. It also set up the series for the final season, which promised to be a humdinger....which it certainly wasn't. Game of Thrones Season 8 would have to be one of the most eagerly anticipated final seasons in TV history...and one of the worst (and I've watched the final seasons of Dexter and True Blood!). Having created the mythical world and developed the plot to this thrilling climax, spending eight years in doing so, the writers seemed to not know how to end it. Pacing is uneven, some plot developments are quite laughable (deux ex machina, anyone...), direction is weird at times - artsy for the sake of it (Episode 3...) and there's far more style than substance (and the style feels forced).The final episode does tie things up quite neatly but more with a whimper than a bang. Very disappointing, especially considering the build-up.Less drifting in the middle seasons (even cull one or two seasons), a tighter final season and no zombies (the white walkers were a waste of time - a distraction from the real confrontation) and this would have been brilliant.",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
Game of Thrones,"... as I am writing this. If the first season seems boring to you (that seems to be the biggest complaint I've heard from people who don't like the show) just push through anyway. If by episode 10 you still aren't hooked, I'd be really surprised.It's fantasy medieval material with lots of characters, plots and settings. Almost all of the characters are interesting and multidimensional, supported by very good acting for this type of show and for the immense quantity of characters involved (and half a dozen of them bringing really high level acting talent in general). Almost every character has their own backstory that makes their actions relatable, from Tywin, whose weak father almost lost their family seat, to Joffrey who got told he is the greatest of the world from his birth and became a spoiled brat. Hardly any character has ""plot armor"", so nearly anyone can die at any second with the momentum changing completely. The dialogue is excellent, based on the excellent writing from the books. It has terrific world-building, a lot of attention to detail, amazing production value in every technical aspect (soundtrack is amazing, cinematography is impressive, the locations are great). There are great battles and special effects. It is full of unexpected but consistent plot-twists, and it's extremely focused on details and foreshadowing, which makes every scene potentially important and provides a rich ground for theories on future plots and speculation on answers for the dozens of mysteries the show introduces. It is highly immersive and dark, good things happen to bad people all the time, as bad things happen to good people, which is frustrating and infuriating most of the time, but that makes it so unpredictable and also helps with creating connections to the characters and making you really invested in what's going to happen next.",1,1,1,0,0,1,1
Game of Thrones,"It has begun! The much touted HBO miniseries A GAME OF THRONES arrived with Episode 1, and though the entire series cannot be judged on one episode, this initial hour has all the promise of an involving and visually stunning adaptation of the 1996 George R.R. Martin series of books of adult fantasy fiction titled 'A Song of Ice and Fire'. The 'game' is played by seven families - Stark, Lannister, Baratheon, Greyjoy, Tully, Arryn, and Tyrell - and what we find in the initial episode is a taste of the intrigue to come. In this first episode Lord Eddard Stark (Sean Bean) is the patriarch of House Stark, one of the major noble houses of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros and ancestral rulers of the North. Near the castle of Winterfell, Eddard's children discover a dead direwolf and five of its pups still alive. As the direwolf is the symbol of the Starks, Eddard allows each of his five children to keep one of the pups as pet. A sixth pup is discovered a short distance away from the others. It is a mute albino, and this one is given to Jon Snow (Kit Harington), the bastard son of Lord Eddard Stark. King Robert Baratheon (Mark Addy) , Eddard's childhood friend, journeys to Winterfell with his family to ask Eddard to become Hand of the King, the top adviser and military commander in the realm, due to the death of the previous Hand, Lord Jon Arryn. Eddard's wife, Catelyn Stark (Michelle Fairley), receives a letter from her sister Lysa Arryn, stating that Jon Arryn's death was a murder plotted by Queen Cersei (Lena Headey) and her powerful family, the Lannisters. Though reluctant to leave his duties and family, Eddard is convinced by his wife to accept the position in order to investigate Jon Arryn's death. Eddard's middle son Bran Stark (Isaac Hempstead-Wright) is engaging in climbing Winterfell castle's walls and towers accidentally sees Queen Cersei and her twin brother Jaime Lannister (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau) having incestuous relations. To protect their secret affair, Jaime throws the boy out of a tower window. Where the story goes form here will follow throughout the remaining episodes. Though some would criticize an early report on a series merely at its inception, it seems only fitting that offering a word on encouragement to pay attention to this new series is warranted. We can only hope that the series continues to build as it progresses. The cast is filled with excellent actors, both seasoned and refreshingly new. Grady Harp",1,1,0,0,0,1,1
Game of Thrones,"I had to watch this because others were watching it and I tried to be open minded and see what all the fuss was about. Seriously how did such a silly novel came to screen! This shouldn't have been done by HBO. It' just nerd fantasy fiction. What a derivative story! They just throw in all sorts of shocking and titillating nonsense to make a story but it's all so silly. There is just so much gross stuff: the incest, the beheading and other dismemberments, the token homosexuals, the gratuitously violent sword fighting and last but not least the ""Golden Crown"". I'm reminded of what many prominent authors and critics got together to say about Harry Potter: The sight of grown people reading the books is distressing. The same can be said of Game of Thrones. Except Game is full of so many unpleasant characters. The cast tries hard but they are wasted. They are almost all irritating and to kill of Sean Bean leaving only Lena Headey as a cast member of stature! Can't bear to think of Season 2 relying on the remaining cast. I think the worst part was watching Emilia Clarke talk that strange language for minutes on end.Were there any good points? Just the effort put in production set design and makeup. Jason Momoa does look like a human monster here. The vaguely British Irish medieval castles and settings are well done. Its just a shame so much effort went into such drivel.",-1,-1,-1,0,0,-1,1

Regrettably the later years of the series becomes formulated, redundant, and hemmed in; much like the Walking Dead series. Does anyone watch the Walking Dead anymore?

There are so many different characters, clans and families that it could be difficult to follow if you didn't pay attention. But all the characters are worth watching, every single one of them. And don't get too attached to a character because it could be over for him or her in any episode. Never saw so many main characters being killed or murdered as in Game Of Thrones. And that's a real good thing because there is always an element of surprise. In every season characters that you would think will survive die. The battles are epic, the story could go in any direction anytime. Betrayals, violence, conquests, incestuous affairs, the show has everything.

Game of Thrones,"Yes, this is sort of a middle ages feud, the Lannisters and the Starks and the battles of the 7 kingdoms from north to south. The locales range from the Wall to Winterfell, to Kings Landing. Every episode has opening credits with maps of all the kingdoms which change as events happen. Using an original book OF FIRE AND ICE, the series starts off magnificently with many power grabbing events and executions. The list of characters grows week to week, and some executions end many cast members stay on the show.The actor who is in the most episodes is a Lannister played by Peter Dinkvage.
While Peter is short in stature, his acting is high in caliber. He is nearly killed early in the series, but like a Phoenix he continues to rise from his own demise to become a power broker for the Dragon Lady. She is a Southern Ruler who owns 3 Dragons and heads a powerful army who wants to rule the 12 kingdoms. Normally, this would be an easy task.Then there are the Starks who rule Winterfell and the North. To complicate matters, there is the army of the dead. Early on in the series they only make brief attacks on small bands of troops. Then as more people are killed, the amry of the dead gets bigger and bigger and become a bigger and bigger threat. There's a lot of excellent character development in the earliest parts of this series. The middle age world of kingdoms have many interesting little asides.Then as we wind into the last seasons, an alliance is created to face the army of the dead in sort of a middle age world war. The climatic battle is long and drawn out, as the author is no longer working on the scripts and the material has diminished considerably. Overall the series quality is very high up until the segment leading to the big battle. That is when we lose character development and the series is totally immersed in the final battle.The way to watch this now is to get the DVDs and absorb it at your leisure, Is it worth watching? Definitely. Is the ending satisfactory? That depends on your point of view. It does prove that game on is more than just an hour, and it makes the Middle Age World more complicated than I ever imagined.",1,1,0,0,0,1,1

Boardwalk Empire has been the HBO series that has gained the most attention, but in all honesty I felt a little disappointed by that one. Here, it's anything but.First off, for a medieval fantasy television series, the performances are all fantastic. Every single performer steps up to the plate. Sean Benn and Michelle Fairley are as perfect protagonists as one could hope for. Yet the ones that even outshined them at times include Lena Headey (who at times you feel her pain and at times you just want to cut her head off), Nikolaj Coaster is also pretty fantastic, as is Peter Dinklage (who is the most likable Lannister!). Kit Harrington and Richard Madden are pretty incredible as well and show great future potential. The directing and writing are not over-dramatic and the story lines are actually pretty unpredictable after a while. Yet there are still many melodramatic moments, but for the better.The art direction is superb, as is the cinematography as expected. This is basically watching a film.

Instead it ended up Cersei ending up dead with Jamie when the castle was under attack and Jon Snow killing Daenerys just because she turned out to be a madhatter who killed nearly every person in Kings Landing. I totally wanted her to be the Queen of the 7 kingdoms and she was my favourite character of all time in the series. I honestly was so sad but not surprised she did die. As much as Bran is a good character, I wouldn't have thought of him as a king type like I felt it was rather forceful that they made him king and he didn't want to be king. However it was a good sign that we get to see something different on a TV show which is electing a person with a disability to be king. It gives a good insight that anyone with a physical disability can be anything they strive out to be! People were saying he was a useless character but I disagree, he was actually pretty useful when it came down to tracking the night king and letting the guys know that the night king was on the way to look for him among with his night watch a army.I like the fact George R Martin is not gonna tell us the actual ending of the Game of Thrones books as he's still writing the last two volumes. You'd think the man would give us a actual answer then a ""yes or no"" at the same time. We might as well get reading the books folks to find it out ourselves lol!The show is entertaining like it does reflect on some parts of history where European royalty from different lands would fought each other in order to gain the ultimate crown. It's just unfortunate that it couldn't have a better satisfying ending but at the same time, if you like your fantasy/medieval/comedy/bloody battle/drama/horror genres, then mate, this is totally for you! Definitely recommend this to anyone who hasn't seen GOT before, you'd be in for a ride seriously!",1,1,1,0,0,1,0
The Christmas Chronicles: Part Two,"It is saved by Goldie Hawn an Kurt Rusell. It represents not the most inspired use of a succes Christmas film. And , except few slices of decent/reasonable humor, it is a huge collection of cliches. Because all was said in the first part and this film remains a sort of mixed political correctness and special effects in the wrong package. Sure, lights and sparkles. But, except Mister and Misses Christmas , everything comes from fake to real boring. But, I hope, the target are only the very young kids.

The Christmas Chronicles: Part Two,The Christmas Chronicles was an enjoyable festive romp thanks to the star power of Kurt Russell and owed a nod to Home Alone.The sequel is directed by Chris Columbus who made the first two Home Alone and Harry Potter movies. This owes a nod to Gremlins with mischievous elves.A malevolent elf Belsnickel gradually turned to human form for being too grinchy plans to take revenge on Santa. He wants to steal the pole star that powers Santa's village.Belsnickel sends Kate Pierce (Darby Camp) who was in the first film and future-step brother Jack who are on holiday in Cancun with their parents down a wormhole to the North Pole.Kate reunites with Santa Claus (Kurt Russell) and they go looking for the missing star. Jack and Mrs Claus (Goldie Hawn) tend to the injured reindeer Dasher and bring it back to health.This is a busy sequel but strangely empty and charmless. An overlong movie that takes a while to get going.It seems to be made to order with a wishlist of ingredients that goes to make a hit Christmas movie. In turn it has no soul.Just look at the Logan airport scene where all the planes are delayed and the passengers are grouchy. Santa lifts the Christmas spirit with a song and dance routine featuring Darlene Love. All of a sudden the crowds are cheering and the planes are suddenly on schedule. Lifting the Christmas spirit. That's straight out of Elf.,1,1,0,0,0,1,1
The Christmas Chronicles: Part Two,"This is even more so a kids movie than the first one. That's not a bad thing, but as just about every review I've read for the movie here on IMDb has stated, it takes a back seat to the prior film. The story reunites Santa (Kurt Russell) with his young protagonist Kate Pierce (Darby Camp), but for some reason leaves her brother Teddy (Judah Lewis) on the sidelines for this adventure. Well, we know why the film makers did that but it just smacks of pushing an agenda. Fortunately, Kurt Russell is still in fine form as Santa Claus, with the movie delving a little into his back story starting out as St. Nicholas. I would have been disappointed if he didn't get an opportunity to sing in this one, although it would have taken a lot to top the ""Christmas Time Pretty Baby"" number from the first picture. ""The Spirit of Christmas"" tune didn't have the same punch here but on it's own was pretty good. This story had a villain by way of an elf who turned human when he broke the elves code hundreds of years ago. With the help of a wildcat named Jola and the scoundrel elf Speck, Belsnickel (Julian Dennison) wreaks some havoc before finally getting imbued with the Christmas spirit, courtesy of Mr. and Mrs. Claus (Goldie Hawn). When it was all over, he got his wish and turned back into an elf again, but to my mind, that had to be a dubious honor.",0,1,1,1,0,0,0
The Christmas Chronicles: Part Two,"When I found out that they put out a part two of ""The Christmas Chronicles"", I must admit that I was rather looking forward to watching it as the 2018 movie was rather spectacular, and a much needed addition to the holiday movie genre.Alas, ""The Christmas Chronicles: Part Two"", while it is entertaining and watchable, does suffer from being a sequel. This 2020 movie from writers Matt Lieberman, Chris Columbus and David Guggenheim just didn't have the same punch or adrenaline, nor the same wholesome family feel, that the 2018 movie had. Now, don't get me wrong here, because ""The Christmas Chronicles: Part Two"" is definitely an entertaining and enjoyable Christmas movie, no doubt about it. It just didn't stand out as being full up to scale with its predecessor.The storyline was good, although lacking the spark that drove the 2018 movie. What the storyline in ""The Christmas Chronicles: Part Two"" suffered from was that it was being a bit too generic and it seemed like director Chris Columbus was just playing it way too safe and settling on a formula that have already been used and used again in Christmas movies year after year.It should be said, though, that actor Kurt Russell is so well-cast for the role of Santa Claus for these movies. He has that special charisma and appearance that just makes it work so well, plus he is just outstanding in that role and costume. It was nice to see Goldie Hawn appear in the movie, though it was hard to remove focus from that stiff upper lip she has now. Actress Darby Camp and actor Jahzir Bruno, playing Kate and Jack respectively, also performed very well in the movie, clearly enjoying what they were doing in the movie. It was nice to hear the iconic voice of Malcolm McDowell make an appearance as well.""The Christmas Chronicles: Part Two"" is definitely a watchable movie, albeit it is a sequel after all, for better or worse.My rating of ""The Christmas Chronicles: Part Two"" lands on a six out of ten stars. Well-worth sitting down to watch, especially if you have already seen the first movie, and if you have children at your side as well, because the movie appeals to viewers of all ages.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The Christmas Chronicles: Part Two,"The first film was an enjoyable series of daft escapades full of the Christmas spirit. This follow-up introduces additional characters including the quite engaging Jahzir Bruno (who is quite decent with a pump-action pop gun) as ""Jack""; ""Mrs. Claus"" (Goldie Hawn - who has a mean way of getting kids to eat their greens) and a rather annoying Julian Dennison as the rogue elf ""Belsnickel"" who is intent on taking over Santa's toy making world. I hate puppets in films, by and large and at times this reminded me of ""Gremlins"" (1984) with a few ""Ewoks"" thrown in for good measure, and the tempo is a little more sinister as some of these elves are a just a bit too scheming. Kurt Russell is still having a ball, though and his energy and mischievous spirit keeps the role alive. The last twenty minutes give a little more for the adults watching to get into (there's even a fun sleigh duel with a nod to ""Spartacus"" (1960)) but I found the other characterisations to be a bit twee, flat even and the plot has a rather more derivative inevitability about it.

The Christmas Chronicles: Part Two,"I really enjoyed the first Netflix-produced ""Christmas Chronicles"" film from 2018 and with my wife today having spent all afternoon on her labour of love, setting up our Christmas tree this year, I was certainly enthused about our watching together its sequel as the first of no doubt a few seasonal films we'll likely catch this month.Sorry to report then that the follow-up just wasn't anywhere near as good this time around. The main characters are pretty much the same although with newly added P.C. casting as the young white girl Kate from the previous film, again played by Darby Camp and even younger new black boy Jack, played by Jahzir Bruno, end up back at the North Pole with Santa and Mrs Claus, the real-life Mr and Mrs Kurt Russell, i.e. plus Goldie Hawn, this time very much a 50/50 partnership, so much so that even Santa's Village is rechristened Mrs Claus's Village. It turns out that Kate's dad has died and she grudges her mum finding new love with her handsome black boy-friend, father of Jack, as she still clings to the memory of her old dearly-departed dad.The wider picture this time is that Christmas is threatened this year by a rogue elf-turned-human, Belsnickel who finds a way to turn all the happy little elves into nasty Gremlins, almost fatally injure Dasher the reindeer and steal the Christmas Star too. So Santa teams up with Kate and Mrs Claus with Jack in separate adventures to literally save the (Christmas) day and of course resolve Kate's issues with her old man with a ""Back To The Future"" twist I saw coming way in advance.On the positive side the CGI depictions of the magical village, the elves and Santa's sleigh were again all rendered superbly, Kurt and Goldie (even with her pneumatic lips) are cute together as Mr and Mrs Claus but the story this time was just too obvious, with its blatant references to ""Home Alone"", ""The Wizard Of Oz"" and ""B.T.T.F."" as well as being cliched and lacking in depth. I also predicted to the second just when the big musical interlude would pop up but also felt that if you have the great Darlene Love in the cast, surely have her sing her Spector-produced classic ""Christmas (Baby Please Come Home)"" and not some mediocre ""Spirit Of Christmas"" number instead. Oh, and if like me, you got bored with all the overdone SFX which overwhelm the story at the expense of plot or characterisation, you can amuse yourself by playing a game of ""Spot the Blatantly Obvious Product Placement"").Listen, it's approaching Christmas and I really should be feeling charitable at this time of the year but watching this, especially remembering the quality of the original, was like eagerly opening one of your presents on Christmas morning and finding it's just a pair of new socks.",0,1,1,0,-1,0,-1
The Christmas Chronicles: Part Two,"The Christmas Chronicles: Part Two (2020)' is certainly worse than its predecessor, never quite capturing the feeling of a proper Christmas caper. To be honest, it doesn't really feel like a Christmas film at all, despite all the festive milieu inevitably associated with Santa and his elves. Speaking of elves, the furry little freaks are given a lot more screen-time here than they were in the first flick, running amok for a majority of the movie and mugging the camera for all it's worth. They're actually quite unsettling to see in a strange way; they're cringe-worthy and overbearing, with weird visual-designs and grating vocals. After a while, it starts to almost hurt when they appear. Of course, the elves aren't the only issue with the film. Firstly, it takes absolutely ages to get going; it's almost an hour before any real stakes are introduced. Secondly, the actual adventure feels oddly rushed and underwhelming. It doesn't feel cohesive and its relation to 'saving Christmas' actually seems pretty weak. Finally, the finale is so sugary that you can almost feel your blood sugar rising. I mean, I know it's a Christmas movie and there are supposed to be hokey lessons learned but, come on, saccharine doesn't even begin to describe the auto-tuned ending. Having said all that, the thing isn't a totally terrible time. It's bad, don't get me wrong, but it isn't boring. Occasionally, it's almost fun - and I do mean ""almost"" - to laugh at. It's trying to do the right thing, too. Its highlight is actually one of its newcomers: a polite and generally personable young lad who must learn to do things independently (and that he may not actually be allergic to lactose). It's a breath of fresh air every time he comes into play. That's not to say that the other actors aren't doing a good job, though; Russell and Hawne are doing exactly what they need to. Like I said, it's not a terrible experience. It actually tries to deal with some almost 'mature' themes. It's nowhere near as good as the first, but it seems to be skewing slightly younger anyway. Perhaps it will appeal solely to little kids, rather than entire families (though the grown-ups will still have to sit through it). 5/10",0,1,-1,0,0,0,0

The Christmas Chronicles: Part Two,"A disappointment, all in all.I very much enjoyed the first film, but 'The Christmas Chronicles: Part Two' is a much weaker entry. Kurt Russell, though still enjoyable, isn't as entertaining as in the 2018 film. It is nice to see him reprise his role though, likewise with Darby Camp, Kimberly Williams-Paisley and Judah Lewis.New additions include Tyrese Gibson, Jahzir Bruno and Julian Dennison. I'm a fan of Tyrese from the 'Fast & Furious' franchise, but he is underused here; when he does feature, he's quite laidback. Bruno is alright, while Dennison is hit-and-miss; he has one or two good moments. Goldie Hawn, meanwhile, has an expanded role.The elves are as great as before, as are the special effects in general. I'd say they are probably more creative with this premise than they were with the 2018 production, but ultimately it doesn't come out as strongly - this one doesn't feel as Christmassy as its predessceor. Also, the musical number is a misfire.Close to being a good film, but just a little off unfortunately.",-1,0,-1,-999,-1,0,

The Christmas Chronicles: Part Two,"It's hard for me to determine if anyone would actually like this due to the insane change in energy from the first one. That's mainly courtesy of Kurt Russell and many of the things he does and lines he spouts in the film. But if you're able to make it at least until the kids make it to the North Pole, I'm sure you'll enjoy the remainder of the film. Russell still has consistent quality in his performance of Santa and bringing Goldie Hawn along for the ride was a nice addition, obviously having a lot of chemistry between the two on screen couple as they are a real life couple too.Something that was a bit frustrating was ""replacing"" Judah Lewis with Jahzir Bruno who seems to be trying a bit too hard. He is playing the kid of Lewis' and Darby Camp's mom's new boyfriend, Tyrese freakin' Gibson. Mainly we follow Darby Camp but considering the length of the film I would've liked to hop between another, more interesting, character. There's also a quite lengthy, and bonkers, scene where we go back in time to an airport that easily could've been cut. I completely get why it was included however in the end I question if it was even necessary.If you're a fan of 'The Office' you'll definitely be familiar with the villain of the film, Belsnickel, played by Julian Dennison who was in 'Deadpool 2'. He's an elf that was transformed into a human for being naughty and the visual effects for the elves still look horrible. Overall Dennison was okay, I didn't like a lot of the ""one-liners"" they gave him, and the bad lines as a whole is something that sadly carried over from the first one. And instead of producing this time, Chris Columbus directs his first movie since 2015's 'Pixels' which was so bad. I can't hold too much against him for that because he's made the first two 'Home Alone' movies and the first two Harry Potter movies which I criticize a lot less than most do. The story is much more contained due to the fact we spend the majority of the time at the North Pole. And the production design on the village was really good; it reminded me a bit of Hogsmeade. I don't see another one of these movies happening but who knows. As for this, if you can make it through the first roughly 20 minutes with no complaints, I'm sure you'll have a good time in the end.",1,1,1,0,-999,1,1
The Christmas Chronicles: Part Two,"I like The Christmas Chronicles 2 because it is a heartwarming film, full of magic and adventures which makes it so fun to watch. Santa Claus is not the typical Santa we are used to seeing in other movies. This Santa is a type of daredevil Santa.If you watched The Christmas Chronicles in 2018, you must know that Kate (Darby Camp) and her brother Teddy (Judah Lewis) are friends with Santa Claus, played by the one and only Kurt Russell. Kate's mom and her boyfriend Bob (Tyrese Gibson) take Kate, Teddy and Jack (Jahzir Bruno), Bob's son, to celebrate Christmas in Cancun, Mexico. Kate doesn't want to be there as she misses her dad who passed away two years ago. An evil kid named Belsnickel (Julian Dennison) wants to destroy Santa and uses Kate to get to the North Pole to do his dirty deed. Jack follows her so they both end up at the North Pole and that's when ALL the adventure begins!My favorite part is when Jack picks two of Mrs. Claus' special homemade cookies - confidence and bomb. When he needs confidence he forgets which one of the cookies is confidence and almost eats the cookie bomb. The graphics and digital effects are amazing. The reindeers and the cougar look real. The music is very appealing in every scene. The costumes are very seasonal. Mrs. Claus (Goldie Hawn) gives this movie a special touch, which makes this film different from the first movie. Mrs. Claus creates Santa's Village and takes good care of it. The movie mentions how it should be called Mrs. Claus Village, which gives this character the importance she deserves because, in reality, she is the person behind Santa, supporting him, taking care of him and his business.The moral of this movie is to move on, be happy and let others be happy. Throughout the film we learn that Kate doesn't like her mom's new boyfriend and doesn't want Bob substituting for her dad. Santa shows her that family is everything and that they matter the most, so why not cherish that her mom is happy because she found love again in Bob? Kate needs to accept that her mom loves Bob and that doesn't mean she stops loving her dad. She needs to understand her mom deserves to be happy. Life continues; people need to move on.I give this film 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 5 to 18, plus adults.

The Christmas Chronicles: Part Two,"Although it does provide some nice Christmas colors and things to look at, the unneeded sequel to Netflix's somewhat decent original Christmas flick, is sadly nothing but a hollow film with corny dialogue, mediocre acting, and a convoluted story. I love Kurt Russell, i've been a fan of his work for years, so it saddens me to say that even he isn't enough to give this film the life it hoped for. He stars again as Santa Claus, bringing all he can to the table, but between the horrible dialogue and acting, not to mention the fact that this film is dragged out at least a half an hour more than it needs to be, it sadly just isn't an enjoyable film to watch. I didn't mind the original flick, I wasn't as impressed with it as many other people I know, but I at least found it entertaining and with some good little positive moments. This film however, as sequels usually do, decides to go for the bigger is better type scenario and make everything at least twice as sweet, making it an overly sugary film that is just to corny to bear at times. The acting, besides Russell, is honestly really bad. I don't necessarily have an idea who the worst actor is, but i'm sure in the scheme of things, Tyrese comes quite close (also, why the hell is he even in this movie?). The CGI is incredibly obvious throughout, and there are a few touching moments, but in the end, the film is just too much to of a burden to be worth it. To say the least, you're better off watching the original instead.

The Christmas Chronicles: Part Two,"I feel like I've been making this argument a lot lately, but I'll say it one more time for the sake of this review. Christmas movies, especially when it comes to stories based around Santa Claus, seem to be very few and far between. Back in 2018 when The Christmas Chronicles hit Netflix, I found myself really enjoying the light tone and good-heartedness of the entire film from start to finish. For that reason alone I was looking forward to continuing the mythology that was explored. Well, The Christmas Chronicles: Part Two has now hit Netflix and while there are some very fun, family adventure to be had, it has definitely lost a bit of the magic that made the first one so enjoyable.As soon as this film began, I started rolling my eyes, wondering just how low it was going to sink after the first scene. Starting with a mysterious young man as it's very clear that his goal is to stop Santa and cancel Christmas, I found myself wondering why yet another holiday film was using a story like this. To the film's credit, there were multiple times where it proved me wrong and actually had a decent backstory for why certain things were happening, but it wasn't to the point that it changed my mind. I still found this film to be incredibly lacklustre in terms of storytelling. Where this film does soar, just like the first film, is in the wonderful casting of Kurt Russell as Santa.This time around, the kids from the first film are a little older and more mature as performers. I found that to be a breath of fresh air, especially when re-aqauiting themselves with Santa. With the addition of young Jahzir Bruno and a much more significant role for Goldie Hawn, there wasn't much to complain about in terms of the cast. Although, Tyrese Gibson plays a very small role here as a new father-figure type and I just didn't buy him as that character at all. I like him as an actor, but I don't think his performance fits this film. So as far as watching a likeable cast goes, The Christmas Chronicles: Part Two hits a home run for the most part, especially when looking at it as a holiday film that was dropped on Netflix.
Diving deeper into why this film didn't work all that well for me; I must admit that its predecessor had a very firm grasp on pace. The first film is nearly 15 minutes shorter than this one and has a much more meaningful story to tell. Sure, there are some very nice character moments and a little time travelling portion that put a little smile on my face, but it just wasn't enough throughout this nearly two-hour film to win me over. Another thing this film does is feel the need to repeat some of the best moments. The first film had a great, fun karaoke sequence that morphs into a flat-out musical number this time, which was fun, but the screenplay just felt like it took story beats from the first movie that worked and tried to inject a few new elements.In the end, I think what frustrated me the most about this sequel was the fact that the story of the first film was so enjoyable and I loved the world they put together, that this film really didn't do much with any of that. It instead took a very standard villain premise and ran with it. Although the first one didn't have me shouting to the rooftops that people desperately need to see it, I still had some mild expectations for this one and I'd be lying if I didn't say I was a little letdown. If you loved the first film, you'll probably find some enjoyment here, as I did, but it just didn't work as an overall standalone film or great sequel to me. So you can take that as a very, very loose recommendation from me if you've seen its predecessor. The Christmas Chronicles: Part Two is now streaming on Netflix.",-1,0,0,0,0,-1,-999

Home Alone 2: Lost in New York,"The first Home Alone is very good indeed. The last two are just wannabes and feel like they don't belong. Home Alone 2 is my personal favourite, and I watch it about once a month. The only problem is that the jokes are basically retreads of the first movie, but believe me, they're miles better than the ones in the fourth ( which is one of the worst movies ever) This is still a very solid film, that gets slow in the second half. The performances are excellent. Macaulay Culkin brought a lot of charm to almost all the movies he's been in. Just a shame, he isn't acting any more. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern are hilarious, as always. Catherine O'Hara and John heard are amiable as the parents, while the wonderful Tim Curry gives a hilarious performance as the Concierge. My favourite scenes were the bathroom scene in the hotel, and when the staff are held hostage by a television. Just priceless. Eddie Bracken and Brenda Fricker also make appearances, and their scenes are touching, as they are of friendship and acceptance.

Home Alone 2: Lost in New York,"Home Alone 2 (1992)*** (out of 4) A year after the events in the previous film, 10-year-old Kevin McCallister (Macaulay Culkin) finds himself alone once again but this time in New York City. It doesn't take long for him to run into Harry and Marv (Joe Pesci, Daniel Stern) who plan on robbing a toy store for some charity cash. It's funny but growing up I always thought HOME ALONE 2 was better than the original but revisiting it after all these years has me changing my mind. I was really surprised to see how this one didn't quite hold up as well as the original and I think a lot of it has to do with some pretty big errors with the screenplay. Needless to say, the main reason for this thing being made was because the first was such a massive hit. You can expect this type of sequel to be pretty much a remake as everything funny in the first film is copied here. This includes the old gangster movie with the gun, the various knocks and beatings taken by the crooks and of course the ""true"" meaning of family. All of that stuff here is still funny but it just doesn't come close to what the original offered. The biggest problem with HOME ALONE 2 is its running time, which is just way too long for this film and after a while you're really wishing that it would hurry up and end. Still, there's no question that Culkin is just wonderful here in the role that he will always be remembered for. Both Pesci and Stern are fun as the bad guys and we get nice support from Catherine O'Hara and John Heard who have to be the worst parents in screen history. Tim Curry is also fun in his small role.",0,1,0,0,0,1,0
Home Alone 2: Lost in New York,"I've always loved the first HOME ALONE film, ever since I was a kid, but I deliberately put off seeing this sequel after reading the negative reviews back in the day. Watching it now, as an adult, I can see what the reviewers meant: this is an insult, or indeed a kick in the teeth, to anyone who loves the first film.Given that the original movie was a smash hit, it was inevitably that a rushed-out sequel would quickly follow. And rushed out is right; this is a mere remake of the first film, albeit with a different setting (and nobody gets ""lost"" either, despite the title). The characters are all exactly the same, the gags are the same, everything's the same. A bigger budget doesn't mean improved quality; it means that everyone was in this to grab more dollars.It feels exactly like director Chris Columbus and writer John Hughes are going through the motions here. The bumbling villains are back and have even more ridiculous motives than previously. The crazy pigeon lady replaces the crazy old guy. Even the same TV gag is played out again. Hell, even the climax takes place in a house again, so the whole New York setting turns out to be a cheat. The whole sub-plot with the stressed out parents really drags things down a lot too.HOME ALONE 2: LOST IN NEW YORK isn't a total loss as a film, even though it's a crushing disappointment. It's hard to dislike Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern, two actors giving such physical performances. Tim Curry is a fun addition to the cast too. But Macaulay Culkin's self-knowing, superior attitude is becoming annoying already (and, indeed, his Hollywood star was to quickly wane after this) and there's absolutely nothing here that hasn't been done better previously. It's a real disappointment.",-1,1,0,-1,0,1,0
Home Alone 2: Lost in New York,"Macaulay Culkin is still cute one year later. This time Kevin gets on the wrong plane. He goes to New York and his family to Miami. Kevin is alone in the big city. With his father's money, he books into the Plaza. He must outsmart the suspicious concierge Tim Curry. Then he runs into The Wet Bandits (Joe Pesci, Daniel Stern) once again.I'm willing to accept the Wet Bandits to return in this sequel. It makes no sense, but that's not the biggest obstacle. The biggest obstacle is the repeat of the first movie. I don't understand why they feel the need to copy. They had a fun setting in the hotel. It would be so much more interesting to have the hijinx there. Kevin pulls a funny fast one on the concierge. The movie needs more of that. Imagine if Kevin had to outsmart all three of them at the same time. That would be a much better sequel.",-1,0,-1,-1,-999,0,-999
Home Alone 2: Lost in New York,"This is the typical Hollywood effort to capitalize quickly on a financial success. It's not that there isn't some fun here, but everything seems much more contrived. Of course, the fact that Kevin is left behind again is the first contrivance. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern are now the ""Sticky Bandits"" and are out of jail. The family is in New York and things begin to fall apart. Of course, what this is really about, is how much abuse one can inflict on the two idiots as they try to pull off a huge heist. Add the elements of their actions affecting poor children and the appearance of the bird lady in Central Park, we have efforts to pull at our heartstrings. Things ring hollow, mainly because the first movie did this well and this one didn't. There is one nice part of this movie and that is the byplay between Culkin and the irrepressible Tim Curry, the receptionist at the Plaza Hotel. I never miss anything Curry is in because he sparkles with evil joy. Watch this movie to see Curry. I have determined I will never invest on minute in Home Alone III.",-1,1,-1,0,-999,1,-999
Home Alone 2: Lost in New York,"While this has some very entertaining moments, this is really an unnecessary sequel to the first installment of one biggest box office hits of the 1990's. In retrospective, even the first film doesn't hold up nearly 30 years later, being rather violent and cartoonish featuring a family I certainly would not want to be any part of. While this time indeed, the Macaulay Culkin character of Kevin does make it on to the plane, it's the wrong one and he ends up in the wrong City. While his family ends up being stuck in the hotel because of constant rain in Florida, Kevin makes it to sunny Manhattan where once again he encounters the nasty Crooks played by Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern. Christmas in New York is said to be magical, and it's up to Culkin to find ways of passing the time while his mother, Catherine O'Hara, strives to get there so she can find her son home she is frantic of having lost for the second time over the Christmas season.The characters play by Stern and Pesci have outworn their welcome, and this time the violence tossed at them by Culkin in an abandoned family home seems to be twice as ruthless, not that they don't deserve it. But in reality, there is no way anybody could survive any of the self defense ploys that Culkin throws at them, so that aspect of the plot line becomes quite eye-rolling as it goes far too over-the-top.That means that the film is best when it deals with the colorful characters of New York, particularly Brenda Fricker as a Central Park bird lady, Eddie Bracken as a kindly toy store owner and Tim Curry and Dana Ivey as imperious front desk clerks at the Plaza Hotel. What does become equally as irritating as Stern and Pesci is Kevin's family, especially his obnoxious older brother who creates a major disturbance at a Christmas concert Kevin has a solo in that in defending himself, Kevin causes the entire presentation to fall apart. Shots of New York around the holidays bring on a feeling of nostalgia, especially with many businesses which are no longer around as well as a nice shot of the Twin Towers less than a decade before they were destroyed. A cameo by a certain overrated celebrity turned politician is fortunately extremely fast and other than a quick ""eew"" at the side of them is only a minor disturbance. In true Hollywood fashion, this was not the end of the saga, but the last one in my opinion worth bothering with. I used to rank this as much higher in rating, but other than a few sweet moments, including a thoughtful one involving a pair of turtle dove tree decorations, it does not hold up as well as it did on my first viewing when it first opened in theaters.",-1,0,0,0,-999,0,1
Home Alone 2: Lost in New York,"When I heard Daniel Stern speak at Lewis and Clark College in September, 2004, he explained that in the case of ""Home Alone"", everything was pretty ridiculous, but at least they only did it once; he affirmed that with the second one, they just repeated everything. He's right. ""Home Alone 2: Lost in New York"" does repeat everything. And is it really appropriate to make various and sundry injuries look funny? Personally, I don't know why they have to make sequels (for the record, there was even another sequel or two after this one; fortunately, this was the last part of the franchise that I ever saw). All that I can say is: trust Daniel Stern and avoid this movie.",-1,-999,-1,0,-999,0,0

Physical slapstick routines that made audiences laugh before are recycled--and damned if viewers don't fall for it all over again. There's obviously something comforting in watching a bright, big-budget sequel to a popular family comedy that covers familiar territory (one can sit back, brain in check, and let the picture do all the work), but Hughes' scripted banter is witless, and new characters such as Tim Curry's inept, leering concierge and Brenda Fricker's Pigeon Lady are oddly lacking in humor and charm. ** from ****",0,0,-1,0,0,0,0
Home Alone 2: Lost in New York,"When you watch this film for the first time, you can ask yourself this question ""was it useful to make a sequel to one of the most successful films made in 1990?"". The answer is obviously not. The only interest of the film is commercial. Indeed, John Hughes and Chris Colombus felt like renewing with the huge success of ""Home Alone"". Although this film was average, it was quite funny but, here, its sequel is very poor and disappointing. The film takes back too many elements from the first and as a consequence, it doesn't create surprises any more. For example, when Kevin is at the Plaza Hotel, he's watching, apparently, a detective film, and we know that the man, in the film, will kill the young lady as it was the case in Home Alone with the two men on the video. On the other hand, Kevin's weird neighbour was considered a slayer for a long time; but then Kevin found out that he was an unhappy man. In the film, a tall woman who brings up pigeons took the place of Kevin's neighbour and like this man, she's apparently threatening, but then again, like the man, she had a miserable life. So the film is deprived of originality. Moreover, the screenplay is always predictable and sometimes it's unlikely: Kevin's traps are more dangerous than in the previous film and however the two burglars don't seem to suffer a lot. At last Daniel Stern and Joe Pesci aren't very funny, Stern is even ridiculous and dumb. In 1997, a third sequel was made but with a different actor instead of Macaulay Culkin in the main role. Let's hope, there won't be a fourth.",-1,0,-1,0,0,0,-999
Home Alone 2: Lost in New York,"Home Alone 2: Lost in New York is a Christmas family comedy that was written and directed by John Hughes and Chris Columbus respectively.It was a sequel to the highest grossing holiday comedy,Home Alone.Macaulay Culkin returns as Kevin McCallister,who in the story is once again left on his own by his parents and once again goes up against his former nemeses who tried to rob their house,the Wet Bandits,portrayed by Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern.Catherine O'Hara, John Heard, Tim Curry, and Brenda Fricker are also featured.Once again Kevin McCallister's family leave him behind.This time,he he gets on a flight to New York instead of going with his family to Miami.

But then he runs into his old enemies Harry and Marv. When he finds out that they plan on robbing the old man's toy store on Christmas Eve,he tries to stop them from succeeding and battles again them just like in the original film.While this sequel is almost the same plot as the first film,it still manages to provide joy and entertainment to the viewers.Kevin surprisingly was able to show a few tricks as he goes up against his enemies especially being left alone in a big city like New York.The performance of the cast was good.Special mention should be given to Culkin and Pesci as Kevin and Harry.Despite the fact that it provides nothing new,it is still fair to say that the sequel was not bad and it would probably be comparable to the original film.No wonder a lot of people still saw it when it was theatrically released.",0,1,0,0,-999,0,0
Home Alone 2: Lost in New York,"MACAULAY CULKIN is back again as the little lost boy who seems to have the ability to lose his parents at airports in HOME ALONE 2: LOST IN NEW YORK. While the plot fails to be as engaging as the original, a big asset is all of the New York location photography that gives us great glimpses of the big city for an added dose of realism.It starts out pretty much the way the original did, with the family planning a Florida vacation and with Kevin pursuing all of them as they make a mad dash through the airport. This time, he doesn't deliberately stay behind--he mistakenly believes he's following a man wearing a coat similar to his father.But what's really missing are the characters that made HOME ALONE such a treat--and they aren't topped by the bird lady sequence and her friendship with the boy, nor are the bungling exploits of bad guys JOE PESCI and DANIEL STERN as funny, even though they are as clueless as ever in trying to deal with Culkin's nasty pranks.The violence employed by Culkin gets even nastier this time, which turns out to be a drawback because, after all, this isn't a cartoon where we know no one is really getting hurt.But in general, the story moves swiftly, the parents' reaction to discovering that he's lost is just as funny (as is their encounter with an official while trying to explain the situation), and the supporting cast does their best to keep things lively. Nice to see EDDIE BRACKEN as a toy store mogul in a huge toy store where a key scene takes place.Fans of HOME ALONE will no doubt appreciate this sequel, but they aren't likely to be as fond of it as the original--which had a wistful sort of charm totally lacking here. John Williams' score is a pleasing asset, once again providing a sprightly backdground that gives the film added cheer.",0,1,0,0,0,0,1

Cue the Donald Trump cameo!The format from the first film is largely followed, but despite being perhaps a little overlong, it all works and is good fun.

Home Alone 2: Lost in New York,"The whole gang returns for this sequel. Kevin is at odds with his family once again come Christmas time, and makes the same mistake he did in the first movie. Wishing his family would go away, once more. Kevin gets his wish, when he stops to look for batteries in his Dad's bag for his tape recorder at the airport. He boards the wrong plane, and is stranded all alone in New York for Christmas. Unfortunately, the Wet Bandits have escaped from Prison, and are in New York as well.The first Home Alone is one of my favorite movies. (I will review it one of these days!) I even own this movie, despite having issues with it. It's still a fairly entertaining film, but I just felt they tried to outdo the first film with a bigger setting, and more violent gags. New York is a huge place, and I'm sure they thought this would be ever better than the original when they thought of it. It doesn't work in the long run, and it doesn't have the genuine feel of the first film. It feels like most sequels, a cash maker. It's also somewhat of a rehash of the original. The Pigeon Lady (Brenda Fricker) is essentially the same as Marley the enigmatic neighbor (Roberts Blossom) who befriends Kevin in need, and gets him out of jams. It wasn't nearly as special as the bond Kevin & Marley had. The Wet Bandits (Brilliantly played by Joe Pesci & Daniel Stern) make the same mistakes they did in the original with Kevin, by falling for the same traps. You'd have thought they might have learned a bit after the first one The violence is cartoonish in the original, but it didn't bother me. It's one of the many things I loved in the original, but here it borders on overkill. Onto the positive side of things, Macaulay Culkin is once again hilarious as Kevin. He is a main reason as to why I enjoy this movie. The Plaza Hotel crew is a scream. Tim Curry, Rob Schneider & Dana Ivey are all very funny. Look out for cameos from Ally Sheedy & Donald Trump as well.Final Thoughts: Bigger, doesn't necessarily mean better. As disappointing as it is, I do enjoy this movie to an extent, but it's nowhere near the original's class.

Home Alone 2: Lost in New York,"This is another of those sequels that... suffer(?)... from a not entirely uncommon illness, known as ""The T2 Syndrome"". Terminator 2 may not be the origin of said illness, or even the first film to fall victim of it, but it is commonly accepted as the first recorded case of it. The syndrome renders any sequel as more of a remake of the first than an actual sequel, but the quality is a variable, it can go either way(or nowhere at all). Usually, everything in the film is kicked up a notch, higher production value, more action and more entertainment... sometimes signifying a higher budget. These films are often a desperate attempt by the film-makers to re-create the success of the first without breaking new ground or showing any originality or creativity. For whatever curiosity value it may hold; Charlies Angels: Full Throttle is another victim. As a victim of this illness, the film contains scene after scene(in fact, it's put together by them, it consists entirely of them) that are mild re-writes of scenes from the first. The plot is basically the same, and at best, fairly interesting. The minor lift the film has received in content, the fact that everything is just slightly 'more' than it was in the first makes for a few entertaining scenes scattered throughout the film(good thing, because without them, the film is barely worth watching at all). Apart from the entire original cast(well, the foundation, at least; the McCallister clan is back) returning for this sequel, we are also joined by the comedic talents of Rob Schneider, Tim Curry and Dana Ivey(I know, I know, but think of how she was in the Addams Family films, seriously), which pays off big time. The pacing is fine. The acting is mostly goofy and overplayed, which I suppose is the idea. The humor works, on occasion. There is one thing I just have to say; I don't much mind the silly humor of most of the film, but at the end... when it turns to slap-stick, Looney Tunes-like humor... that was just too much. It was bad in the first, this time, it's worse. I could barely watch. I found myself turning away again and again, taking longer and longer to look back at the screen. The content disgusted me. This is coming from a man who, in the last week, has seen Dawn of the Dead, Saw and Hellraiser: Hellseeker... during which, I never turned away, or, for that matter, regretted that I hadn't. The tone is just too much in this film, during those last scenes. I don't know what disturbs me more; the fact that I, myself, as a child, enjoyed these scenes. The fact that as I write this, there are children enjoying them. Or the fact that there are grown people... not only enjoying watching them, but thinking that it's OK, that it's OK to put that in (children's) films, to tell children that it's OK. That it's responsible. That children may, or even(*shudder*) should think that. It disturbs me. Quite a lot, in fact. That aside, the film does a nice job, through cinematography and dialog, to show the world as seen by a young child... of course, that only makes aforementioned fact even worse. I only recommend this film for people studying films, so they can analyze and debate it, get into the frame of mind behind this film, understand it. Anyone else watching it should take great care to understand that it is, in fact, fiction, and has very, very little to do with reality. I wouldn't consider this proper viewing for kids, unless these are very mature and understand that it's not real. 6/10",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

In due course he falls foul of Harry and Marv, the single minded but dim crooks from the first movie - they want revenge on him, he wants to foil their plan to rob a toy store, and the stage is set for a reply of the siege, full of slapstick violence, and taking place this time in the shell of a brownstone which is in mid-renovation. Finally there is - guess what? - a sentimental resolution.Yes, the siege is violent, but the violence is cartoon violence: although Marv and Joe are hurt, things which would in reality kill them simply leave them somewhat stunned, following which they get up and resume their single-minded pursuit of Kevin.I cast my vote, too, for the bricks and the way the sequence keeps you waiting for a variation which never comes.

Catherine O'Hara and John Heard as Kevin's parents more or less sleepwalk through this junk. We are given that closeup realization of O'Hara where she screams, ""Kevin!""

The additions to the cast include Tim Curry as a rather arrogant hotel person, and a bag lady who will teach young Kevin (I think that is the brat's name) some sort of lesson though you think he would have learned enough lessons after his last fiasco, but then how would we have the sequel which is obviously one of those sequels they rushed to get made like they did with the ""Look Who's Talking"" first and second movie and when they rushed ""Moonraker"" after ""The Spy Who Loved Me"" and ""Batman and Robin"" after ""Batman Forever"". All those examples basically use the same blue print for there movie so you end up with essentially the same movie with a few new moving parts here and there and considering I hated the first one the change in venue did not do anything to make me like this one any more or less.

Home Alone 2: Lost in New York,"Home Alone 2: Lost in New York is a sequel that is almost identical in quality and plot to the first. The first film was a fresh new idea, but often misunderstood by people who weren't taking into consideration it was an exercise in childhood escapism. When you can look past its implausibility, it's a unique and amusing film for many, but different generations and different audiences will gradually differ in responses.Now we have a sequel, which right off the bat sends me into useless quibbles. He doesn't have a home in New York, so how is he home alone? This could've easily been its own stand alone film if the characters were all different and just be called the film's subtitle ""Lost in New York."" But would it sell as well? Probably not. So bring back the three actors and we have ourselves a sequel.The plot seems to be lifted directly from the original film. Due to a severe mix-up at the airport where Kevin (Culkin) follows a man wearing the same coat as his father, he is taken on a flight to New York instead of with his family who is going to Florida for Christmas. Kevin fearlessly checks himself into a hotel, gets settled in, then realizes the criminals he beat the hell out of (Pesci and Stern) in the first film come back and now have placed him back in their cross-hairs.From there on out the plot becomes more jokes about being hit on the head and running away frantically. I give Macaulay Culkin a boatload of credit for not being one of the childhood actors like the ones on Full House where they spend a lot of their time standing still and looking cute. Culkin provides cute, boyish charm while creating eventful mishaps on screen. Just like in the first film; some antics are funny, some are redundant without being funny.We also get a strange subplot with an old woman who enjoys feeding pigeons. She has been considered the ""old creep"" in town and has been shunned by her peers. That's how Kevin feels with his big family most of the time. Their connection is slim, but acceptable. While at the same time it feels almost contrived and not a very needed subplot. It does rest the tired hit-on-the-head jokes that have been hit over our head, pun intended, during the course of the film.Home Alone 2: Lost in New York provides some nice shots of New York, some decently executed dialog, and delightful cameos like Ally Sheedy, Donald Trump, and, my favorite, Tim Curry. The only downside is you're watching the same film. It still fuels the ""childhood escapism"" tank like I mentioned before, but it does hardly anything new with it. It just rehashes a formula previously seen before. More imagination to the story could've been taken into consideration.Or maybe, just not have a sequel at all. The first was an unexpected success, it did very well in theaters, and is still played repeatedly during the holiday season. The concept of a child being left alone to fend for himself by accident is a possible thing. Unfortunately, the sequel does little to expand the idea except by removing the four walls barricading the kid in the first film and giving him a full city to work with. A lot happens in this two hours. Quite a lot of things. Plausible or not, it's beginning to get very redundant. I suggest parental counseling and a dog leash.Starring: Macaulay Culkin, Joe Pesci, and Daniel Stern. Directed by: Chris Columbus.",-1,1,0,0,0,1,1

Not too many folks are just giving it a good chance. I mean, the Wet Bandants are back and they are just as funny as ever!

The reason I'm giving it a ten is because I think the rating should be higher. People really need to give this movie a shot. My favorite scene is without a doubt when Marv gets hit in the face with the bricks, also, the scene where the Plaza Hotel managers are asked by Kevin's mom ""What kind of idiots do you have working here?!""... the lady just smiles and says ""The finest in New York!"", it was just too funny! I love this movie and I'm always going to recommend it for a good watch, I think you'll enjoy it if you give it a chance.10/10",1,1,1,0,-999,1,0
Home Alone 2: Lost in New York,"Home Alone 2  Some Minor SpoilersHe's up past his bedtime in the city that never sleeps.After the tragic events of the first `Home Alone' film, a now ten-years-old Kevin McCallister is having a bit of a problem. He's been left by his family. Again. Only this time, he's not at home. He's home alonein New York City! And  wait for it  there are some reminiscent faces in this sequel that may be more than reminiscentcriminals Harry and Marv are in NYC too, and they have payback for young KevinThe original cast and crew are reunited for an all-too-familiar sequel in this star-studded comic fantasy.Macaulay Culkin is (supposedly) ten or twelve in this sequel. I can't remember. Anywho, he looks almost exactly the same as he did in the last film. Maybe that's because `Home Alone 2' was filmed barely a year after the first was released, giving Culkin little room to grow. `H:2' is basically the height of Culkin's career before he went on to star in flops such as `The Good Son' (not only a box office flop, but an awful, dull movie).
John Heard and Catherine O'Hara are back as well, as Peter and Kate McCallister. Thank goodness they got them back for the sequel, otherwise, this would have been a bad movie.But the actors that I am very surprised they got back for this sequel, and both really made this movie, are Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern as Harry and Marv respectively. After Pesci and Stern's characters escape from jail, they come to New York and spot Kevin walking down the street, and instantly plan on getting revenge, all the while planning a heist of a toy store on Christmas Eve! That's where Kevin steps in and creates some all too familiar (literally the exact same as the first) booby traps to stop the thievesThis movie takes some fresh scenes  Kevin checking into an expensive hotel with his father's credit car  but never enough. Almost all the scenes are re-hashed from the original, leaving little room for new material. They even go for a sentimental bird-lady scene, much like the one with the shovel man from the first movieNevertheless, the sequel still has some good moments. Hotel owner Tim Curry walking into the hotel room and seeing the outline of a man in the shower comes to mind (Kevin has an inflatable clown his Aunt bought him in the shower to fool Curry), and I only wish they had come up with some more original booby traps at the end. That's the downfall of this film.
With a few more cameos than the first film (Herbert Hoover), `Home Alone 2: Lost In New York' is worth seeing, even if originality isn't its main trait. I also wish they could have brought back John Candy as a small cameo (reprising his role as Gus Polinski: Polka Band Chief) for the film, but they didn't. Oh well. There are some other good stars in this film, anyway`Saturday Night Live' skit man Rob Schneider co-stars.3/5 stars (as opposed to 4.5 for the first film)John Ulmer",0,1,-1,0,0,0,0
Klaus,"Jesper is a selfish and lazy young man. And, to teach him a lesson, his father sends him to work as a postman in the hellish Scandinavian town of Smeerensburg. Why is the place so bad? It's incredibly unfriendly and gray....with locals constantly feuding with each other for generations. And, considering the locals can't stand each other, no one ever wants to write a letter....and Jesper has absolutely nothing to do but count the days until he can leave the place!
One evening, a dark and scary stranger, Mr. Klaus, shows up and demands that Jesper delivers a present to one of the kids in town. Over time, the traditional Santa myth is created in the story--with kids writing letters to Santa Klaus, reindeer and the whole kiboodle. But what about Jesper? His time to leave is approaching...and he's actually doing so much good.This is a gorgeously animated and beautiful film. I loved the combination of CGI and traditional animation and the story kept my interest because it had heart and was occasionally rather funny. Well worth seeing and clearly a reimagining of the Christmas special from 19970, ""Santa Claus is Coming to Town"".UPDATE: I saw this film again and noticed a couple minor problems I didn't notice the first time. First, the heavily auto-tuned music really didn't fit the film. Second, the art style seemed to change a lot throughout the film...like they were making changes in the character design.",0,0,0,0,-1,0,-1
Klaus,"Jesper (Jason Schwartzman) is a spoiled young man who fails at his job which was given by his Postmaster General father. As a disappointment to his father, the father sends him to the kingdom's far north island and offers him a deal to come back to the comforts of home after 6000 letters. The locals have ongoing feuds and generally express themselves in person rather than in letters. With a desperate need for any letters at all, he goes to the far end of the island where he finds an old reclusive toymaker named Klaus.Animator Sergio Pablos tries his hand in filmmaking and hits the first pitch out of the park.

Klaus,"I usually feel weird when I see or hear anything Christmassy before or after late November or December, but with this English-language Spanish Netflix made cartoon movie getting attention during Awards Season, I was prepared to make an exception and it watched it in early February. Basically, set in the 19th century, Jesper Johansson (Jason Schwartzman) is the lazy and spoiled son of a wealthy Postmaster General. He is enrolled into the postman training academy; his father hopes to reform him. But Jesper deliberately underperforms, forcing his father to give him an ultimatum. He is tasked with delivering six-thousand letters within a year, on the distant island town of Smeerensburg. If Jesper fails, he will be cut off from the family estate. On his arrival, he meets sarcastic ferryman Mogens (Norm Macdonald) and bitter teacher-turned-fishmonger Alva (Rashida Jones). Jespers finds out that most of the town's populace is made up of the Ellingboes and the Krums, two warring families, along with many other miserable people who hardly exchange words, let alone letters. For some time, he tries desperately to find a way to post letters but finds no mail to be collected from any of the houses on the island. But then on the map in his office Jesper notices that there is an isolated dwelling at the far end of the island. He travels there and discovers a reclusive woodsman named Klaus (J.K. Simmons) with a house filled with handmade toys. Jesper is terrified by the large man with a big white beard and flees, inadvertently leaving behind a sad drawing he took earlier made by one of Smeerensburg's children. Klaus forces Jesper to lead him to the boy's house depicted in the drawing, and then makes Jesper secretly deliver a toy to the boy inside. Word of this event spreads to other children, each believe that they will receive a toy if they send a letter, so they visit Jesper the next day. He capitalises on the idea and goes to Klaus to propose he donates his variety of toys; Klaus agrees on the condition that they operate at night, and that Jesper continues to deliver the toys in secret. Soon, more and more children begin writing letters to Klaus. Jesper decides not to give a child known for misbehaviour and bullying no toy, instead leaving a lump of coal. He tells the children that Klaus only gives toys to good children, he says that Klaus always knows when any child misbehaves, and he has a ""naughty list"". The acts of kindness that follow inspire the rest of the townsfolk to end their ancient disputes, and Alva reopens her school to help the children learn to read and write. Eventually, Jesper and Klaus begin running out of toys to give to the children. With the end of the year and Jesper's deadline coming up, he tries persuading Klaus into making more toys in time for Christmas. There is a misunderstanding between Klaus and Jesper, after which they reconcile, and they work together to make a sled for a small Sámi girl named Márgu (Neda Margrethe Labba), who lives in an isolated settlement with her people. Klaus finally opens up to Jesper, he tells him about his wife Lydia, explaining he made the toys to give to children the couple hoped to have but never did, and Lydia eventually died from illness. Klaus has realised their work has been spreading joy to the children and agrees to the Christmas plan. As the town and his relationship with Alva flourishes, Jesper finds himself wanting to stay in Smeerensburg. Family elders Aksel Ellingboe (Will Sasso) and Tammy Krum (Joan Cusack) want to resume the traditional feuding, they form a temporary truce in order to stop Jesper and Klaus. They trick Jesper's father into coming to the island, made to believe Jesper has posted fourteen-thousand letters, he arrives on Christmas eve to congratulate his son, inadvertently revealing to Jesper's friends the selfish reasons for his deeds. Just as they are about to leave town, Jesper's father notices his son's remorse, and after a talk he allows Jesper to stay in Smeerensburg. The elders and their gang chases after Klaus travelling with a sleigh filled with wrapped Christmas gifts. Jesper tries to stop them and apparently fails. The elders leave believing they have destroyed the toys and restored traditions to the town, however Alva had been informed of the plot by the town's children, so she and Klaus had already replaced the toys with decoys. Jesper is redeemed, and Smeerensburg becomes a happy town, with the family elders being forced to end the family feuding due to the marriage of their children, Mr. Ellingboe's daughter and Mrs. Krum's son. Jesper marries Alva and raises two children, and he and Klaus continue to deliver presents in Smeerensburg and beyond for eleven years. On the twelfth year, Klaus follows a gust of a wind calling him and disappears, seemingly to join his departed wife. Every Christmas Eve from then on, Jesper sits beside the fireplace and sees the spirit of Klaus continues to deliver toys to children around the world. Also starring Sergio Pablos (the director, writer and producer) as Pumpkin / Olaf and The A-Team's Dwight Schultz as Additional Adults Voices. This is a terrific alternative story of the origins of Santa Claus, with a postman deep in the Arctic Circle that, with the help of a toymaker brings joy to a cheerless community, and everything you may expect is covered, from reindeer pulling a sleigh, to children being naughty and nice. It also has a great cast of actors as the voices, and the animation is of course impeccable, it is a little darker than traditional Christmas movies, but that actually makes it more interesting, and it does warm the heart at the right moments, it is a worthwhile seasonal animated comedy-drama. It won the BAFTA for Best Animated Featured Film, and it was nominated the Oscar for Best Animated Feature Film. Very good!",1,1,1,0,0,1,1
Klaus,"Here's a re-imagining of the holiday tradition of Santa Claus and how he came to deliver Christmas presents to good little boys and girls. I got a kick out of the 'lump of coal' treatment for those who didn't toe the line with their parents. I don't know how long that's been a troublesome mainstay, but it was well in place some sixty odd years ago when I was looking for gifts under the Christmas tree. The story starts out as a bit of a competition when a young layabout named Jesper Johannson (voiced by Jason Schwartzman) is assigned the task of achieving a goal of six thousand letters sent from the island outpost of Smeerensburg. Initially hitting the proverbial brick wall in a town of feuding families, Jesper is handed a lifeline when a burly widowed carpenter named Klaus (voiced by J.K. Simmons) decides to mail one of his many home made toys to an unfortunate young lad of the town. The idea snowballs, so to speak, and soon, all the kids in town are writing letters to Klaus to let him know how obedient and well mannered they were all year. With colorful animation in what I like to call a sort of wood-block style, ""Klaus"" is a fine, family friendly Christmas film that will join the ranks of other holiday movies as an annual event. In fact, after only three months since it's release in November, 2019 (as I write this), it rates a number five position in my list of IMDb viewer rated Christmas movies, joining 1966's ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" (#3) and the prior year's ""A Charlie Brown Christmas"" (#4) in the Top Five. So a word of advice to future film makers, when it comes to Christmas. clever and original animated pictures seem to be the ticket.",1,1,1,0,0,1,1
Klaus,"Jesper, a trainee postman, comes from a privileged background and is determined to coast through life. However, his father, the postmaster-general, has other ideas. He sends Jesper to the furthest-flung post office in the country and issues him with an ultimatum: process 6,000 letters in a year or he is cut off from the family fortune. Upon arrival, Jesper finds that the town has been drawn into a bitter feud between two rival families. He also finds a strange, scary old man, Klaus.A children's Christmas movie, and not much more. The plot had potential, as it tells how Santa Claus and the traditions and legends surrounding him came into being. The way the writers weave these into the movie is fairly interesting and entertaining.However, the rest is, for the most part, quite predictable and hum drum, consisting of your usual child-focused hijinks and the like. The fact that the ""hero"", Jesper, is an unlikable slacker doesn't help the engagement level either.This said, there is a sweetness and innocence to the movie that make up for general ordinariness of proceedings. The sub-plot involving the little girl who couldn't speak English was particularly heart-warming.Overall, the sweetness and message tip the movie into the ""liked"" basket.",1,0,1,-999,1,0,1
Klaus,"Whilst I was vaguely aware of the title from seeing it mentioned at the Oscar's, I became aware of Klaus from seeing a large number of fellow reviewers highly praising the film this year,which led to me meeting Klaus.View on the film:Revealing later that he had wanted to do a traditionally animated feature film, but he wanted to see how the animation would have evolved without the switch to computer-generated animation, the 20 years spent working in various other animation departments, leads to co-writer/ (with Jim Mahoney & Zach Lewis) and co-director (with Carlos Martinez Lopez )Sergio Pablos make a chart-topping Christmas number one directing debut.Developing the project for over a decade, Pablos and Lopez ultra-stylised use of volumetric lighting and texturing, (first time to be used in hand-drawn animation) gives the animation a dazzling depth of field appearance, with the detailed, expressive hand-drawn character animation seamlessly blending in with the thick texturing given to the background and buildings drawing a pop-up book elegance.Later revealed by Sergio Pablos that he had improvised 40% of the dialogue,Jason Schwartzman gives a fantastic turn as Jesper,thanks to Schwartzman voicing his distinctive kookiness with a growing can-do confidence,whilst J.K. Simmons brings a merry, towering warmth in his merry performance of Klaus.Simply having a wonderful Christmas time in a miserable town, the writers gloriously take the characteristics of Santa (such as flying reindeer)and turn them inside out with hilarious sight gags that soar with excellent drama from Jesper bonding with the locals,and Klaus coming out from the wilderness, to discover the true meaning of Christmas.",1,1,1,1,1,0,1

It's a tale of two halves and Klaus at the very least, ends on a touching note and finishes well overall.

Klaus,"Exhibiting all hallmarks of a Christmas classic which it is destined to become in the years ahead, Klaus is a whimsical, wistful & wondrous delight that's crafted with passion, told with affection & is catapulted to new heights by its gorgeous animation to finish as this festive season's most wonderful surprise.Written & directed by Sergio Pablos in what's his directorial debut, Klaus marks the arrival of a new animation studio in the arena, and is a promising start to its filmmaking endeavours. Pablos goes old-school by employing traditional hand-drawn animation and the wizardry he conjures on the canvas provides his film a unique look.What's more commendable is that despite the groundbreaking animation, it's the story & characters that take precedence. The premise is heartwarming, characters are well-defined & it is cleverly witted. The frozen, faraway setting is perfect spot for origins of Christmas myth, and the way the cold palettes transition to warmer tones as plot progresses is mesmerising to watch.On an overall scale, Klaus is a beautifully evocative & emotionally resonant tale of goodwill & compassion that's sprinkled with healthy dose of heart & humour and comes enveloped with magical flair. A hilarious, heartfelt & joyous celebration of the good deeds that bring us together, Klaus is a blissful marriage of storytelling & animation mastery, and is arguably the best animated film of the year.

Klaus,"Very similar to that of the 1970 Rankin & Bass stop motion special 'Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town'; this motion picture tells an alternate fictional tale of the origins of the Kris Kringle myth, independent from the historical version of Saint Nicolas. Kinda glad they did that rather than digging too deep in the complex & highly complicate biblical story. That choice would bog the story down. Although I doubt diehard evangelicalism would feel the same. They probably would have love to see more of that or a mention of Jesus Christ. Anyways, set in the Far North of some unnamed Nordic country, 'Santa Claus is Comin' To Town' and this flick rotated around a postman telling the story of how a thoughtful toymaker brought joy to a gloomy isolated village. Although this movie written and produced by animator Sergio Pablos's company in his directorial debut told the tale much better. Even if the mailman named Jesper voiced by Jason Schwartzman was a bit annoying. Nonetheless, the postman did improve overtime in the movie's character development arc. However, the third act break up trope seem a bit overdramatic and harsh. Without spoiling this holiday picture too much, what he did wasn't really that awful. The other characters were doing similar things such as Alva (Voiced by Rashida Jones) a teacher turn fishmonger. It felt a bit out of character for her to get angry about his initially selfish plans when Alva was trying to leave the city at one time as well. She was really hesitant about wanting to teach the children even when they started to show up at her school. For her to turn her back on him felt like the pot calling the kettle black. It made no sense. As for Klaus (Voiced by J.K Simmons). He's no saint too. Forcing another person to break and enter houses at night rather than talking to the parents about the gifts is pretty bad enough. Yet as a woodsman who probably first arrive in the island port. He had to know that the whole town of Smeerensburg was involved in a generations old feud between two families that leads to lots of resentment. Also, I doubt he is that self-efficient. He has a lot of metal works, materials and tools in his workshop that wasn't made from his hands. He had to trade with somebody that wasn't Saami at one time for certain goods. After all his location is on the map. Regardless he still sometime in the past left the village to its own devices and selfishly move to isolate with his wife in the mountains. Because of that, he shouldn't gotta mad at Jesper too. That postman gave his life some new direction and purpose. Regardless the movie does a good job promoting moving past grudges and showing the importance of generosity, compassion, and teamwork. As the saying goes a true selfless act always sparks another. Even if the children are only acting good to get toys. As for the critics who be mad about this film deceiving children into believing falsehoods as it interferes with the development of critical thinking. Surprising for most of the runtime, the movie gives realistic explanations to a lot of the Santa Claus magical lore. Yet the ending gives into the idea that the supernatural might be in played. While the ascending to a higher plane of existence idea was well done for a children's movie. I just don't know if the film would had been stronger if Jesper took the mantle and continue the traditions that he founded with Klaus rather than waiting for his friend or not. Still the ending we got was a lot better than the delete version of them leaving everything for the North Pole. Hate for Jesper to lose everybody he grew to like. Truth be told he has more connection with the town folks rather than Klaus which kinda was a bit lacking. While I did love JK's limited voice acting in this film. The large amount of silence and grunts kinda hurt his character a bit. Schwartzman as Jesper was a little bit better as he added some child-like well balance snarky spoil brat charm with his adlibs. I don't think this would have work with the original chimney cleaner rags to riches plans. As for the mature posh English accent from the 2015 teaser. That's just jarring and doesn't fit with the younger man proving himself story that they were going for. Still the filmmakers made the right choices there along with keeping Norm McDonald as the wise cracking ship captain Mogens and having a real Saami girl Neda Margrethe Labba voiced the very cute Margu. Another thing this movie had going for it was its music. Singer Zara Larsson theme song ""Invisible"" was very uplifting and memorable. While composer Alfonso G. Aguilar score was emotional haunting. It was also easy on the ears. As for the visuals. The film was developed for nearly ten years, all because the studio wanted to create a new form of hand-drawn animation to keep the medium alive in the age of CGI. They got their wish as a paperless software was made that masterfully blend 2D with realistic 3D lightning and shading. The results were very crisped. It works amazing with the dark physical sardonic comedy. No wonder why this movie was nominated for Academy Award in 2020. Overall: I have to say this quirky take on Santa Claus's humble beginnings barely had anything really wrong to go postal about. In the end, it's nearly a total package. A must watch during the holidays.",0,0,0,0,1,0,1
Klaus,"Klaus (2019)' is essentially a demystified 'Santa Claus' origin story and it's as formulaic as you'd, perhaps, expect. It's also just delightful. Its predictability can't prevent it from being good and, boy, is it good. It's an enjoyable, effective and visually striking animation with a kind heart and a gentle spirit. It sidesteps the sloppy sentimentality usually associated with 'Christmas' movies in favour of, essentially, a subtler sort of the same thing. Its 'Christmas spirit' is strong but well-earned, sweet but not sickly. The movie is just a joy, in general. It's fun, fast-paced and aesthetically distinct, brought to life with a beautiful 2D-3D blend. It doesn't feel entirely typical, either, thanks to its endearingly strange setting and relatively well-realised characters.

Klaus,"A demythologized origins story of Santa Claus just in time for Christmas. Finally, a story of how American capitalism and British class fears turned an agrarian seasonal occupation of gorging and reveling into a family-oriented tradition of gift-giving money to retailers in exchange for debt and junky toys and, then, blaming it on a white-bearded guy in the sky made up by Coca-Cola.Oh, wait, that's not what ""Klaus"" is about. Again, a mythologized supposedly-partially-demythologized story full of copious amounts of perniciously recycled, predictable and trite schmaltz. Netflix enters a time-honored Hollywood practice of gift-giving lousy Christmas movies in exchange for our money. From ""Miracle on 34th Street"" (1947) to ""The Santa Clause 3: The Escape Clause"" (2006), we keep receiving these stupid Santa movies. I prefer the simpler past, when ""Santa Claus"" (1898) was a one-minute film made to experiment with photographic multiple exposures. Now, Zara Larsson's mawkish ""Invisible"" music-video montage takes up more time than that in ""Klaus"" and without even an innovative effect.Why movie critics, who by definition one would think are supposed to think critically and to have seen this cinematic emotional blackmail time and again, turn into saps for this seasonal sentimentalism is rather perplexing, though (it holds a 93% certified-fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes as of this posting). I speculate it's for the same reasons that Santa Claus and modern Christmas exist in our imaginations at all--because they're so thoroughly stamped upon and become ingrained in the rituals of modern Western society. Regardless, after the initial set-up of a postman and a woodsman inhabiting a village enraptured in some absurd feud, the rest of the movie is so obviously reverse-engineered from the usual Santa Claus narrative that it writes itself. The humor mostly consists of the postman being emphatic and frantic and trading anachronistic barbs with others, such as the ""snail mail"" line. Even that is preferable to the waterworks manipulation. On the other hand, the animation, including some traditional hand drawing, is pleasant enough, and the pacing isn't too bad.It's interesting, too, that Netflix released ""Klaus,"" as the picture employs largely-antiquated animation in the digital age to mythologize the same snail mail that was the backbone of the company's original DVD-rental business. That, of course, has since changed with Netflix sliding down our chimneys through the seemingly-ethereal streaming. Even the postman sits expectantly in his living-room chair.

Klaus,"It's refreshing that we can still get new Christmas classics. Because I think this film has a fairly hefty chance of ending up as one. Animated by Sergio Pablos and his animation studio, and distributed by Netflix, Klaus is the story of Jesper, a privileged, pampered heir to an enormous postal empire, who ends up being sent to a remote island to run its deserted post office. There he ends up inadvertently starting the myth of Santa.The film is, first of all, absolutely gorgeous. Hand-drawn animation is such a dying art form these days, that it's always a feast for the eyes to see one, but even despite that this would be an eye-popper. Especially how seamlessly the characters blend with the backgrounds, or how soft the lighting can be. Pablos used to work for Disney during their Renaissance and took it up as his goal to take the art form even further. I'd say he one hundred percent succeeded.As for the story, it's nice. Jesper is a bit of a cliché character. A pampered prince forced to work for the first time in his life in a remote village where his heart will finally melt. You've heard this a million times. That being said, the location of Smeerensburg is different enough that it feels kind of new. I also really like the character of Klaus, who's this hulking beast of a lumberjack, who nevertheless speaks rather softly and spends his time making toys. While carrying around an axe big enough to make a Tolkien dwarf proud. Now this is a Santa I can get behind.I like this.

Klaus,"Klaus has all the best elements of Disney, Laika & even some Burton, all rolled into one. It's firmly planted within the tradition of animation (slapstick humor, bouncy score that matches visuals, broad but heartfelt themes) but pushes it into the future. It's so rare nowadays to watch a children's movie that's this original, where you can't immediately tell where it's going or how it's going to get there. A wonderful origin story that honors the importance of legends as much as the truth behind them.",1,0,1,1,0,1,1
Klaus,"A beauty.What a lovely, charming and clever film. 'Klaus' took my interest and then some, I was locked in from the start. It's terrific, with some excellent hand-drawn animation. The cast, led by Jason Schwartzman, do very good jobs, also.I loved seeing it connect all the dots of Santa, Christmas et al. If you think about it, it's actually rather simple but it's done in a smart and pleasant way. The ending is particularly sweet. Away from the heart, it also has humour and the pacing is absolutely spot on.Schwartzman is entertaining as Jesper, with J. K. Simmons doing a very solid job as Klaus. I also enjoyed Joan Cusack as Tammy. The cast are probably down the pecking order of this film's pluses, but that's only due to its other, more noticeable positives.Always pleasing to see a great animated film away from Disney, if only to create important competition for the latter.",1,1,1,0,0,0,1

At the end, after 12 years working with Jesper, Klaus disappear into the wind to accompany his dead wife!

Monster Hunter,"5 out of 5 stars.Monster Hunter is an awesome action monster film and a video game adaptation brought to the big screen. I barely played the game series. But know a little about it. Sure, the game to movie adaptation may have some differences and similarities. Like a character named Artemis (Milla Jovovich) who tries to build her weaponry and armory to fight back against the monsters in that world. Also there are some pretty awesome monsters brought from the games. And a few characters like another group of hunters travelling on a ship. And a fun one thats cat like thats in it for a brief moment.The plot is simple and great for an adaptation. Artemis and her military team mysteriously disappear when they run into a storm that set nearby rune markers. That tranported them to a monstrous world. Where they get hunted. Artemis comes across another hunter (Tony Jaa). Which they bond and become a fighting duo. Trying to cross a desert landscape. Trying to reach a tower which may be a portal back to Artemis world. While she comes across new characters and a couple of deadly monsters.The cast ensemble did great. Milla Jovovich is an awesome actress. And action star. Tony Jaa did a great job as well. Ron Perlman did a good job as another character on that planet.It is an awesome action film. Don't expect a development. Just sit back and enjoy the non stop loud and big action sequences. Director/writer Paul W. S. Anderson did a great job in delivering another video game franchise into a movie. He sure can set up an intense action sequences and never stop. The visual effects and creature design is awesome. The music score by Paul Haslinger did a great job. Making it a fun adventure. I loved Paul Andersons films and his Resident Evil films. He can create an exciting action packed film. Monster Hunter is another step up. It is big, action packed throughout, and does have a cliffhanger ending for a sequel while opening up the doors with the story to where it can go. There is a brief mid credit scene that hints on what is to come.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1
Monster Hunter,"Monster Hunter is yet another weak and bland video game based film from a factory of crapy films made by Paul W,S.

Monster Hunter,"I was expecting this to be a run of the mill awful action film with one note performances, but surprisingly I was entertained, although I'd say not a great film, but in some ways it kind of knows that.
The effects are pretty enjoyable, like almost similar to Jurassic Park. Mila Jovovich and Tony Jaa do play off each other quite well, and both are really at action. Ron Perlman is also good in his supporting role. I never played the game in which this is based, but i'm sure it's every bit has entertaining.",0,0,0,0,0,1,1
Monster Hunter,"I saw ""Monster Hunter"", starring Milla Jovovich-the Resident Evil movies, Dazed and Confused; Tony Jaa-Furious 7, the Ong Bak movies; Meagan Good-Prodigal Son_tv, Saw v and Ron Perlman-Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, the Hellboy movies.
This movie is based on the Capcom video game and is written & directed by Paul W.S. Anderson-he is known for doing the Resident Evil movies and Mortal Kombat, among a few others. He didn't stray far from the plot formula of the Resident Evil movies, using Milla Jovovich fighting monsters-instead of zombies-in a movie that is based on a video game. Having said that, it is still a good and entertaining formula. Milla is the leader of a group of soldiers-Alpha team-that is looking for her missing Bravo teammates. It seems that Bravo just disappeared and Milla soon learns where they went, after Alpha travels through a wormhole that leads to another planet inhabited by giant monsters. Meagan is a fellow soldier in Alpha team. Tony is one of the first humans Milla runs into on the new planet and Ron shows up later. The CGI looks pretty good and the ending is a set up for at least one sequel-depending on how well this one does-so if you enjoyed the Resident Evil movies, you should like this one, too. After the end credits start, there is a scene involving a hooded figure and a cat.

The CatDISLIKES:No Character Development
Don't Be An Extra
Monsters Need More Variety
No Story
Skips Much Of the Impressive Setting they Could have Built
No need For Big Names
Action Scenes a Bit Boring and Lacking Cohesion
The Ending for potential sequelSUMMARY:Like a video game in the hands of the modern day audience seldom want little introduction or slow paced stages to open up with. Fortunately, this movie jumps right into the action, taking little time to really introduce anything before the big bad monsters rear their ugly faces. Upon their appearance, the creatures look like a decent match to the video game counterparts, only with a little more coif to their looks thanks to a bigger budget and screen. The Diablos is big, bulky, and daunting in its task to hunt, while the creepy bugs hiding below hold nightmarish creep levels that those with a phobia may be squirming in their seats. Though not the most realistic looking beasts to ever appear on screen, the movie does a nice job of using movie techniques to help amplify the scenes, with nods to Alien, Jaws, Tremors, and some Japanese samurai movies for film lovers to appreciate in their new uses (like I did). Amidst all this movie magic and creature development, the movie manages to find some breaks to allow humor, often in the form of trying to bridge language gaps, some funny insults, and even some unintentional funny moments that made it into the final cut. The famous cat cook warriors are part of the awesome factor in this movie, and are done well as they cook, intimidate, and show off their teeth at the adventures to come. I had wished for more of their appearance, but hey they have to leave something for the potential next movie. As for the action that was promised some of the fights are fitting of the promise though take that with a grain of salt. Beast vs. man fights had some shining moments, but were often one sided bouts with little atmosphere other than destructive carnage. However, a few fights between humans had the choreography that I absolutely loved to watch and was hoping would be superimposed with the rest of the fights, but again they may be working on that in the near future.Unfortunately the spectacles are pretty much the meat of the movie and even that is being generous. Monster Hunter, much like the games, has little in terms of plot and development of characters, with even Jovovich (the main character) having little in terms of background info, goals, or depth to her ""action"" packed role. Tony jaa's signature hunter look has the spirit of the game, but his interactions and tragic past are summed up in one line, but at least better than much of the included cast in the movie. I can say that if you were a secondary character or extra, you did not get much screen time in this movie, for big names Like T.I, Ron Perlman, and several other well-known actors did little in this movie and were almost pointless to be included. The story is pretty absent as well, with little in the way of significant goals, details, or even lore set up to put a point to the chaotic action that is about to unfold for nearly two hours. As for the fight scenes, while some of them work and have some excitement to it, much of these big budget bloated battles have little in the way of pizazz or suspense, at least for me and my buddy. Quick displays of one sided destruction, often end with a quick fix that ironically moves in slow motion that would make Zack Snyder proud. They lack cohesion, and without any explanation are humorous at how useless modern technology is, but archaic weapons that should be hard to swing can deal more damage. In addition, though the creatures are impressive and certainly feel like the imposing behemoths they are supposed to be, but the variety of the creatures we've seen in the games could have been put out in more style in this New World. The exotic sea dragons, the giant bird and snake like creatures, or even more variety of dragon like monsters were all possible choices that could have roared, torn, and challenged our team in new ways, or you know at least made a good ecosystem. The world of Monster Hunter is a living organism in the games, just as deadly as the creatures that inhabit it, but the director's cut corners on this and led to a small montage of passing overheads and simplistic settings to get the job done. All in all, the movie just really did not put its best foot forward to make the world of Monster Hunter come to life, but rather make a cost saving hybrid that lacked the cohesiveness I was hoping for.Overall, Monster Hunter may not be a game with the deepest story or the most unique flavor of style, but the games certainly have a lot more pizazz than this iteration shows. Movie wise there was some potential in this fast paced feature, with creatures showing potential to be truly marvelous beasts, some nods to classic cinema, and a few good references and jokes. Yet, all the splendor of the monster slaying world is lost in the cuts made for this movie. No impressive environments and ecological systems that feel alive, but static pieces that though deadly are devoid of the same energy the game had. Action scenes are a mixed bag of tricks with little suspense, creativity, or similarities to the fights of the games which is just sad given the mess they made. As for the worst part, it's the story and character usage that is awful, with most being not worth the trouble of including in this movie. From my experience, this movie is best meant for home despite the spectacle that they have created. My scores for this film are:Action/Adventure/Fantasy: 4.0

Monster Hunter,"REVIEW - MONSTER HUNTEREXCLUSIVE!Release date sometime 2021!Based on a video game but the only problem with this is that recently a few films have been made based on video games and these have turned out to be quite bad.Is this as bad?Imagine Starship Troopers, Tremmors and Jurrasic Park on steroids with constant none stop action and you may come close to this.As with many films the release date was put back and has (even before release) has caused controversy because of a Chi Knees joke at the start but....A troop of United Nations soldiers get pulled through a portal onto a distant would ruled by really big monsters, after the troop is killed early in the film a lone surviver with the help of (no spoilers) start to fight back in an attempt to return back through the portal home.Monster movie fans will love this, don't expect a complicated story or deep meaningful dialogue just simply see this for the sheer action from start to finish.Rating 10 out of 10",1,1,0,0,0,1,1
Monster Hunter,"Let's be realistic there are no movies in cinemas. Blockbusters have been delayed for months and the only one out TENET is in my opinion an expensive failure.
Paul W.S. Anderson (the guy behind the Resident Evil movies) decides to release his new video game adaptation on MONSTER HUNTER.
I am not a gaming fan but I really enjoyed the Resident Evil movies; specially the Final Chapter; one of the (or perhaps THE) best in the series.If you expecting gore and terror here you will be disappointed; this is big scale FX movie with some very well made and really terrifying monsters. Some scenes; specially the ones with the arachnids are really scary. Others like the ""DIABLO"" are quite good. The Dragon is fine but resembles to much to Games of Thrones.There is not much story to tell; a group of United Nations force got lost under a storm and transported to another dimensions inhabited but very hungry and very big monsters.The only survivor Milla Jovovich helps the very charismatic Tony Jaa to kill the monsters and escape. By the third act Ron Perlman also shows off and with Jaa still the movie.Milla is not bad (she is the directors other half), but her character is too two dimension. She displays as always her physicals fighting abilities but never get the charisma of Jaa or Perlman.
In term of images; the movie is outstanding (nothing surprising considering what Anderson did with Resident Evil).The as always is open for a follow up which I expect to come.In brief lots of entertainment to relax your mind",1,1,0,1,0,0,1

The Christmas Chronicles,"At the beginning of December, The Guardian newspaper did a top ten list, ranking the Movie Santa Clauses, and the one featured in this Netflix movie ranked number 4. Then I saw the poster on the back of the Radio Times, I was most interested to watch it, directd by Chris Columbus (Home Alone, Mrs. Doubtfire, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, Percy Jackson & the Lightning Thief). Basically, in Lowell, Massachusetts, Christmas has been a treasured time of the year for the Pierce family, until 2018 when father Doug (Oliver Hudson), a firefighter, dies in the line of duty. Mother Claire (Kimberly Williams-Paisley) struggles to hold the family together, oldest child Teddy (Judah Lewis) gets himself in trouble, but youngest child Kate (Darby Camp), who believes in Santa Claus, is determined to keep the Christmas spirit alive. On Christmas Eve 2018, Claire is forced to do some work, leaving Teddy to look after Kate, the little girl is watching old videos of her father, and notices an arm in the background near the Christmas tree. She is sure it is Santa, and wants Teddy's help to prove he exists, capturing him on camera, she blackmails Teddy as she has footage of him stealing a car, together they set traps and set up a camera in the closet where they wait. Kate is woken by a bell ringing and sees Santa in the living room, but he leaves before Teddy can see him, but then they hear movement on the roof, and outside they are amazed to see a sleigh and reindeer floating above them. They see Santa hopping from house to house at high speed going down chimneys delivering presents, Kate decides to climb up into the sleigh, Teddy reluctantly follows. Santa eventually returns, and Kate makes her presence known, startling Santa and the reindeer, causing them to lose control, the teleporter to send them off-course, Santa loses his hate and the presents sack to fall out, and the sleigh crashes. They crash land in Chicago, Illinois, Santa (Kurt Russell) officially introduces himself, he looks different to what they expected, he must get the presents back and delivered before the night is over, or Christmas spirit will be lost, like in the Dark Ages. Without his hat, he has lost his magical high speed and cannot fit into tight spaces, so the children are forced to help him. They go into a bar hoping that patrons will help them, Santa, knowing all names around the world, reminds many of them of their Christmas wishes, but no-one offers to help. So, they steal a 2014 Dodge Challenger, which itself was already stolen by the ex-con bartender on the ""Naughty List Hall of Fame"". Santa builds a makeshift radio to listen to the police frequency, and sure enough they hear a report about the reindeer, but police officers Dave Poveda (Martin Roach) and Mikey Jameson (Lamorne Morris) pull them over for speeding. While Santa is taken to the police station, Kate finds and rides the reindeer through the city, and with Teddy they manage to locate the sack of presents. Kate clinbs inside the bag, she winds up teleported to the North Pole, where she is found by the elves, but being a ""True Believer"" they agree to help her. Teddy is taken, along with the bag, by a gang of thugs, the elves appear from inside before they can do anything naughty, they then work together to repair Santa's damaged sleigh. Meanwhile, in jail, Santa has magically pulled out a bunch of musical instruments for other inmates in the holding cell, they perform musical number ""Santa Claus Is Back in Town"", most of the people are also believers, the unconvinced officer is turned after receiving a call from his partner. Santa is released, and returns to the repaired sleigh, and gets his magical hat back, but he has only one hour to deliver the remaining presents before the morning. The children agree to help him, with the elves they are able to move at faster speed, the final gifts are dropped off with only milliseconds to spare. Santa drops Kate and Teddy back home before their mother returns, he gives Teddy his hat as a memento, showing he didn't really need it, and he leaves exclaiming ""Ho Ho Ho"", which he previously stated he was a myth. Kate is ecstatic that she has recorded many of the night's events on her camcorder, but she finds the tape has been taken, Teddy remarks that Santa would never have allowed her to keep it. When Claire returns, the family find the house decorated like Doug used to, they open presents, Kate gets a skateboard she asked for, and Teddy asked to see his father again, Santa could not give him this, but he gives him a bauble, which he hangs on the tree, he is happy to find to see his father's reflection appear. Back in the North Pole, Santa is updating his book of True Believers, adding Teddy's name to it, Mrs. Claus (Goldie Hawn) remarks about the adventure she is aware he has had, and they decide to watch Kate's video tape together. Russell makes for a fun, freewheeling and more modern Father Christmas, his rock singing scene is the highlight, the cameo from his long-time partner Hawn is cool as well, it is a nice simple story of two kids almost ruining Christmas, joining St. Nick to save it, and many magical and chaotic things happening over the course of one night, the special effects are good, the computerised elves are obviously aiming for lovers of Minions, it makes you laugh enough, and it does get you into the mood for the Christmas, something for all the family, a reasonably fun seasonal comedy adventure. Worth watching!",1,1,1,0,-999,0,1
The Christmas Chronicles,"This is definitely a kids movie, but you can do yourself a favor and watch it if you're an adult. Kurt Russell made me laugh as Santa Claus, he really took on the role and ran with it, more in keeping with the Saint Nicholas character of old and not the Coca Cola version. When he broke out with 'Christmas Time Pretty Baby' in the prison cell, well that just cracked me up. Along with the jailbird chorus girls, they really livened the picture up. I don't know about those elves though, they were a lot like those pesky little creatures in ""Gremlins"", but I know they'd be a hoot for the youngsters. I didn't quite perceive the chemistry between young Kate (Darby Camp) and older brother Teddy (Judah Lewis); they wound up being okay in their roles but I sensed something missing. The story probably could have been helped by a larger role for Goldie Hawn as Mrs. Claus, but I think that's taken care of with the sequel in ""The Christmas Chronicles 2"". Sure would like to see Russell do another take on Elvis, although this wasn't his first time. You can check him out with Kevin Costner in ""3000 Miles to Graceland"", but that's not a Christmas movie. Here he had a two-fer - he did Elvis and spoke Elvish!",1,0,0,-999,1,0,0
The Christmas Chronicles,"Now, initially I had some aversion to sitting down and watching ""The Christmas Chronicles"" even though it was readily available on Netflix for me to watch. Why? Well, it is a Christmas movie, and they have an overwhelming tendency to be so sappy that even pine tress go ""no, I ain't touching that sticky thing"", and also because I didn't really think Kurt Russell would be suited for a Christmas movie.My curiosity got the better of me and I decided to watch in on December 24th, you know, just to get into sappy Christmas mood. And let me tell you, I am really happy that I decided to watch ""The Christmas Chronicles"".Why? Well, first of all, this movie was devoid of the usual Christmas sappy storyline where a girl falls in love and have to traverse hardships and always end up in the arms of the man that is out of reach on Christmas morning. This movie was all fun, all excitement and all Yule tide spirits. I actually will go as far as saying that ""The Christmas Chronicles"" actually have potential to become a Christmas classic - one of the type of Christmas movies that you watch year after year, up alongside ""National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation"".""The Christmas Chronicles"" is definitely a family movie, but it is also a movie that you can enjoy without the family around you, because it caters to a wide array of audience. There is something in the movie for everybody.There is actually a great amount of fun, action and thrills throughout the course of the movie, and you don't feel that the movie ever loses its momentum or becomes slowed down and turning dull. I must admit that I was wholeheartedly entertained from start to end.Now, let's venture on to the role of Santa Claus as portrayed by Kurt Russell. I grew up watching him in action movies, so I didn't really want to embrace him in a role such as this. But I was proven so wrong, because he did this so amazingly well. He was really a nice cast for the role, and he brought his own rugged charm and spirit to the Santa character, and I loved that. So my Christmas hat off for Mr. Russell in his performance in ""The Christmas Chronicles"".The singing and dancing scene was something I initially felt weird about, but oh man that quickly caught on and grew on you. And I ended up loving that scene, because it is full of energy, it is a catchy song, and Kurt Russell delivers the song and dance so well.All in all, ""The Christmas Chronicles"" is a movie that you owe to yourself and your family to sit down, either alone or together, and watch, because it is definitely a fun and wholehearted Christmas movie.This movie definitely helped put some cheer on my day...",1,1,1,-999,1,1,-999

The Christmas Chronicles,"There hasn't really been a new Christmas tradition since Elf. Well, I don't know, your family's traditions may include other films. In our house, we watch National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation (and Black Christmas when the parents go to sleep). Netflix is hoping that this new Santa story will be one you come back to more than a few Christmases from now.Kate and Teddy Pierce aren't expecting a good Christmas. Their father died this year, they've been drifting apart and Teddy has even gotten into stealing cars. Yeah, for a seasonal movie, this movie gets dark super quick.When going through old videos, Kate doesn't just see her parents (the dad is played by Goldie Hawn's son Oliver Hudson and the mom is Kimberly Williams-Paisley from Father of the Bride), but a glimpse of Santa. The plan to catch the spirit of Christmas in the act turns into an adventure where they have to save the holiday.Your mileage may vary as to how much you enjoy this, but I was in the right holiday mood to like it. I really enjoyed how Elvis was such a part of Russell's Santa. After all, Elvis and the actor have been linked throughout their careers. Kurt Russell's first movie was the Elvis starring It Happened at the World's Fair. And the actor really turned heads when he became an adult and played the King in the John Carpenter directed 1979 TV movie Elvis. Since then, Russell was the voice of a young Elvis in Forrest Gump and an Elvis dressing thief in 3000 Miles to Graceland. In this movie, Santa sings the Elvis version of ""Santa Claus is Back in Town"" while he's in jail, accompanied by Steven Van Zandt's Disciples of Soul.There are also some funny inside jokes, as the first name read from the book of naughty and nice, as well as the kid who asks for a snowboard, are both named for Kurt's grandsons Bing and Ryder.As silly as the CGI elves were and as expected as the reveal of Mrs. Claus was, I was in a really forgiving mood and enjoyed their antics. What can I say? It's almost Christmas.Becca would like to add that many of her friends feel uncomfortable finding Santa so hot. She said they should just enjoy how good he looks.",1,1,1,1,-999,1,1
The Christmas Chronicles,"Whilst doing well finding Christmas Horror gems, the only main non-X-Mas Horror I had caught on Netflix was the disappointing El Camino Christmas (2017). Browsing Netflix on Christmas Eve,I stumbled on a fun-looking trailer for their main holiday season offering of the year, which led to me discovering Big Trouble in Little Lapland.View on the film:For his first non-animated project, director Clay Kaytis is joined by Robert Zemeckis's main cinematographer Don Burgess in wrapping up a jolly slick atmosphere of Christmas red splashed all over the screen. Although the Minion- wannabe CGI elves look out of place due to the CGI taking away the warmth more fitting practical effects would have given them, Kaytis does very well matching the traditional X-Mas appearance with off-beat with colourful, Elvis-style music interlude and noisy gadgets used by Santa and the Kids to try and save Christmas.Sneaking Kate and Teddy into Santa's sleigh, the writers send them off on a charmingly funny action adventure, which in a similar fashion to The Santa Clause (1994) pulls the cracker on peoples expectations of St. Nick in funny exchanges over Santa refusing to say Ho Ho Ho, and remember the presents requested from everyone he meets (even when they are adults!) Gifting the message of believing in yourself, the writers hold it from snowing the rest of the movie in by having it mentioned during the most frantic moments of the adventure. Fittingly a family occasion with son Oliver Hudson and partner Goldie Hawn joining, Kurt Russell brings magic to the film with a wonderful take on Santa which keeps the warmth jolly whilst lighting up a sarcastic streak and a welcomed Elvis impression intermission as Santa,Teddy and Kate (played by the sweet Darby Camp and Judah Lewis) start to believe in saving Christmas.",1,1,1,0,0,1,1

Intrigued, she and her sceptical older brother ""Teddy"" (Judah Lewis) set out to prove once and for all what we've always known: of course ""Santa"" is real!! The ensuing escapades are fun and engaging; the dialogue is light-hearted and mischievous, and though it's a wee bit long and it certainly runs to sentiment a little too much towards the end, there are good performances from both the kids and Russell is clearly having fun as he and his elves make merry this Christmas...

Instead of watching Home Alone for the 100th time on Christmas we now have a movie that hopefully will put Home Alone in the closet forever.

Sometimes actors are just meant for certain roles, and I feel like Kurt Russell was born to play Santa Claus.

Sure the idea of Santa being caught in the act on Christmas Eve, then getting grounded by two young children so that, yikes! Christmas itself is at risk isn't original, but it's put over here with lots of seasonal goodwill, style and no little panache so that I predict it will itself become at least a minor Christmas classic in years to come.A big, bluff, larger than life character like Santa naturally requires a big, bluff, larger than life performance and Kurt Russell gives it just that. He looks great with his big white beard in that big red suit and is in his element especially when he rocks up Elvis's ""Santa Claus Is Back In Town"" (in the jailhouse of course) reminding us he got his own big break all those years ago in the biopic of the King ""This Is Elvis"". There's also a pleasing cameo by his own celebrity partner, right at the end, as Santa's long-suffering wife.The two kids caught up in the Christmas rush with old Kris perform creditably too, playing down the cute, schmaltzy sentimentality it would have been so easy to overload on screen while there's a nice grounded turn too by Kimberly Williams as their recently widowed mother, struggling to control her up until then quarrelsome siblings.The special effects are just fine especially Santa's down-the-chimney routine and the airborne shots above Christmas-bedecked Chicago. There's also a car-chase, a cute army of elves and reindeers (go on, name them!), some sharp, topical humour (listen for the ""fake news"" reference), a neat running gag egging Santa to drop his famous catchphrase just once, another about his long-held distaste for his corpulent image on the classic soft drink can and a nice toasted-marshmallow-warm ending which might just have you wiping your eyes to clear away some of that winter frost.Just about my only fault with it would be the flatly anonymous title for the film, surely the more exciting ""Santa Claus Is Back In Town"" would have been more appropriate, but I urge anyone needing a seasonal pick-me-up to watch this one, it's one of the better Christmas gifts you'll get this year.",1,1,1,1,0,1,1
The Christmas Chronicles,"Christmas Chronicles (2018)First, go ahead and watch this with normal joyous holiday cheer. It's fun and Kurt Russell as Santa is just peachy and funny.
But as a more critical or demanding viewer: what a roller coaster! There are parts that are inspired and funny and show the potential for a true classic. And there are parts that are just dumb and dumber, not filler but worse, trying too hard to be funny, lacking the right pace. I found myself perked up by the great moments and groaning in the not so great ones. Too bad!
One problem has to be the two kids, who are cute but lack that extra spark that makes them inhabit the movie.
The story, for all its potential, is kind of mash-up of ideas both homey and mystical. It tries to be everything and do everything. What it does pull off is the basic concept (no spoiler here) of a couple of kids getting in on Santa's delivery system Christmas Eve. Lots and lots of potential there.",1,0,0,0,-999,0,0
The Christmas Chronicles,"The Christmas Chronicles (2018)' is a very classic sort of Christmas caper, the kind of thing that could have been released in the late nineties or early noughties. As such, it's a bit hokey. However, it's also quite enjoyable when it gets going, capable of whisking you along on its adventure seemingly without all that much effort. It takes quite a while before everything settles into place; it's only when Russel's no-qualms Santa comes into play that things really pick up steam. Still, there's a good chunk of the thing that delivers exactly what you want it to. This segment is occasionally chuckle-worthy and charming, held together by genre-defining tropes and a fairly likeable set of leads. It's around the time that it reveals its mischievous, minion-esque elves that things take a turn for the worse, though. The plot stalls almost to a complete stop and revels in some really odd moments - such as a protagonist being kidnapped and threatened with death (not only by his kidnappers but also by a chainsaw-wielding elf). As this is happening, Saint Nick is starring in his own bizarre music number which doesn't really gel with the flick's established tone (especially as it's cut together with the aforementioned scene of threat). Thankfully, the movie pulls itself together before it heads into its finale. It finishes on a satisfying note that wraps everything up with a neat Christmas bow. Overall, the affair is generally entertaining despite its flaws. When it's good, it's actually really good. Still, its issues do have an undeniable impact. They don't ruin the piece, but they knock it down a peg or two. 6/10",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Shingeki no kyojin,"This is the biggest anime series to debut in 2013 in more ways than one! Set in a past where what is left of humanity is forced to live within three protective walls while giants known as Titans roam outside eating anybody they catch. Those inside the walls have grown complacent, taking their safety for granted then one day a giant Titan appears and smashes the outer wall. The others flood in and start killing the fleeing people within.One who gets away is series protagonist Eren Yeager although he sees his mother being devoured and promises that one day he will kill all of the Titans. To that end he enrols in the military along with his adoptive sister Mikasa Ackerman and his best friend Armin Arlert. When they are about to graduate from their training class another giant Titan appears and it looks as though another wall is going to fall. In the ensuing battle many people are killed and shockingly Eren is eaten by a Titan! Something strange then happens; another giant Titan appears but instead of fighting humanity it starts killing other Titans it turns out this giant is Eren! Somehow he has the power to transform into a Titan; some people think he could be used to save humanity but others think he is a danger that must be destroyed.It wasn't long into the season that it became apparent this was going to be the most high profile series of the year. No time was wasting in over-explaining what was going on and we were quickly thrown in to the brutal action. Given that this is a shonen rather than seinen series I was a little surprised at just how brutal it was. There are numerous bloody deaths right from the start which will probably earn it a 15 certificate when it gets its UK DVD release. The way we are thrown into the action got me gripped quickly and each week I looked forward to seeing how the story would develop. The action is animated in a way that gives the impression of constant movement, especially when the characters are swinging between buildings or trees with their steam powered 'maneuver gear'. This makes it exciting. The fairly large cast of characters are worth caring about which gives an emotional hit when ones are killed. If there is a flaw it is that Eren is rather annoying in many of the early episode; constantly angry but achieving little thankfully his character matures somewhat once the real action starts. As the final episode approached it was clear that there would either be a rushed ending or another series the conclusion pointed to the latter which should please the vast majority of fans; I know I'm looking forward to seeing more of this exciting series.These comments are based on watching the series in Japanese with English subtitles.",1,1,1,1,0,1,1
Shingeki no kyojin,"I finally got to watch this properly and honestly, I effing love the theme song! I'm a lot more obsessed with this season's theme song then the other 2 seasons after it.

Glad I got a chance to see this anime, 8/10 i give it!",1,1,1,1,1,1,1

Shingeki no kyojin,"Being someone who actually kind of liked the live action movies, it was simply impossible for me not to like the actual thing. One thing that Attack on Titan has it going for it is the whole mythology behind the main plot. There is a huge base of information layered down so that the actual story to flourish. Plus, the action scenes are enough to keep it interesting till the very ending. Another plus was the fact that some episodes could keep you at the edge of your seat, like when that female titan appeared. You just want to keep watching. To both of them, the soundtrack helped a lot, especially the opening theme, building up the mood for something epic. Finally, the characters were really likable and you couldn't help but sympathise with all of them. And now the negative points. Season one had some boring episodes, but fortunately, season two had just some boring parts here and there. However, season two had less episodes with the main characters, which was kind of annoying. You want to see Eren more than just a few seconds in an episode. But that's just me. Also, the art kind of didn't settle with me. Mikasa looked like the male characters, only with the addition of long hair. But, in the action scenes they did a great job, so at least that worked. Also, the titans got worse in season two, weirder in a way, but that could have been just a story thing. So, overall, 8 out of 10.",1,0,1,1,1,0,0

Shingeki no kyojin,"It's true - every great thing I've ever heard about the Japanese Anime' series ""Attack on Titan"" is true. A friend of mine recommended this series to me a while back, and I finally just got around to watching the first half of the first season on DVD. I can only hope it gets better from here.In the year 845 in the distant future (?), mankind is at war with the Titans, massive humanoid creatures of unknown origin, are of varying size and strength, and who appear to possess very little in the way of intelligence - yet share a ravenous appetite for human flesh. The remnants of human civilization have barricaded themselves behind massive walled cities as their only form of defense against the Titans, who attack at random and seemingly without any thought or purpose.At the beginning of the series, over a hundred years have passed without a major attack from the Titans. But that relative peace is shattered when one day a massive new breed of Titan called a ""Colossal"" smashes through the walls of the southern city of Shinganshina. In Shinganshina, we're introduced to three childhood friends - Eren Jaeger, his adoptive sister Mikasa Ackermann, and their mutual friend Armin Arlert. During the attack, Eren witnesses his mother being devoured by one of the creatures.Two years later (and in using an important plot point bearing similarity to Robert A. Heinlein's ""Starship Troopers""), the three then enlist in the military to help fight in the war against the Titans. By the time they graduate from the military academy in the year 850 and have joined the fight to save humanity, Mikasa proves to be the most physically skilled at killing Titans (who despite their apparent resistance to physical injury and tend to regenerate quickly from whatever wounds they do sustain in battle, do have one weak spot on the back of their neck). Armin is the weakest of the three, yet is later revealed to be an expert battlefield strategist and tactician. And lastly, there's the wild-card of Eren Jaeger, who is soon revealed to have a unique ability that may just help turn the tide of the war against the Titans in favor of humanity.""Attack on Titan"" is adapted from the best-selling, critically acclaimed Japanese Manga series of the same name created by Hajime Isayama and published by Kodansha in Japan. This is one of the most gripping, thrilling, and harrowing Anime' series I've seen in a long while. Perhaps the most credit belongs to series director Tetsuro Araki, who was also behind the superior ""Death Note"" and ""Highschool of the Dead"" (the latter of which I never saw, but have already read the original Manga).""Attack on Titan"" places many different elements into the mix, from horror, to dark fantasy, to the post-apocalyptic thriller, to the futuristic war film. ""Attack on Titan"" is also not an Anime' series for young children. The series is quite gruesome in its depiction of violence - against humans and Titans alike - and there's lots of blood. Yet in spite of what I just wrote, the series is admirably restrained in its depiction of the most graphic carnage - preferring to leave such things to the imagination of the viewer.Some have compared ""Attack on Titan"" as being Japan's equivalent to the American TV horror series ""The Walking Dead"" (which I also adore). I can honestly see some of the comparisons, since both ""Attack on Titan"" and ""The Walking Dead"" possess gripping characters and story-lines. Despite the vastly different subject matter, both series do ultimately depict a bleak future for humanity in the face of certain apocalyptic doom. Yet in spite of it all, in both series there is a faint glimmer of hope, and a case is made for humanity's continued survival (if not to continue to remain the dominant species left on Earth).I can say that ""Attack on Titan"" does have a new fan in this thoroughly impressed viewer. I can't wait to see the second half of season one.10/10P.S.: The opening theme song - ""Guren no Yumiya"" (literally translated from Japanese as ""Crimson Bow And Arrow"")/""Feuerroter Pfeil Und Bogen"" (German spelling) - by Linked Horizon is one of the most thrilling opening songs I've ever heard in a Japanese Anime' series. Too bad it's not used throughout the whole series (my only serious gripe so far)...",1,1,1,1,1,1,1

Shingeki no kyojin,"Attack on Titan, in case you haven't heard, is known for being extremely violent and over-the-top, and I like it that way. But Attack on Titan gets it spot-on. The show isn't really plot based, it's character and action driven. Sure, there is a plot, but it never goes much deeper than: ""Kill the titans and save the world!"" However, it still manages to be interesting and very exciting to watch. The characters are extremely well done. With the exception of some cliché characters (all of whom manage to fit into the universe perfectly), they're all interesting to witness. Why? Despite the lack of casual conversation, every character feels real. This might be because every character has an original and unique design, making them feel real, or because they each manage to distinctly tell the audience who they are and what their like simply by stating a few sentences. When the actual fighting starts, you've barely met the cast and yet you've fallen in love with them. It's clear from the get-go that every character has bonded with the others, making the relationships feel a lot more real right off the bat too. The action is epic. The fights are, although not the most realistic or perhaps effective in terms of titan murder, very intense. But the action doesn't really feel overdone, in fact, it's actually quite realistic (and pretty tame if you ask me). Every character is expendable, and could die at any given moment. When they do die, it's brutal and will make you cry. I almost did every time, but I'm not an emotional person to begin with. Whether you know a character or not, you find you care about them because no one deserves as grisly a death as the ones received. Overall Attack on Titan really is a great show. It's fast-paced and realistic, despite being a fantasy. If you like blood and gore as much as I do, then look no further then Attack on Titan.",1,0,0,1,0,1,1
Shingeki no kyojin,"Any civilization that can construct such gigantic walls, hundreds of miles long, surely possesses the technology to wipe out the titans; unless I missed it, this is never explained. The graphics are striking, especially the action sequences, and you never quite get used to the titans' facial expressions; they look like bored people waiting for a bus, which is all the more discomforting when they casually pop a human being in their mouth. About that FF button: there are long, long sequences of character development dialogue that could have been shortened considerably in order to tighten the storyline; sometimes this development goes on for several episodes in a row. The classic escalating argument/arrive at a conclusion storytelling armature is rather stretched to its practical limits, and repeats itself many times during the course of the show, long after your patience is exhausted. The entire female titan story arc is rather thrilling and suspenseful, and the payoff is worth the investment of time. Eren can't speak without screaming, so I had to turn my volume way down whenever his face pops up. The whole 3d maneuvering device thing was pretty cool. Overall I loved this series, well what I've seen of it so far, and I'll continue watching.",1,0,0,0,0,0,1
Shingeki no kyojin,"Okay, if you want to see a series of the utmost strangeness this is it. A town or village is wrapped up like a cocoon behind a fifty meter wall made of strong cement and concrete. Outside of these walls are individuals who walk around naked one quarter of the height of these walls. What ever they are, they look humanoid, but with an appetite for human flesh. For the past 100 years, the walls have kept the village safe until one fateful day the secretive Titans as they are called appeared to break down the wall so that the walking demons could have their fill. And these titans are higher than the wall itself. Now a boy named Eren, vowed revenge against them for having his mother eaten by one of the demons in front of him while on the run with his friend Mikasa and Hanne. This horrible dream for which the people themselves feared had come true, a reality that not all walls can hold back an enemy no matter the size. Even water drops over a hundred years can break a wall. Now outside of the walls, Eren must become part of the military with very limited weapons to help their cause. But more often than not, the soldiers themselves cannot find out where or when these titans arrived to cause so much despair and terror. This series is not for the feint of heart, it contains a good amount of gore as well as horror scenes which will curl your hair. I have to say this is one for the books, I have seen all sorts of horror but this series looks very, very interesting. I would have to say anyone over eighteen can watch it. Under that age will give kids nightmares. One of the most original series to date. Highly recommended to those who like this genre.",1,0,1,1,0,1,1

Shingeki no kyojin,"I'll admit that I wasn't going to check this show out to begin with. I had been disillusioned with Anime for a good period of time since the early 2010s; I didn't have anything against it but for a while it was all starting to seem the same to me. I guess years of being into Anime can do that to you plus the massive amount of shows you check out. So even the cool costumes I was seeing at conventions weren't enough to persuade me to check the show out, and even the sparkly text and histrionics about this supposedly being the ""Game of Thrones"" of anime could. But a week ago or so, my resistance finally reached a breaking point and I found myself on Netflix scrolling for twenty minutes straight looking for something to watch. After several minutes straight of trying to resist its pretty looking poster, I gave up and began watching it. And to my surprise, my low expectations were immediately exceeded with its gripping opening scene and I had gotten up to 8 episodes that night before heading to bed, finishing the show two days later I'll get the bad things about this show out of the way first, because there are quite a few of them: For one, the pacing is incredibly slow. I realize this isn't anything new in anime and DBZ had been the king of slow pacing, and thankfully it isn't a bother most of the time, but there are moments when its anime-ness begin to shine through- extended imagine spots and entire conversations did get rather frustrating. There are a few episodes that do rely on the characters not knowing what's on the outside of the wall, to the point where it causes the characters to act stupid at times. But then there is also the subplot where Eren becomes a Titan after being swallowed by one, and with a simple gnaw on his hand, can become a titan at will. There are a few situations that could be solved by him becoming a Titan, but he doesn't. In some situations it's effect but in others it's frustrating. And lastly the ending is a bit of a cop-out. I know it had to happen but even still it was somewhat unsatisfying But like any patient viewer I didn't let these spoil the show and just sat back and appreciated it for what it was: a stunning piece of storytelling and visual mastery. For all its flaws, there were enough high points to dull them; be it some rather unexpected twists in the stories or even just the few moments where you can just sit and appreciate the visual beauty. In addition, the action scenes are truly fantastic and well done; it's been ages since there have been action sequences this exciting in anime. It's always a joy watching the gas tanks shoot steam and watching the characters fly at full force of one of the titans to attack it. And the characters; the first time I've felt any attachment of any kind to the characters. Part of them is that none of them are written to be perfect and all have their flaws; there's a sense of moral ambiguity in each and every piece of character development. It was always interesting watching Eren try to balance out the power of being able to become a titan at will and the responsibility that should be exercised; for a major plot point spent on a female titan, he is faced with the choice of becoming a titan killing the other titan, or letting his friends fight. Of course, he realizes the hard way that both decisions have consequences- it's the moments like this that make Attack on Titan a wholly satisfying experience Attack on Titan is flawed no doubt, but bear with it- watching it is a truly rewarding experience. Sure, go for the badass costumes and epic action sequences, but stay for the grand scale storytelling and the visual brilliance. Even despite the flaws, it's clear that Attack On Titan's creators have poured nothing but love into it. It's fun to watch and is very interesting, but it also has parallels to Japanese war history and even throws some unexpected curveballs as a nice bonus. While I'm not sure my enjoyment is enough to have gotten me back into anime as a whole (though that ""Knights of Sidonia"" show does look awesome), I can say that you can count me as a supporter and a fan and while it is a shame we have to wait for a year to see the next season, I'm excited to see where this show goes next",1,0,1,1,0,1,1
Shingeki no kyojin,"Every time it appears something is about to happen - flashback. When it's not a flashback, it's a flashforward.The pacing is slow, the action is mostly closeups of people flying around with their harness contraptions. Good grief, get on with it.

At first I thought it would be overrated and overhyped and people were saying it was good when it wasn't. But it turns out everyone was right this show was great. This anime is very emotional. So if you don't like crying then this might not be for you. There is a lot of action and drama that happens in this story. It went from zero to hundred in no time so they did a great job. The plot wasn't too fast but at the same time it wasn't too slow. So they got the pacing of the story just right. They did great character development for sure. The main girl character and Aaron had a great relationship and their chemistry. I was sad when I thought Aaron had died but it turned out he didn't die so I want happiness when he comes back. It wasn't a totally surprise when he came back he was the main character and as soon as he got eaten I had the thought that he might cut his way out. I mean the way he came back was a little different but he was still back. I wanted to watch each episode and see what was happening. I wanted to know the answer to my question that I had like where was Aaron father? Who was the second Titan human that was in the show? And so on. It is a great show to watch with family. If there would be one thing I would change I would make the theme music that plays at the beginning of the anime to difference but still strong and wartime and angry, sad and all of that. Basically I would change the song to fit the show more. There was a lot of people who tried to change the world and make a difference in there world in the show.",1,1,1,1,0,0,1

With ultra realistic consequences missing from a lot of animation, Attack on Titan stands out as it has an incredibly dark world with actually stakes. The aspects of horror and adrenaline when there's an action scene is stellar. The characters, action and music could carry episodes but don't have to because the show is already that good. Characters have depth and feel like real people, they die constantly and never feel 100% safe. The action is some of the best action in any show. Mystery aspects make even moments that could come off as bland feel so much more impactful. This is perhaps one of the best stories ever written.

I was 7 years old and loved it, but it didn't really get me into anime. I then started watching the Beyblade Metal Saga and liked it, but again, that didn't get me into anime. After seeing alot of youtube videos and hearing people go on and on about this show, I decided to give it a shot. It was the teens react video that got me to watch this show. And right from the opening scene, I knew deep down that this show was going to be amazing and I was right. After watching the first season back in 2014, I decided to check other animes out and give them a watch. These were Naruto, Death Note, Fullmetal Alchimist Brotherhood, Hunter X Hunter, Bleach,, Erased, Cowboy Bebop, Sword Art Online, Durama, Gunslinger Girl, Black Lagoon, My Hero Academia and now just recently, Black Clover. Some of these shows were actually really good. I really liked Erased, Death Note, Full Metal BrotherHood, and Naruto, minus the filler. But after rewatching the Attack on Titan anime in subbed, I was truly shocked to find out that despite all the animes I have seen, Attack on Titan is still the best.Anime Review: Attack on Titan is about humanity being surrounded by large stone walls that keep out titans. However, the largest titan humanity has ever seen has destroyed the walls and all hell breaks lose. The lead character, Eren Jeager vows to kill all the titans after they destroyed his hometown and together with his childhood freinds Armin Arlet and Mikasa Ackerman, join tthe 104th Scouts and eventually the survey corps. WHat this shows does is that it starts off peacefull and normal, having the same tropps from regualr anime and flips it on it's head. The true horror and brutallity these titans cause will give you nightmares. The plot maybe simple, but it is exucuted in a manor that is unthinkabale, in a brilliant way. The shows is possibly the only show I have seen in anime were the supporting cast are just as interesting and likable than the main. All with their own story to tell. The animation and visuals are the best I have seen in anime tv seires. The soundtrack is amazing ans well as the voice acting. I will admit that I did start off this show watching it in english dub, as that was how I always watched anime. But 4 years later, I decided to rewatch the whole show in japanese in time for season 3 and I must say that the original japanese voice acting enhances the Attack on Titan experiance. The english dubbing isn't half bad. I felt like, at first that the english voice worked bette ron the characters than the japoanese voice, particuallty Eran, Armin and Mikasa. But watching it in japanese, throughout, I can saftely say and recommned you watch this show in Japanese with english subtitles. I found out that some lines and dialogue can come accros 'cringy' and 'screechy' in english but it doesn't feel that way in japanese. It feels very natural. But you can decide which is better. Conclusion: I know that this is a very long review, but II could have talked for hours on why you need to watch this show, but I don't want to spoil so much. All I can say without spoiling the show is that "" not all is what it seems to be"". The shows goes in completely different directions that I orignannly thogut that I thought I was going mad. The plot thickens as you get deeper and deeper. After You watch season 1, 2 and the new season 3, read the manga becuase the plot thikens even more and you don't want to be spoiled. Overall, a brutally beautiful anime, with stunning visuals, a stella cast, both japanese and english and has posibly the best soundtrack in an anime, with wondeful editing. I thank the autor and writer of Attack on Titan, Hajime Isayama for writhgn this brutally beautiful series and the director of the anime, Tetsuro Araki for directing this and the onscreen writer, Yasuko Kobayashi for adapting the manga for the small screen and composer, Hiroyuki Sawano for the wondeful soundtrack. Also, thanks to the cast and crew and especially the Wit Studio and Production I.G for animation this wondeful anime. I 100% strongly agree you watch this show. :)",1,1,1,1,1,1,1
Shingeki no kyojin,"I highly recommend this to everyone whose even remotely interested in anime. The story is very interesting, the characters are all well-rounded, the animation is great, and the music is awesome. It's a very bloody show too, so if that's not your cup of tea, don't watch it. The sub is excellent while in dub, it's still great, but season one will take some getting used to, especially if you're used to sub",1,1,1,1,1,1,1
Shingeki no kyojin,"I had such a hard getting through some stuff shown in this show, but at the same time I had such a hard time stopping. It's a fascinating premise with stellar animation, style, and likable characters, the main essence to a great anime.After living a century of peace, humanity is at a war with the titans once again after they breach the very wall that humanity has secluded itself into. After watching his mother being eaten alive by a titan, Eren Jaeger makes it his life's goal to join the Survey Corps along with his friends, Armin and Mikasa, and wipe all titans off the face of the Earth, but Eren becomes humanities unexpected last hope after revealing his ability to become a titan himself, which questions the meaning of humanity and the truth behind the titans.This is a hard watch sometimes. The titans are not only insanely creepy, but watching them mutilate and eat humans alive is really unpleasant, involving multiple torturous deaths. It makes you feel and care for the main characters much more and their determination to set things right, despite being terrified of dying. The themes of the story focus a lot on the will to live, the courage to make sacrifices, and how the fear of humanity is its downfall for not stepping up.The story gets progressively more interesting. We meet our characters, the conflict beings immediately, setting their motive, and we go through all the hell they experience which makes us sad and mad and scared when they are. It gets way more in depth, and season 2 isn't even out, yet the number of questions are endless.All the characters, while experiencing development hiccups here and there, are all very likable characters. Eren is fierce, brutal, and determined, and you hear his thoughts so you know what he's feeling, Arwin is charming, smart, and all around fun, and Mikasa is confident and caring. Them and more are very supportive of each of the character's obstacles.When I first heard this story, it sounded like a background cause that would be the secondary conflict in a bigger story. Titan fighting kind of felt like the sentinels in the Matrix movies, but instead it's the main jolt of the story, it's the whole point, which is truly fascinating.Overall, it's definitely worth checking out, not just because of the amazing story, but the progressive interest in the story. Even better animes like Death Note has slow pacing here and there, but this one gets more and more interesting by the episode. One of my top 5 favorites of all time, and I'm super excited for the second season in 2016.",1,1,1,1,0,0,1

Shingeki no kyojin,"It's pretty bad. At first I just didn't like it but after more episodes I realized it is objectively bad. Almost all the characters are unlikable. The scenes are mostly static, framing almost non-existent, storyline jumbled and out of sequence. Instead of Attack on Titan it should be called ""Talking on Titan"", as it's scene after scene of dialog the sum of which is as original as an 80's sitcom. And the dialog is extremely repetitive. So many characters have similar spoken voices, identical delivery and presentation, similar faces, similar character traits, it's a big bowl of bland mush. Oh and the whining and crying is almost nonstop. Basically this is a show about emotional teenagers expressing their self doubts, self loathing, jealousies, fears, and grief; over and over and over and over and over in nearly static images. There is very little action, maybe 1-2 minutes in each episode.",-1,-999,-1,-1,-999,-1,-1

The horror aspect of the series also works very well, a bunch of zombie giants going around and dealing death to humans in gruesome ways.Some of the subplots are a bit too melodramatic, though, and some doesn't seem to make too much sense, but overall, it just somehow works as a very entertaining anime series.Looking forward to watching season 3 and the last season 4.",1,0,1,1,0,0,1
The Prom,"Self-centered Broadway stars, Dee Dee Allen (Meryl Streep) and Barry Glickman (James Corden), are devastated by their latest review. Barry decides to take on an advocacy issue to raise their profiles. Dee Dee, Barry, Trent Oliver (Andrew Rannells), and chorus girl Angie Dickinson (Nicole Kidman) descend upon Edgewater, Indiana to fight for lesbian teen Emma Nolan (Jo Ellen Pellman) and her right to take her girlfriend to the prom. Tom Hawkins (Keegan-Michael Key) is the supportive principal. Mrs. Greene (Kerry Washington) is the opposing head of the PTA.Liberals from Broadway are the worst. That's how this Ryan Murphy movie starts. They are the most annoying characters. It may work on Broadway as irony but it's off-putting on film. It's meant as a joke but it's utterly unfunny. There is some controversy about Corden playing a gay character. I have a bigger problem with the way he's playing the character. I don't want to hate on the man but I hate his character. He is both too light for the comedy and too self-concerned for the appeal. The turn with his parents is diminished and I don't want him doing this.While I don't hate musicals, it's not my favorite genre. I don't particularly like any of these songs and quite frankly, I don't remember them a few hours afterwards. This movie is way too long at over two hours. Ryan could easily cut out a couple of the songs. I wish that he would cut out the entire Broadway group and hand this story to the kids. I guess that's not the objective.

The Prom,"Having seen this on Broadway three times from different angles to get the full perspective of one of the most original new musicals in quite a while (not based on a movie or a catalog of someone's songs), I was quite delighted that this was quickly chosen to be made into a movie. Not many musicals are filmed within five years of its Broadway run, let alone two.Two years ago, the Macy's Day Parade scored a victory for gay people by showing two young women romantically kiss. The show had an extraordinarily talented ensemble led by Beth Leavel and Brooks Ashmanakas whom I suppose outside of Broadway didn't mean box office.So who to cast? Who else gets to play the top stage roles on film? Why Meryl Streep of course and if she's not exactly in the league of Leavel as a belter, Meryl equals her with a commanding presence and manages to make the egotistical Dee Dee Allen still as big as she was on stage yet show those human elements to make her not a complete monster even in her most self centered moments. Her Dee Dee could easily have been a variation of Madeline Ashton from ""Death Becomes Her"", and there's not one sign of the star of that musical version of ""Sweet Bird of Youth"" present.As for James Corden, he's not among my favorite modern performers, having found Brooks to be completely loveable in everything I've seen him in on stage, but in spite of that found him to be quite a bit more subtle than what I've been lead to believe. He just doesn't have that certain stage bravado that I expected for the role of Barry so it's a slight mismatch for a role that required someone less reserved. His Barry doesn't feel like a big Broadway star who may or may have replaced Nathan Lane in ""The Producers"". He does have a pleasant singing voice, just not Broadway lead quality.While Jo Ellen Pellman, as teenager Emma, certainly can sing and has a nice personality, what she's missing is an edge that someone who's had to defend herself from a bunch of bullies would have. These teenagers, basically nice kids manipulated into being homophobic, are a product of their upbringing, but oh what a lesson that this small town will learn when Streep and Corden arrive in toe with ""Chicago"" chorus girl Nicole Kidman, former sitcom star Andrew Rannels and press agent Kevin Chamberlain.To adapt this to screen, the producers have allowed it to remain nearly 100% faithful to the Broadway show, keeping the score and only making select edits, some for the better. This is still great for everything it is fighting for, whether being acceptance (something that younger generations seem to embrace a bit more) or showing that people can change either through wake-up calls (Barry and Dee Dee), revelations of their own bigotry (Kerry Washington's PTA president) or seeing the world through a bigger light (the young people).In one of the few roles in the show where someone doesn't have a lesson to learn, Keegan-Michael Key is a big ball of heart as the completely accepting principal, aiding Pellman in achieving her desire to go to prom. Flashbacks showing him seeing Dee Dee in her first big show expressed what every Broadway fan feels when that curtain goes up, and that even includes the straight male members of the audience. Kidman and Chamberlain are the others, with Kidman scoring in her big Fosse number. Smaller roles played by Tracey Ullman and Mary Kay Place (not in the stage version) bring on more story perspective.By opening this up to outdoor scenes and sets other than the hotel, the school and the Broadway theaters, this really does indicate the heart that audience members on Broadway saw and brings it to a much larger viewing capacity. This is not for those who hate musicals, or anything that expresses the gooey feeling you get in big brassy numbers on the stage or the rare movie version or anything more accepting out of their own comfort zone. The power of theater rarely transfers over to film, and this one is quite a delight in spite of the magic I felt those three visits to the Longacre Theater and missing Beth and Brooks.",1,1,1,0,1,1,0
The Prom,"I haven't seen a stage production of ""The Prom"", but the movie addresses homophobia as well as the problem of celebrities trying to champion political causes (especially when they don't understand the complexities). The original musical was based on an instance in Mississippi in 2010, when a girl wanted to bring her girlfriend to the prom, and some celebs rallied around her.Like many of Ryan Murphy's productions - think ""Glee"" - this movie is so over-the-top that it defies reality. Nonetheless, I enjoyed every part of it, particularly the scenes where the celebs got a shock at having to adjust to small-town life.

The Prom,"The Prom is a wonderful, bright musical, great to look at, with a marvelous cast, good music, and an old but so often ignored message - the world is for everyone. Everyone deserves to be who they are.However, everybody being who they are does not, in my opinion, extend to acting. Acting is playing someone different from yourself - not in all ways all the time, but certainly in some ways. This is why I can't understand the insistence on casting a gay actor as a gay character, referring to the bad reviews James Corden received. Ridiculous. Grow up. He did a great job. I don't know about anybody else's gay friends, but my gay male friends loved him.If you're sick of hate, and want to feel some optimism about anything (and of this writing, I don't know about anybody else, but I need it) this is the film for you.

The Prom,"Greetings again from the darkness. The success of his TV series ""Glee"" and ""American Horror Story"" has delivered Ryan Murphy the creative freedom to explore other projects. This time out he directs the cinema version of a Tony-nominated musical, and blends star power with newcomers in an extravaganza meant to fill the gap left by the darkened stages of Broadway during the pandemic. Created by Jack Viertel, with a book and screenplay from Bob Martin and Chad Beguelin, it's a story of homophobia and narcissism, and the battle to defeat both.Meryl Streep stars as Dee Dee Allen, and along with James Corden as Barry Glickman, their opening night exuberance for ""Eleanor! The Eleanor Roosevelt Musical"" fades quickly when the reviews hit. Licking their wounds at Sardi's, the two are told by the producer that nobody likes narcissists. Joined by chorus girl Angie Dickinson (played by Nicole Kidman) and Julliard-educated actor/bartender Trent Oliver (Andrew Rannells), they decide what's needed to revamp their careers is a 'cause celebre'. Thanks to Twitter trends, they locate the plight of Emma Nolan (newcomer Jo Ellen Pellman), whose Indiana High School PTA has just voted to cancel prom rather than allow Emma to bring another girl as a date.As you would imagine, becoming an activist for the wrong reasons (publicity) can make things messy. These flamboyant city slickers aren't exactly welcomed with open arms by Midwestern folks. Plenty of touching moments occur between Barry and Emma, Barry and Dee Dee, Angie and Emma, Dee Dee and school Principal Mr. Hawkins (Keegan-Michael Key), and mostly, Emma and her closeted girlfriend Alyssa (Ariana DeBose, who will also star in Steven Spielberg's upcoming remake of WEST SIDE STORY). PTA leader and leading homophobe Mrs. Greene (a fiery Kerry Washington) does a nice job as a bigot and caring parent.So while a story exists and messages are conveyed, this is, more than anything, a glitzy musical covered in primary colors as only Ryan Murphy can. Each of our main players gets a featured song, with Ms. Streep's campy ""Not About Me"" a highlight, along with Ms. Kidman's Fosse-esque ""Zazz"". Mr. Corden probably gets more than his fair share of screen time, while Ms. Pellman and Ms. DeBose shine brightly in their numbers, and both possess lovely voices. Young Ms. Pellman is especially impressive holding her own on screen with Oscar winners Streep and Kidman.There likely aren't many gay teen rom-com musicals set in middle-America, especially ones with a Tina Louise reference, but leave it to Ryan Murphy to make it work. There is some quality humor, though it's likely the song and dance segments are what will draw the audience. Choreographer Casey Nicholaw takes full advantage of the athletic youngsters and fills the screens with backflips and leaps - complimenting the dance moves of the stars. It's a shame inclusivity must still be addressed, but at least it can be battled in a fun and colorful way.

The Prom,"""We have come to show this community that gay people, and gay positive icons such as myself, are made of the same flesh and blood as they are."" Dee Dee Allen (Meryl Streep)Who would have thought: A Netflix musical about lesbians from Indiana? A musical with rousing numbers that fit the book? A-list actors singing and dancing in a Teen musical? A heavy-handed message that works no matter how many times it is repeated?Such is The Prom, an adapted Broadway musical and an unlikely uplift in parlous times, that loudly preaches love trumping all, even homophobes and deranged presidents.Dee Dee, an acclaimed Broadway actress, and her friend, Barry (James Corden), having come off a musical that tanked first night (about Eleanor Roosevelt, no wonder it did), seek a venture that will gain them repute as socially conscious, not narcissistic, as the New York Times claims in its show-breaking review.Angie (Nicole Kidman) discovers on Twitter a senior at a high school in Indiana who is denied going to a prom with her girlfriend. The troupe has found its cause, which they hope will counter the Times' claims and does make them better humans by the end.The film is all about inclusion, the ideal assimilation of lovers of all persuasions into the mainstream, in this case a specific prom. Although songs and dialogue constantly reinforce this idealism, the approach doesn't mitigate the abundance of good will for gay social outcasts like Emily and Alyssa (Ariana DeBose). I was elated that the tolerance motif never seemed bothersome, so highly pervasive it is.Just about everyone can enjoy the new year with this spirited production easy on the eyes and ears:

The Prom,"""The Prom"" begins cleverly enough with the play-within-the-play starring self-righteous, narcissistic hacks. They laughably sing about their power to change the world. After a bad review, they decide to double down and take their supposedly world-changing song-and-dance numbers to saving a lesbian teenager in Indiana. It's amusing enough to see Meryl Streep bursting in on a small Midwestern town's PTA meeting belting out lyrics about how her singing isn't about her. It's a ridiculous caricature of oblivious coastal celebrity elites lecturing bigoted middle America. A FoxNews nightmare--the Broadway/Hollywood liberals coming to corrupt the children's prom. Panic! The movie's message of inclusivity is admirable, too, if heavy-handed and the picture generally overlong. Yet, it turns out, this first act wasn't a joke at all. The rest of the movie is the same obnoxious nonsense as the Eleanor Roosevelt musical. Ryan Murphy and company's featherbrained idealism once again reduce social problems to black-and-white issues to be solved by corny and monotonous speechifying and auto-tune. They are the narcissists.Murphy did the same thing with his prior Netflix project, ""Hollywood,"" bowdlerizing history to pretend that had there been some brave people who spoke up that racism and homophobia would've been conquered in 1940s America. Not only laughably stupid, but insulting to those who really did speak up and those who suffered from bigotry. ""Hollywood"" started off rather well, too, by equating acting to prostitution, but, then, it never really got to the acting part. At least, ""The Prom"" isn't set in the past and any lip syncing isn't as atrocious as in a ""Glee"" episode, although it's instead about the most frivolous thing in the world, proms. According to Murphy, he still thinks he's making an old-fashioned musical film instead of another iteration of ""High School Musical"" (2006)--no, really, he compared ""The Prom"" to ""Singin' in the Rain"" (1952). To the contrary, every song here sounded the same to me; it's awful. Same auto-tuned, singing-and-dancing lecture in unison to the same melody--every time, over and over again. ""Singin' in the Rain"" made fun of the transition from silent films to talkies, but it didn't follow that up with the rest of the movie being as bad as the movies they made fun of. Plus, the singing and dancing was delightful and variegated.Besides reducing discrimination of homosexuals to self-centered fluff, Murphy's formula is also terribly cloying. Pathetic TV, tear-jerker melodramatics. Make sure you give all the main characters a prize at the end and that everybody declares their affection for one another. The bigots, too, learn their lessons. Grab the tissues or barf bags. What a waste of the talents of Streep and Nicole Kidman, among others.",-1,0,-1,-1,0,-1,0

The Prom,"IN BRIEF: Dubious casting and bad direction take some of the fizz out of this effervescent Broadway musical about intolerance and homophobia.JIM'S REVIEW: (MILDLY RECOMMENDED) Critics were decidedly mixed with a love-it-or-hate-it attitude to Ryan Murphy's film adaptation of the Broadway hit, The Prom. I did thoroughly enjoy the live production on stage with its talented cast, good score, and flashy dancing. It was a enchanting romp about intolerance ala Hairspray. And it is hard not to compare these ""then"" and ""now"" versions of the same musical. (Decidedly, Broadway wins!) This movie adaptation is still lively, but it is also heavy-handed and preachy. However, there is still much to enjoy in this diverting movie.The gist of the film is a musical romp that deals with homophobia. A idealistic teenager wants to take her girlfriend to the prom and faces prejudice head-on. Her protests becomes a cause for some out-of-work actors who come to the town to support her cause and gain some needed publicity.Ryan Murphy directs and he does open up his film to avoid theatrical excesses, but he stages his performers in realistic setting that dwarf them and make the musical elements all the more jarring. Add to that, the film's lousy photography and editing that seriously hampers Casey Nicholaw's energetic choreography, with too many close-up and faraway shoots that always cut off the dancing from the knees down. Not the best approach for a musical and Mr. Murphy should know better. (The usually reliable cinematographer Matthew Libatique does his weakest work here and Peggy Tachdjian and Danielle Wang abet his musical crime.) As with the original production, the songs are solid, if not truly memorable, but they do advance the story well.The screenplay by the original Broadway writing team, Chad Beguelin and Bob Martin, remains mostly the same as the play although some dramatic additions to the plot (plus Mr. Murphy. To his credit, the filmmaker does try to bring in some diversity in his casting by giving some Black and Asian actors supporting roles in his film.So let's talk casting. The original Broadway cast soared. It's a shame that Hollywood rarely allows the talented stage performers to reprise their roles. Instead they seek out bigger names to substitute in order to lure moviegoers into the theaters, or nowadays, streaming into your home. And that again is the case here...with decidedly mixed results.The roles played by Tony nominated Beth Leavel, Brooks Ashmanskas, and the talented belter, Caitlin Kinnunen as Emma, the crusading lesbian, were prime examples of Broadway talent enhancing the material. They were all such a delight on stage. Here in moviedom, Mama Streep inherits the showiest role as the narcissistically challenged DeeDee Allen, and she is charming, a close second to Ms. Leavel. The remaining cast members never reach her level of zaniness, although Mr. Conden playing Barry Glickman, the swishy queen diva, comes close. Less than solid support is given by Andrew Rannells as Trent Oliver and Nicole Kidman as Angie. Their second banana comic status proves to be challenging. Newcomer Jo Ellen Pellman is a fine choice as our plucky heroine and Keegan-Michael Key as DeeDee's love interest has a nice chemistry with Ms. Streep. Kerry Washington and Kevin Chamberlin are wasted in their still sketchy and throwaway parts.The Prom loses its ""zazz"" as it hits home its positive message of tolerance. It is high-spirited entertainment, but you might want to sit this one out. Just where are those jazz hands when you need them? (GRADE: C+)",1,-1,0,-1,0,0,0

The film centers on a young gay woman whose not being allowed to fully participate in her prom by the PTA. So some broadway celebrities with bad pr travel to the town to rectify the situation for some supposed selfless headlines. The movie is just a blast of positive energy with great performances by Meryl Streep, Nicole Kidman, Andrew Randall, Michael Keegan, newcomer Jo Ellen Pellman and most surprisingly James Gorden who delivers a wonderful and engaging performance. Directed with creative zest by Ryan Murphy of Glee and American Horror Story. The film features dazzling choreography, a great soundtrack and wonderful musical numbers. I wish I could have seen this in theaters but it's still an amazing cinematic experience. It's funny and sad and it's just the experience we need right now.

You can guess what's coming up from minute one, but that didn't stop me from enjoying it - albeit to a minor degree.Aimee Teegarden (Nova) and Thomas McDonell (Jesse) are a decent enough pairing, while the characters of Danielle Campbell (Simone) and Joe Adler (Rolo) are more interesting than they seemed to be early on. Dean Norris, midway through 'Breaking Bad' at this point in his career, also appears.'Prom' may have absolutely nothing special about it and is very plain, but I'd very much be lying if I said I disliked it to be honest. It's passable.",1,1,1,0,0,1,0
The Prom,"The Prom - C (Mediocre)Too many songs, and sluggish pace and mediocre songs can give you a headache at times. I had to mute multiple times or fast tracked songs especially featuring the young lead actress. She was painful to watch, always gleeful even in more serious situations. You barely think she suffered because she is always super cheerful. Who talks like that, with mouth wide open in a grin all the time. Also forcing her girlfriend to come out of closet relentlessly when she is not ready. I bet in Real life Emma there must be heartening story but unfortunately in this Emma they're unable to find it. I was very disconnected to her motives because she wants a prom dance she should have it eventhough her girlfriend is not ready for big comeout infront of whole school, friends and her mom. Not sure why almost 25+ And 30 years old girls are playing teenagers.Meryl Streep and Nicole Kidman made it possible for me to push through this mediocre songs's bonanza. Soo many songs after songs after songs and sung even more painfully by character actors. Also the whole controversy about James Corden playing a homosexual is ridiculous, isn't for years str8 actors Sean Pean, Hilary Swank, Joseph Gordon Levitt, Laura Dern, Felicity Hoffman and Jared Leto etc broke the bearers and made ways for LGBTQ+ Characters to get mainstream attention and respect. An actor should be able to play anything even a tree as Scarlet Johansson once said.Why actors personal life and preference matters, lot of actors don't want their personal life in limelight. So, it means they should not even audition for these roles because they are not bold enough to comeout of closet. This shows the narrow mindset of current Cancel Culture, we have a bold mediocre maybe but still a movie like that and instead they pick on why they cast James Corden in it. World is truly becoming a toxic place for artists where they're getting judged with whom they sleep with rather than their craft.",-1,-1,-999,0,-1,0,-1

The Prom,"It takes a while to get used to the style of the film and the characters but if you take that time its worth it. At the beginning it all appears a bit irritating, cartoonish and fast spirited. But the more we get to know the characters and their conflicts the more interesting it gets,
I am also always a bit divided on Ryan Murphy. As a creator and creative mind I love him, as a director he rarely meets my expectations of good quality direction. This is no difference. The actors however make up for this. Meryl Streep is really good and developes her character quite well but you wouldn't expect less. Its not an Oscar worthy performance but I am sure she will become a Golden Globe front runner once again. James Corden is really annoying at first but also developes his character so well that he ends up giving a really good performance. Nicole Kidman is rather wasted. She has her Roxie Hart moment but other than that sadly rather forgettable. The young girl who gave her debut performance Jo Ellen Pellman is very good and so is Ariana DeBose. Kerry Washington was very stereotyped and never got out of this. Keegan-Michael Key is very smyphatic. Most of the songs were very good, the chereopgraphies mix between amateurish and very professional and entertaining. The look was nice. All in all a good light entertainment film with a strong message. Worth for the cast. Always nice to hear Meryl Streep singing.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1
The Prom,"Considering some of the bad reviews this received from professional critics and knowing Hollywood doesn't know how to make musicals anymore, I expected this to bomb.

While it does drag a bit during the non-musical segments and is extremely cliché, there are no surprises, it completely soars during the many musical numbers and the songs themselves are for the most part pretty great. There was only 1 song I didn't like and I think many people are going to want the soundtrack. Everyone sounds fantastic. All the big stars in this were wonderful although I felt the standouts were Streep, Rannells and Kidman in her one big number with Jo Ellen Pellman. Plenty of singing, Plenty of dancing, big production numbers, this was a joy to watch and Ryan Murphy really deserves a round of applause for how well he handled and filmed this.",1,1,1,0,1,1,1
The Prom,"I must've teared up a dozen times during The Prom, but when Kerry Washington enters the finale, I literally sobbed - ugly, audible crying. I can fully endorse this movie for its energy, cleverness, and talent. It's better than I was expecting.Meryl Streep blew me away. I was expecting her to be great, but never expected the depth & commitment. Of course I loved the heck out of Nicole Kidman, too. Kerry Washington was excellent in her playing against type, again more effective than I expected. JoEllen Pellman couldn't have been better as Emma.I've seen a lot of criticism for the cinematography, and call me tacky idc, I love the use of lighting and some of the framing. Also the way the original song is featured at the end is cute.My two issues with it: 1) offensive casting aside, Corden is plainly bad in the role; 2) the overly perfected Murphyesque ensemble numbers feel more wooden at times than everything else which is infused with heart and emotion.A strong 8 for me.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1
The Prom,"My Review
The Prom- my rating 8/10
The Prom is a joyous celebration of music and choreography with a strong message that shows the trauma and rejection many LGBTQI youngsters in school go through because of prejudice and ignorance .
Sound a bit bleak and heavy ? Well it's the opposite it's bright and colourful and overflowing with some of the best talent on screen today.
Film Musicals often get a tough time from the critics just look how they blasted ""Cats"" last year and that also featured great talent including James Corden who is quite brilliant in ""The Prom.""
I've already read some very negative reviews saying things like describing The Prom as Ryan Murphy's inconsistent musical and criticism of James Corden a straight actor cast as a flamboyant gay man .
I'm a lover of musicals and have been all my life and I appreciate an enjoyable entertaining musical when I see one.
The Prom as you may have read is loosely based on a true story
Perhaps the most notable incident took place in 2010, when the Itawamba Agricultural High School in Fulton, Miss., refused to let high school senior Constance McMillen and her girlfriend attend the prom as a couple. ... In response, the ACLU filed a lawsuit against the school district.
The original stage musical The Prom made its world premiere at the Alliance Theatre in Atlanta, Georgia in 2016 and premiered on Broadway at the Longacre Theatre in October 2018.
It was a critical and audience success and won The Drama Desk Award for Outstanding musical.
Frank Rizzo, writing for Variety wrote that ""with a tuneful score, a playful book, and performances that remind you what Broadway heart and chutzpah are all about, this cause celebre of a show turns out to be a joyous, funny, and sweet production that should appeal to several generations of musical fans.""
I haven't seen the Stage version but I agree 100% with Frank Rizzo's comments.
The plot is simple basically it's about a troupe of hilariously self-obsessed theater stars who swarm into a small conservative Indiana town in support of a high school girl who wants to take her girlfriend to the prom.
What a great cast in the film as these troupe of actors who's careers are starting to fade . They converge on Edgewater High to help Emma Nolan in a bid for good publicity to help their careers.
Meryl Streep as Dee Dee Allen a narcissistic and egotistical star is brilliant , her showstopper ""It's Not About Me"" is a vampy hymn about ego disguised as humility.
Then we have her co star on stage James Corden who I really admire in this performance as actor singer dancer in The Prom .James Corden is a true musical performer as he proved in ""Into the Woods.""
Nicole Kidman is also wonderful as Fosse Girl Angie Dickinson she has a great number in that Fosse style channeling the late Original star of Chicago Gwen Verdon.
Andrew Rannells as Trent Oliver faded young Soapey star is also good fun .
The star that impressed me most in The Prom is 24 year old Jo Ellen Pellman as Emma Nolan the young woman who wants to take her girl to The Prom.
I've seen Jo Ellen before in The Marvelous Mrs Maisel but in The Prom she reminds me of a cross between a young Anne Hathaway and Elisabeth Moss , my prediction is that we are going to see much more of JoEllen Pellman.
Summing up The Prom I'll just say if you don't like musicals you probably won't like The Prom but watch it anyway just for the message of acceptance and open mindedness and the talent .
It has some very good songs by composer Matthew Sklar and David Klotz and great dance numbers . If you enjoyed the series Glee which Ryan Murphy the Director of The Prom wrote you'll enjoy this movie.
I hope I get to see it where it should be seen on a giant cinema screen.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1
The Prom,"Charming, glitzy and filled with heart; ""The Prom"" will have fans of musicals in the palm of its jazz hands.In this musical comedy, a troupe of hilariously self-obsessed theater stars swarm into a small conservative Indiana town in support of a high school girl who wants to take her girlfriend to the prom.OK, yes, ""The Prom"" is cheesy af BUT it's entertaining and filled with great performances and musical numbers. Jo Ellen Pellman delivers a break out debut performance that will leave you inspired and feeling good. Streep, Kidman and even James Corden are respectively grand in their roles. Along with Pellman, Andrew Rannells delivers the next great performance, with his scenes literally jumping off the screen. I believe what filmmaker Ryan Murphy is trying to do in this day and age is give us stories with underdog characters that we can all relate to, and it works.

Jingle Jangle: A Christmas Journey,Jingle Jangle is Netflix's foray into the Christmas musical market.Forest Whitaker is the grumpy inventor Jeronicus Jangle. Many years ago he was the greatest toy inventor. Then his young apprentice Gustafson egged on by a villainous toy stole his his various designs and became famous and wealthy.Now Jeronicus is heavily in debt and has lacked a creative spark for many years. When his estranged granddaughter visits him he is coaxed back and inspired to work in his latest creation. A talking robot.This is an engaging film but let down by forgettable songs. It needed a big show stopping number. The kids might find the songs a tad dull and also the movie is overlong. The colourful production values are very good and almost Disneyesque.It does borrow heavily from other movies. The Princess Bride in the way it is framed as a grandmother tells a story.

Mostly. Without giving away too much, some scenes are just over the top to portray a person as a caring individual and it detracts from the scenes and they could have been done them many other ways with a better result.In any case, it's a good enough show with great dynamic actors who will most likely get better as the series progresses.",-1,1,0,-1,0,1,-1

While watching the first episode I cannot help but noticing so many holes and inconsistencies in the story that make it hard to get immersed into it. You really have to suspend your intelligence most of the time. Examples:
Why would the only teenage son of a reputable judge in modern day America drive such old lemon of a car? Would a teenager who can hardly breathe while having an asthma attack really attempt mouth to mouth resuscitation on the bloody mouth of the person he just hit? When the judge goes into the police precinct to deliver his son at night, he gets in there at the exact same time as the parents of the victim are leaving said precinct for an accident that happened in the morning. Really? That same night when the parents visit the scene of the crime they find the inhaler of the perpetrator in plain sight on the floor. A scene like that would have had forensic experts and an army of law enforcement putting the place through a fine tooth comb and that inhaler would have been exhibit #1.
The judge who seems to be an intelligent man tries to clean his sons car quickly with a simple rag, in the days of DNA evidence. Really? Him of all people should know better. Then when he pretends to urinate on the bridge, the cop should have seen flashlight in hand that there was no urine at that spot. Anyway, the acting is good and the story keeps you engaged so I'll push on through but this is definitely not a 10 star show as far as I'm concerned. This is not Breaking Bad level. To keep it in context BB was over the top but that was the style of the show. This one is meant to be a more somber drama but in that context it leaks all over the place.",-1,1,-1,0,0,0,-1
Your Honor,"It is not believable that a judge's son would be driving that car, not due to its age, but, clearly it is not a car in working order. There is another car, yet he picks the one he must know is not running well.
There are just too many poorly done and not even believable coincidences. To me the home looks dark and shabby, the filming looks bleak and off. The mouth to mouth scene is really not credible in a pandemic or otherwise, it is just not done anymore. It was also graphically disgusting. He could have just turned the kids head to the side, he was choking on his own blood.
The bridge scene is also one of multiple ""Are you kidding me?"" moments , whether he actually urinated or not. He is out in the open dumping evidence. He is public figure and one who how should know how to clean up a crime scene. Since he is making up so many stupid excuses, he can't find one for his son who could have severe internal bleeding? Did he even notice?
Vince Gilligan should get some credit for the stolen Breaking Bad elements. Cranston was great there, but have you noticed this seems to be his entire range of acting skill?? Walter White as a judge.He does this weird thing with his jaw and tongue in just about about every single thing he is in. It is creepy, worked in Breaking Bad. No place else, saw him do it in the movie The Lincoln Lawyer... No even sure what he is trying to convey, the universal sociopathic mouth gesture??
Yes, Breaking Bad was the role of a Lifetime, he was awesome. He should choose his parts more carefully.
Many I think are rating him and his ""gravitas"" which is fading with every episode of this show.Episode 2 was horrible,
and made me change from a 3 to a 1
Just so depressing and the filming is bleak and weird. What was done and is being done to the poor black kid, I had to shut it off mid-way. Like others have said

Promising Young Woman,"Greetings again from the darkness. ""Revenge is a dish best served cold."" The protagonist in writer-director Emerald Fennell's (""Killing Eve"") feature film debut is a woman on a mission to avenge not just what happened to her friend, but also change the mentality of predatory men ... one ""nice guy"" at a time. She is a #MeToo heat-seeking missile.Carey Mulligan stars as Cassie, and when we first see her, she appears to be nearing blackout mode while drinking alone on a bench inside a bar. Most people have hobbies like crochet or golf. Cassie's hobby, or maybe mission is a better word, is to lure men, with the appearance of a drunken easy score, and then scare them straight into respecting boundaries. She's a non-violent vigilante (as opposed to Beatrix Kiddo) for morality and respect towards women.As the film progresses, we pick up bits about what traumatized her to this extent. It turns out her best friend Nina was victimized by a group of men from their law school class. See, Cassie is the titular 'promising young woman' whose career dreams were dashed over what happened to her friend. Now, Cassie works in a coffee shop with a supportive and wise-cracking friend Gail (Laverne Cox, ""Orange is the New Black""), who knows nothing of Cassie's hobby ... and neither do Cassie's parents (Jennifer Coolidge, Clancy Brown) who can't help but wonder what happened to their bright, ambitious daughter, and why she still lives at home with them.Cassie's mission gets momentarily de-railed when former classmate Ryan (an excellent Bo Burnham, THE BIG SICK) pops in to the coffee shop and awkwardly proclaims his long-time distant crush on her. The two are clumsy and believable together, and their relationship has more ups and downs than a pogo stick. For most movies, this would be enough to hold our attention, but not for ambitious filmmaker Fennell who has much more to offer. There is a cleverness to the presentation with four specific segments: a friend who didn't believe her (Alison Brie), the law school dean who didn't want to ruin a boy's future (Connie Britton), a regretful defense attorney who took the money (Alfred Molina), and a bachelor party that gathers those who make up her nightmare.Ms. Fennell is also an actor (and has a cameo in this one), and it's clear she has a real feel for putting actors in the best position to maximize a scene. Of course, Ms. Mulligan is an outstanding actor on her own, but the actors benefit from Ms. Fennell's work. Other supporting work is provided by Adam Brody, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Molly Shannon, Chris Lowell, and Sam Richardson. The color palette is similar to an early Tim Burton movie, and in fact, Cassie's home looks like a museum or possibly a middle-class Liberace setting.There is a lot going on here, and some of it is quite uncomfortable - and sprinkled with dark humor in unexpected moments. Advice like ""move on"" and excuses like ""we were kids"" ring hollow to Cassie, who carries some guilt over what happened to Nina, and remains focused on attacking a system that enables inexcusable behavior. Ms. Mulligan embraces a character who possesses raw nerves and emotions she sometimes hides, while other times flashes in neon. This isn't about a guy here or there who takes advantage, but rather a faulty system that protects these guys at the expense of victims. The ending is unusual and unexpected, and kudos to an exciting new filmmaker.

Promising Young Woman,"This much-above-average thriller generated lots of heat for Fennell and Mulligan. The former for a production which had Hitchcockian elements not seen since ... well .. Hitchcock. And the latter (Mulligan, OLDER playing YOUNGER) for one of the greatest screen transformations since Hugh Laurie abandoned his accent and morphed into House. The irony is that the film itself is uneven, and moves in fits and starts. Mulligan on the other hand basically carries (bad pun) the production to the finish line on pure, raw, talent. Is this the same woman who does those dry police procedurals in the UK? If there is any justice -- itself an open-ended question -- this will give Mulligan's career the boost it muchly deserves.",1,1,1,1,0,1,1

Promising Young Woman,"""Promising Young Woman"" (2020 release; 113 min. brings the story of Cassie. As the movie opens, Cassie is slomped over in a bar, very drunk. It's not long before a guy comes over to check on her, and volunteers to drive her home. Except that instead he stops at his place, where, just as he is about to rape her, Cassie snaps out of it, not drunk at all. Cassie notes this latest 'incident' in her little diary. We then get to know Cassie: almost 30 years old, she still lives with her parents, and she holds a job at a coffee shop after having dropped out from medical school some years ago, along with her classmate and friend Nina... At this point we are 15 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the writing and directing debut of British actress Emerald Fennell, who pitched this story to Margot Robbie's production company. And what a debut it is. The timing of this movie couldn't be better in the age of #MeToo and all that comes with it. Remember the confirmation hearings of Supreme Court Justice Kavanaugh... The mobie is plot-heaving so I really don't want to go into further details. Of course none of this would have had the impact without the stellar performance by Carey Mulligan. I am going on record already that Mulligan is a shoo-in to get a Best Actress Oscar Nomination (and may indeed win the Oscar). I don't see how Emeral Fennell could be denied a Best Original Screenplay Oscar Nomination. The screenplay is original, funny, serious, and more.""Promising Young Man"" premiered exactly 10 months ago today at the 2020 Sundance Film Festical, in what seems like a difference century altogether. It was originally scheduled to opne in theaters in April, but a little thing call COVID-19 had different ideas. The movie finally opened on Christmas Day, and I couldn't wait to see it.

Meanwhile if you are in the mood for a hard-hitting social commentary served up wuth black humor and a thrilling performance by Carey Mulligan, I'd suggest you wun, don't walk, to your nearest theater, or eventually seek it out on VOD or DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Carey plays a woman that dropped out of high school because of an incident that happened to her best friend. Carey was going to be a doctor before she dropped out of school and now works at a coffee shop with Laverne. Carey is now 30, and she still lives at home with her parents-Jennifer Coolidge & Clancy Brown in cameos. Bo plays Carey's confused boyfriend-she won't even let him kiss her-and Chris is one of the boys that caused the incident in the past that messed up Carey's life. When Carey hears about Chris being in town-getting married-well, it just starts the old vengeance motors to start turning in her head and plans start to take form. There are lots of other cameos that pop up; I remember seeing Connie Britton, Alison Brie, Adam Brody, Max Greenfield, Molly Shannon, Christopher Mintz_Plasse and Alfred Molina.
It's rated ""R"" for violence, language, drug use and sexual content-no nudity but sexual assaults are shown-and has a running time of 1 hour & 53 minutes.
I really enjoyed it and would buy it on Blu_Ray.",1,1,1,1,0,1,0
Promising Young Woman,"This recent release will surely be the talk of the town for some time to come (let's see if it'll garner some Oscar buzz as well) as we explore the revenge laden journey of a former medical student (who now lives at home w/her parents) as she habitually pretends to be drunk at night clubs, gets picked up by a suitor hoping for a hook-up, only to be put in their place when she reveals all her faculties are still there, primarily her acid wit & forthrightness, which deescalates the situation. Carey Mulligan (already an Oscar nominee for her performance in An Education) will surely cop a nom here (maybe a win too, mark my words!) is our anti-heroine, laser focused in her goal (which will gain clarity as the film progresses) in taking down these various bargain basement Lotharios (Christopher Mintz-Plasse, McLovin' himself, is one of his victims, Adam Brody is another) w/her co-worker (Laverne Cox) & parents (Clancy Brown & Jennifer Coolidge) worried that life is passing her by. Into said life comes an old medical school student friend, played by Bo Burnham, who may shake her from her mission but when Mulligan's raison d'etre reveals itself (a past school mate was raped by students & then subsequently committed suicide when the crime was not punished) we see where the eye of her particular hurricane stems from. Not a film which will be embraced by bros, incells or the like but not since Linda Fiorentino's turn in The Last Seduction has a thoroughly unlikable misanthrope garnered enough audience sympathy for her cause rooting her to win at all costs...& what a cost it is (you'll have to see it for yourself friends & neighbors!). Also starring Molly Shannon as the lost girl's mother, Connie Britton as the school dean where the incident took place, Alfred Molina as the attorney who handled the case, Alison Brie as an old friend of Mulligan's w/a mini Veronica Mars reunion, Chris Lowell & Max Greenfield, popping up as the purveyors of the foul deed.",1,1,0,1,0,1,0
Promising Young Woman,"REVIEW - PROMISING YOUNG WOMANMen can be scum especially those who prey on drunk women and basically this is the entire premise for the film.A women pretends to be drunk so she is taken home by a good semariton but the guy has other things on his mind, basically taking advantage of her while she is drunk but the story then delves into why she doing this and how she seeks revenge for a friend of hers.Great film and quite disturbing at times to see how men are / can be around women but especially good is how the entire story develops.Great film, great watch and definitely one to see.Rating 10 out of 10",1,1,1,1,-999,1,1
Promising Young Woman,"Its stark tonal shifts and uneven plot structure might be distracting at times, but Emerald Fennell's 'Promising Young Woman' consistently offers a powerful portrayal of rape culture and sexual assault with a narrative full of surprises. Carey Mulligan shines as the lady nightmare dressed like a daydream, constantly challenging the audience to rethink their perceptions of the character. Her performance is devilishly delightful to watch.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1
Promising Young Woman,"Wow !! I do really mean wow. I personally don't say that often after a film but ""Promising Young Woman"" definitely left my jaw dropped. This is the sort of film that is 100% needed in our times whether you like it or not. Even more sad is the fact that I feel this might be divisive, it shouldn't be, instead it should be commended for its brutal honesty about really really dark subject matter.Lets deal with that first, the subject matter of the film which more or less covers sexual abuse. This film delves deep into how young men take advantage of young women in such a simple and honest view. It is written so well that this film isn't banging you over the head with a feeling of pity but with a strong message of people should be waking up to reality. It is 100% not lecturing on just why men are all bad (although yes a lot of us are) it looks at both men and women's reaction to this topic, its a societal problem. Some fantastic scenes involving Carey Mulligan and Alison Brie. Be warned this film is dark and then you think it cant any darker the final act is just.......*insert chef's kiss*......I don't know how else to describe it. I thought it was bold, shocking, totally unexpected that this film had a dark ending. So pleased it did because it served the characters extremely well.Other positives. I would say the this might be the best film I've seen Carey Mulligan in. Its not so much that the character demands a lot, its just a real breath of fresh air to see her do something very different. She carried the film from start to finish and you, as an audience member, become very attached to her very quickly. I really hope this is the start of her doing more out going roles because in years past I've always thought she was a safe actor. Mulligan has always been solid but I've never seen her challenge herself, until now.I do have one problem with the film and although after seeing the ending it isn't as annoying in retrospect. There is an attempt to build a romance between the lead character and one of her old school friends. For between 10-15 minutes the film almost completely changes into this romantic/comedy which really really didn't work. It was almost like a completely new director and writer had been allowed to shoot a scene in the film. It stuck out to.......something about it didn't fit. Thankfully though it turns out the ""old school friend"" wasn't as good as he seemed. A sheep in wolves clothing. I'd say thats a big part of the film, trying to challenge you of what ""being a good guy"" actually means. All us guys think it but we need to look in the mirror and actually prove we are.Overall I surprisingly really enjoyed it especially the ending..........please please wait until that last 30 minutes because it is the best part of the film. Carey Mulligan was terrific in the role as Cassie, to be honest I think the film was cast really well overall. As I've mentioned before though in the divisive/tribal times we live in, I think people might just label this film without giving it a chance to example itself. It has a brutally honest message about something extremely horrible and real. We all need to listen. 70% out of 100%, I'd definitely recommend it.",1,1,0,0,1,1,0
Promising Young Woman,"This film is an indie dark comedy/thriller about a young medical school dropout, Cassie, who seeks revenge on men by trying to lure them, only to put them in their place. Shaped by past traumas as well as the experiences of her friend, she feels the need to be heard and understood. While the concept of the film could have been utilized very well to create a clear parable for the #MeToo era, the film feels tonally erratic. The screenplay does mix some engaging dark humor with social commentary, but I didn't find the characters to be particularly unique or interesting in terms of their development. The static nature of some of the characters further makes the plot less engaging, and some of the attempts at ""revenge"" ultimately get a bit repetitive.The story does clearly show the moral repulsion of sexual violence, as well as the tragic psychological toll it takes on survivors. Yet the attempts at twisted humor often fall flat, and sometimes feel rather tone-deaf given some of the seriousness of the rest of the material. The film's quirky aesthetic also did not do too much for me. Its visual and musical style could be defined as ""candy-colored,"" and the pop music in the soundtrack can sometimes be a bit off-putting. While I admire the audacity of the director, I think the jarring tone and aesthetics don't always feel conducive to the much more tragic and grounded social themes embedded in the story. The ending also seemed to negate the film's tone from both a thematic and moral level, and leaves far more questions than answers (but not in a good/ambiguous way.) I wish I could say I really admired this given the strong reviews it got out of Sundance, especially given the talented cast and Margot Robbie's production company producing, but I cannot. Not recommended. 5/10",-1,1,0,-1,0,1,0

#CareyMulligan plays Cassandra, A woman seeking revenge for an incident that happened to her friend in high school. Mulligan's performance is absolutely memorising and sets a dark tone for the movie, considering its vibrant candy-like palette. #BoBurnham's performance is absolutely hilarious and will 💯% make you laugh.
🍬
The films plot and theme reflects extremely relevant real-life issues regarding the #MeToo movement. It's overall premise is very convincing and Jaw-Dropping in parts. Real-life issues depicted in this film reflect on Mulligans character regarding, her desire to get revenge (And does it in the best way possible)
🍬
Overall, Promising Young Woman is a very important movie for many people to see and will ignite lots of conversations upon its initial release (December 25 - January 14). The movie shows director #EmeraldFennell as a talented up and coming Director.

Promising Young Woman,"If you're looking for a revenge thriller revolving around the politics of sexual assault, do not watch this film.It is wild that this is being marketed as a powerful film for victims who have been wronged by a lack of justice in the justice system, as after a certain point in the film it makes it very clear that it believes victims can only be of use by continuing to be victims.To be fair, if all of the budget in marketing and the title of the film weren't clearly trying to make a 'statement' based on real world events, this would be a fine cheap horror film. However, if a film wants to be taken seriously as a piece of art and culture, it needs to rise to the occasion or be found wanting.",-1,0,-1,-1,0,-1,-1
Promising Young Woman,When a movie ignites a valid conversation that needs more attention in today's climate it deserves to be regarded by everyone. Promising Young Woman does this fantastically.What's great about Promising Young Woman is that it doesn't vilify men as a gender purely because they're men. Like so many other films have done before.Please don't let this films overall review deter you from seeing a film fanatic film that ignites a powerful conversation that needs to be heard today.I would've given it a 10/10 if not for Bo Burnham (Although I love him!) and some of the other casts transparent acting. You can tell he's a comedian and not an actor. While I wouldn't be surprised if that was the directors decision to have some of the characters seem paper thin I would've hoped for more depth with Bo''s character and found that if the role was acted better it would've brought more power to his climax.,-1,0,-1,-1,0,-1,-1
Promising Young Woman,I was really excited to see this movie from what the trailer had shown but turned out to be a disappointment.Main character Cassie (Carey Mulligan) didn't get her revenge for her best friend.

Promising Young Woman,"This film definitely did not have the ending that everyone is expecting. It's not the type of ending you'd expect in any film about assault, rape, murder, etc. This movie was made to be entertaining but also very BLUNT to get an important message across. When you see this in theaters, you'll leave with a sense of disappointment in the ending (but not with the film).The disappointment in the ending however, directly correlates to the thought of ""I wish that would've ended differently"" that crosses through victims' minds after being raped or assaulted. Going home drunk with ""a guy from the bar"" or even being alone with a longtime friend shouldn't result in rape or being taken advantage of - but often does. The thought of ""i wish that would've ended differently"" definitely echos in that same sentiment.Promising Young Woman challenges the idea of what a ""good guy"" actually is. PYW attacks the idea of there being a ""gray area"" in regards to placing someone at fault.The cinematography is beautiful and purposeful. Carey Mulligan, Bo Burnham, Alison Brie, & Laverne Cox all did an excellent job at acting through such important roles. This movie is triggering, healing, and educational.

Schitt's Creek,"Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara have co-starred in a couple of Christopher Guest's mockumentaries, always doing a great job. They now get to star on a TV series. ""Schitt's Creek"" casts them as a rich couple (with Dan Levy and Annie Murphy as their children) who suddenly lose everything and have to move to a podunk town that they purchased, forcing them to learn the ways of the hoi polloi. I think that this is the first Canadian series that I've watched consistently, and I love it. You're sure to love it also. Definitely check it out.",1,1,0,1,-999,0,1
Schitt's Creek,"I had heard about but missed this series ... until today when I watched episode one of season one on The CW's Seed online channel. It is a creation of Eugene Levy and his family, and the cast includes his son and his daughter.It is basically a 'Gilligan's Island' story with different key features. Instead of an unforecast storm it is an unforecast loss of money, instead of being marooned on an uncharted island they are cast away to a motel in a small town. They want to escape to their former lives but things keep getting in their way.I like Eugene Levy and here he is pretty good. (He would be 'The Skipper.' ) But all the other characters are very annoying. Overly annoying. Maybe it gets better as the family establishes itself in Schitt's Creek after having all their wealth confiscated but I'll never know. I suppose that is an indication of the impact of an introductory episode. I just hate programs with overly annoying characters.So I gave it a few weeks and one more chance, I watched the episode where Moira is doing a commercial for a local winery. Nope, still a big miss for me. They are all overly annoying in this episode. So my initial evaluation stands. 'Gilligan's Island' was far more entertaining.",-1,-1,-1,-1,0,-1,-1
Schitt's Creek,"I couldn't possibly love anyone more than I do Catherine O'Hara, whose characterizations of ""Dusty Towns,"" and ""Lola Heatherington,"" as well as her brilliant impressions of Elizabeth Taylor, Jane Fonda, and Katharine Hepburn lit up Second City. Here she costars with another member of the hilarious Second City team, Eugene Levy, in ""Schitt's Creek,"" also starring Dan Levy, Annie Murphy, Emily Hampshire, Chris Elliott, and Jennifer Robertson.A wealthy, spoiled family loses everything and winds up in a town they own, Schitt's Creek, living in the local motel. The mother, Moira, is a former soap opera star. Her wall has an assortment of wigs on it; she speaks in an affected voice. The son, David, is Dan Levy, probably gay, who has outrageous taste; his sister, Alexis, is a total airhead who never finished high school; and the head of the family, Johnny, tries to keep them all in line while looking for a way to make some money.Witty, dry, sarcastic, dark, with a core of warmth, this show is a no-miss. It's quirky and fresh with no laugh track. So wonderful to see two Second City stars again.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1
Schitt's Creek,"This is really a Levy family affair. The Comedy is dry and wet depending upon the circumstances. Eugene's son and daughter are both in the cast, but only the son plays his son. His daughter plays a role outside the family. Most of this CBC production cast is Canadian with the American exception of Roland. Levy family have credits for writing and producing too.The strength of this series is definitely the writing. The scripts have some outstanding dramatic moments and dialog between characters that make a lot of other shows pale in comparison. That actually over-rides the annoying over the top characters in the series because it brings them back to being real. Credit Eugene and Dan Levy, a father and son team with this dialog. Granted the cast including them have talent, but without the scripts great dialogue, that talent would come up short.Johnny Rose (Eugene) plays the father who is very careful and yet careless at the same time. The reason this works so well is that this series is mostly set in a small town. This bankrupt big city family moves here in desperation as kind of a last stop after a huge set back in New York City. They move into a motel as it represents their last resort. Moria (Catherine O'Hara) is an extremely annoying mother and former soap actress who is overtaken with herself and her family of wigs. She is sort of in need of a new job for her ego sake. At the same time she is so concerned with the family and adjusting downward from the mansion life style and big city.Speaking of self absorbed, daughter Alexis Rose (Annie Murphy) has not only that in common with her mother, but she is also Intelligent and Flighty too. This plays off Moira well as there are times Alexis can be annoying but more often than not she is annoyed by the rest of the family. She also seems to find men to easily and is poor at picking the right one, much less getting the right one and then losing them at least twice.As annoying as Alexis is, the person she is closest too and annoys the most is David Rose (Dan Levy), the brother whose the exact opposite of his father. David talks faster than anyone else, is obsessed and paranoid all at the same time, and at times is more like Alexis closest sister rather than brother. He has all the most outrageous wardrobe and yet has better tastes in clothes than Alexis though some of his prowess is gotten from his mom Moira who besides her wig has some outrageous tastes of her own. David is out there in more ways than one, as he sort of shares Alexis tastes for men which gives them the closest bond and brother and sister can have.When they move into Schitt's Creek, the motel worker is Stevie Budd (Emily Hampshire). She is very underplayed early on in this series but she often becomes the stable person who all the family and cast play off. While you would not think so at the start, by the end of this show I love Stevie the most.
While she is strong and independent, she is the only one who can say and do the right things at the right times. Without Stevie, this show just would not work as well.Then we have Roland Schitt (Chris Elliott), the Mayor of Schitt's Creek who more often than not is off drinking beer and doing some grass early on. He always has outrageously wrong things to say and do. Roland goes off on tangents that lead into disaster which his wife Jocelyn (Jennifer Robertson) tolerates though at times this wears thin on her.As the series goes along Twyla Sands (Sarah Levy), the cafe waitress gets more and more involved in the story. The slow development of her character is really put on the back burner until the middle of the series. All of a sudden you realize she can act, and her role becomes more defined as an anchor for the family.A couple of seasons or so in, David Rose finally meets Patrick Brewer (Noah Reed) who becomes the apple of his eye and helps David find someone stable he decides to bring into the family. David makes some mistakes along the way with his new business partner but then thanks to Stevie realizes who Patrick is to become in his life.While past failures pretty much overwhelm the family early on, the small town and the folks in it help them find strength and opportunity to come back. There are messages here throughout the series about relationships and how fragile they can become while when the strength develops how the most unlikely of people can team up and accomplish the most unlikely of goals. While the ultimate event to top off this series, the wedding of David and Patrick is accomplished, there is so much more going on around it that the series makes everything seem like positive things can truly result from chaos.This show proves that a tuba theme fits the goings on just fine., and going up Schitt's Creek isn't as bad as it sounds. Even having the name Schitt can be better than it sounds. They even manage to cross the lines of abnormal versus normal without being offensive and have fun doing so.",1,0,1,1,0,-1,1
Schitt's Creek,"So sad to finish this tonight...as I bet others who invested 6 years into it felt when it prematurely went off the air.And boy was it premature. Just watch the Behind-the-Scenes on Netflix. It was the 50% cast and creators (rightfully) crying because it was ending and 50% them wondering why they're ending it so early...and if they'd regret it. I have and I just ended it.That all aside, I can easily see this ending up in my top 15 favorite shows of all-time. I haven't laughed this hard in such a long time and at times, cried even harder at the true love on display. The mainly-comedy M*A*S*H is another one of my favorites that perfectly blended drama and comedy, and knew when to pull back the drama and remind us it is a comedy. Schitt'$ Creek is just like that.I love David and Stevie the best, but everyone else was perfect in their roles and you could tell the entire cast was a family for real on set (and some of them actually were off.) The couple that really made me cry multiple times was Patrick & David.Not since Brokeback Mountain have I've seen such true love between two men on screen. But, even better, none of the baggage. This felt real, and true and no huge, normal gay obstacles in their way. Felt natural.Also, it helps there were many cute men in the show. A TON of extras were cute (mostly Asians) so I always had my eyes focused on the background characters. Lol. But, also Patrick was adorable as ever and Stevie's boyfriend, Emir, was absolutely GORGEOUS.Anyways, this was an incredible show and when I finished binging it tonight, I watched that Netflix Behind the Scenes and then rewatched the pilot episode to see how it all began, again. They ALL grew SO much throughout the seasons.Brilliant show and highly recommended.***Final thoughts: Slight spoilers, but they talk about it a lot in the show, so you're warned to stop here if you hate these, like I do.The ""Simply the Best"" lip-sync scene, the proposal and the wedding had me in utter tears of joy. These actors REALLY convinced me of their love and I know for sure one of them is straight in real life.",1,1,1,1,-999,1,1
Schitt's Creek,"Watched the pilot of this fish-out-of-water series about rich folk who lose everything except a small, run-down town they bought as a joke. It was 22 minutes, I laughed out loud 3 times and chuckled inward a few more times, and generally just found it mild, broad, and predictable. So I didn't bother watching anymore.Years later, after it won a bunch of Emmys, I gave it another chance. The second episode was a little funnier than the first. The third episode had a hilarious scene of Catherine O'Hara haranguing a high school acting class. And buy the end of the first season, those moments of hilarity were common.It's really the women that make this series. Emily Hampshire's snarky Stevie was the one thing I really liked about the first episode and she's a wonderful mix of fragile and tough, Annie Murphy has a uniquely rubbery physical presence (and is also crazy gorgeous) and O'Hara is hilariously awful. On the male side, Dan Levy's David has become better and better (I'm in season 4) and it's also fascinating to see that his rigid physicality is weirdly opposite Murphy's fluidity.The character I like the least is certainly Chris Murphy, who plays the sort of person I would punch if I were the sort of person that punches people. I really wish he'd go away.Anyway, it took me years to really give this series a chance but I'm glad I did.",1,-1,0,0,0,-1,1

Schitt's Creek,"Sort of like a bad car accident while we drive by we just can't take our eyes off of it. No, not every episode of Schitt's Creek is hilariously funny, but neither were the 1960's Beverly Hillbillies, or Green Acres which are both well past their TV prime time but remain in TV history through reruns and DVD sales.I must say that Schitt's Creek is refreshing for the past few years and is now thriving in season 4 as we have gotten to know the ecclectic towns people. What I really, really appreciate about Schitt's Creek and each and every episode is the producers have refrained from utilizing that irritating ""canned hah hah hah hah laughter"" that so dominates many of the so-called comedy TV series that are on today.Schitt's Creek and the Rose family, comprised of father Johnny Rose (Eugene Levy), classy over dressed wife Moira (Catherine O'Hara), prissy daughter Alexis (Annie Murphy), and gay son David (Dan Levy) share equal time on the screen with the rest of the cast that include the seedy motel Manager Stevie Budd (Emily Hampshire), local restuarant waitress named Twyla Sands (Sarah Levy), the Mayor of Schitt's Creek Roland Schitt (Chriss Eliott), gay town councillor Ronnie Lee (Karen Robinson), and David Rose's love interest and business partner Patrick (Noah Reid) to name but a few of this great cast of townsfolk who live and work in Schitt's Creek.This comedy series is especially more enjoyable when you can binge watch several episodes at the same time to get a good feeling of how well blended the cast and story lines are. Don't be offended by the series title as so many IMDB naysayers have utilized to prematurely poor cold water on the series. This series stays away from any political message and is deliberately very inclusive with its cast of characters. I need not say anymore as this series speaks for everyone, not just a select audience.No canned laughter allows Schitt's Creek to stand for what it is, great comedy with an ecclectic cast with refreshing funny storylines that will surely be around for a few more seasons.I give this comedy series a bright 8 out of 10 rating",1,0,1,0,-999,0,-1

Schitt's Creek,There was nothing resembling a good joke in the pilot episode and everything was as predictable as yesterday's weather. Rich family thrown out of their mansion yet they own an entire small town? I don't get it. The show is like a bad episode of Green Acres and they were all bad. So we begin with a tired premise and from there we are given stock characters without a trace of humor or originality and then there is the fact that the writing is amateurish. One of the gags in the first episode is the doors are taken off their motel rooms. I don't get it. How is that funny? Don't answer that because I already know the answer: it isn't funny. The two children are completely annoying which isn't synonymous with funny. Toilet humor rears its ugly head early on. Comedy has gone to this little town to die.,-1,0,-1,-1,0,0,-1
Schitt's Creek,"Binge-watching this series on Netflix in late 2019.
I could watch Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara pull faces for 22 minutes each week and live happily ever after. Toss in Chris Elliott, whose sarcastic shtick is reminiscent of his days on Late Night With David Letterman, and I laughed out loud a lot in the first couple of seasons.
There are also excellent supporting performances from the mayor's dignified wife, played by Jennifer Robertson. the motel owner played by Emily Hampshire (who Canooks will remember as Alan Roy's spoiled daughter in Made In Canada), and many others.
The Rose ''children"" I can take or leave.Annie Murphy plays the daughter well but the writers run out of things for her to do after she goes from one town stud to the next. She deserves better writing. The son is played by series creator Daniel Levy, who is funnier when he's playing ''sarcastic, s3xually ambiguous man in decidedly non-gay setting,"" but gets on my nerves when, roughly about Season 3, the town seems to be overflowing with gay men and David pretty much becomes the central character in an LGBBQWERTY-affirmative action show. After a while I start to feel like I'm watching the sitcom version of the Rainbow parade.
If his show had built on its very strong first 2 seasons and given Chris Elliott more to do, with the focus remaining on the Rose and the Schitts, this could have been an all-time Canadian comedy classic. However, much like when Arrested Development veered away from the parents and their adult sons to focus on the freckle-faced grand-daughter and the doofus grandson, Schitts Creek is a lot less funny when the kids are on the screen. It's more like a Very Special After School Special that I started to resent watching because it was hammering home A BIG MESSAGE.
But by all means, watching those first two seasons. They are genuinely hilarious.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1
Schitt's Creek,"4/9/18. What an absolutely hilarious sitcom! I enjoyed all 3 seasons of this series, and look forward to #4, which I heard just got green-lit. This is like a reverse of The Beverly Hillbillies, and in the vein of Green Acres. An extremely spoiled rich family must learn to make a living after Johnny Rose (Levy) loses his business and all the money that went with it. Now his wife (O'Hara), a has-been actress who has seen much better days, and their two extremely spoiled adult children (Murphy and Levy) must eke out a living at Schitt's Creek. Definitely catch this series!",1,1,1,1,0,1,1
Schitt's Creek,"This tries to be like ""Arrested Development"" but never quite makes it. The acting is pretty dismal, with the actors merely delivering lines with the same predictability over and over, and using the same gestures and facial expressions. This all becomes really tiresome after a while. The editing is poor, and the continuity between scenes, abrupt! The son's character finally comes out round about Season 3 but development of that seems painfully slow. This seems to be a brand of Canadian humor but really doesn't fly globally. It's pretty average but a good watch to download from Netflix and watch on a long bus or train trip!",1,0,0,0,0,1,0

Schitt's Creek,"Another ""fish out of the water"" comedy.Either is a big shot corporate lawyer who loses her job and work as a public defender (Benched) or a spoiled rich girl who ends up serving tables at a terrible dinner (2 Broke girls), this is turns out to be a favorable premise for TV comedic writers. And of course we've seen literally hundreds of movies like this, since forever.Anyway. The important question is, ""is it entertaining""? Well... NO!To begin with, all the characters are paper thin. 2 shallow spoiled adult kids and a neurotic mother, come along with an ex-rich guy who lost his money because he trusted blindly his accountant.The acting is also not good. Eugene Levy is a veteran in the field but you can do so little when the script is flat and the dialogs uninspiring and boring.Dan Levy, Eugene's son, is terrible, with an over-the-top mannerism and poor imitations of his father's grimaces.All the efforts for a joke fail miserably, unless you think a stick bathroom window after someone ""overused"" the toilet is funny.

Schitt's Creek,"Again, comedy is so personal- I got many laughs and smiles out of this show. I felt better after watching it, without feeling stupid. This is more situational comedy than gags, which I like. it ended off on a good note, as if it was a series finale. I am glad to see another season coming. I am now wondering what the last season was that I saw (5?). and there's #6 coming?
**This really could have been a one trick pony- one joke show, and gone no where- but that's not the case- Super Rich family goes broke, destitute, all they own is Schitt's Creek which they bought for a joke bec. of the name. Living in shared rooms in a motel, which makes Motel 6 look Luxury. They stay cheerful.
After 4 seasons, finally, 3 important Emmys. Eugene Levy, actor, writer, creator, Catherine O'Hara, best comedy- up against The Good Place which for me takes all time best. I like Eugene better than Ted- Catherine & Kristen are both great; one has to get it.
I binged watch most of it in 3 or 4 segments- last year- it seemed over-looked-
Catherine has an affected, weird accent & style, fits her & the part. (right now don't have it)
The daughter, Alexis, with that bent wrist, also fits the character, but it's weird. Dan Levy, Eugenes gay son, in life too, stars, wrote, created. yes, some stereotyping, but that's all in the character of the show, bigger than life. As they get past it, it takes them beyond the stereotypes. It's played with panache & style- even the way Catherine's clothes are dramatic, not off the rack, mostly black and white. Dan wears these outrageous artsy sweaters, often black and white- Alexis has a definite style- this contributes to the concept of the show- and creates a visual platform. The personalities, stay the same but EVOLVE, as do the story lines. Eugene at first seems understated, but is very nuanced. As mentioned. at his age how does he keep that dark hair, groomed, no roots. Love his eyebrows. it would be too real, if he went to a near by town to get it done. Also Catherine, high maintenance., never goes to the hair dresser. her cut (&color) requires regular maintenance. someone mentioned Chris Guest- yes, - I would put, Baskets (Louie is genius) the Good Place, some of Arrested Development, & Schitt's Creek in the same category.
after awhile, I can forgive Chris Elliot for being a buffoon. Great ensemble cast.
I love this show",1,1,1,0,1,1,1
Schitt's Creek,So finally got round to binge watching this and yeah it okay but to really honest I let so many episodes pass by just listening to audio it's very repetitive and in my opinion yep humble one not worthy of all the fuss that finally lead me to watching it. I think over 6 series I had 2 LOL moments the best being in the first couple with the schitts creack signpost .I'm not saying its terrible but I've not long since been rewatching arrested development and this is not in same league.There is a special I might watch later,1,0,1,0,1,1,1
Schitt's Creek,"My Review. Season one Schitt's Creek
My Rating 9/10The only question I have is Why has it taken me so long to get acquainted with the Rose family and the residents of Schitts Creek.
If the Trump family were as interesting as The Rose family I could see a rival series but they're not so leave that alone.
Imagine you're a family as wealthy and living the millionaire lifestyle of The Trump's and suddenly the wheels fall off your Gold Cadillac and your left practically penniless and unemployed (one can have hopes and dreams) with just one asset left the deeds to a hokey Midwest hick town named after a pioneer family named Schitt.
The fictional town of Schitt's Creek is located at Pinewood Studios, Toronto, Ontario, Canada and the series was created by Canadian Dan Levy and his father Eugene Levy who also stars as Johnny Rose the head of the family.
Double Emmy Award winner Catherine O'Hara gives the best modern comedian performance I've seen since Lucille Ball cast as Moirai Rose the delightfully elegant dipsomaniac matriarch who in the first series almost equals Lucy's Vitameatavegeman add when she does a tv add for a fruit wine company.
Catherine O'Hara's character ""Moira Rose"" frequently wears black and white stripes as a nod to her role as Delia Deetz in ""Beetlejuice"".
The other three members of the Rose family likeable husband Johnny (Eugene Levy) and their two spoilt but very likeable adult children David (Dan Levy) a pansexual ,according to his Dad who has a particular penchant for male beauty products and his sister Alexis (Annie Murphy) who has a particular penchant for a local Schmitt Creek stud or any young stud in the town.
In a strange real life plot comparison I read that after her house burned down and she had a mere $3 left in her bank account, Annie Murphy considered quitting acting altogether. Fortunately, she got the audition for ""Schitt's Creek"" and landed the iconic role of Alexis. We also have Moira's estranged sister DeeDee played by Jennifer Erwin she lacks Moira's sincerity but like all sibling rivalry provides some great sisterly interactions .
Schitt's Creek Is the first television series to sweep the Prime Time Emmy Awards in all major acting categories in a single year.
I'm thrilled to read there's another 67 episodes of this 9 Emmy Award winning series left to look forward to as I like this family and it's refreshing to watch a series that's clever but uncomplicated and not full of flashbacks and fast forwards or a multitude of characters that just leave you confused .
I can only judge the first series but if the standard of comedy script writing and performances keeps up I'll be watching Schitt's Creek for the duration.
To me this show is contemporary comedy entertainment at its best that pays homage to the great shows of the past years like I Love Lucy, Seinfeld, The Honeymooners , Will and Grace and Sex and the City. However it doesn't copy any of these great shows Schitt's Creek is unique and new.
These American characters are simple folk so likeable with no dramas ,you could never imagine them in a protest march or involved in political activism it seems like a world that's disappeared,no COVID, no violence, some fruity language and lots of funny human foibles and hilarious situations laced with a wicked black sense of comedy.",1,1,1,0,1,1,1
Schitt's Creek,"I rarely watch comedy. I can name a few things I've found funny over the years. King of queens, Seinfeld, Curb, Reno 911, Vice Principals. So I found this a few nights ago and didn't feel like searching for hours well after 2 nights I'm almost finished with the third season. I had an epiphany last night I get this show and it gets me. I don't know why I had that feeling but I did. I laughed the most during my last night run. I even rewound some parts over a few times they were that funny. One was the ""right off"" scene. I didn't care for Alexis at first and now she is my fave. I loved David and still do but he can be annoying. I love Johnny as well. Someone mentioned his facial expressions priceless and I love Bob too. It's rare as I said for me to find something in the comedy genre I'll be sad when finished as I don't have a lot of episodes left at this point. I also can't remember a comedy making me shed some tears as well. This is brilliant and I may go to something else for a bit as to not finish it up so soon and as soon as you start this you can't stop so yeah. Any ways give it a go ( 2 to 3 episodes) after you'll be glad you did.
I wanted to edit to add now that I'm further in and also just came upon the awful reviews. People if something is that bad they don't make it for 6 seasons. Understand it may not be for you but it wouldn't last 6 seasons and be nominated like 200 awards and win over 40 if it were Schitt...",1,1,0,1,0,1,0
Schitt's Creek,"""Schitt's Creek"" is a fish out of water story between an absurdly rich family stuck in a small town in the middle of nowhere. Co- created by Christopher Guest staple Eugene Levy and son Dan Levy, the series is highly watchable and gets a lot of mileage out of a its premise but the show is a little low on laughs and not too much is fleshed out in this world. Similarly, the Rose family has a lot of blanks that no one seems to care about filling in. They're not just wealthy but wealthy to the point of absurdity. The unrealistic arrested development of their kids is reminiscent of ""Step Brothers"" where there are expectations that you'll suspend your disbelief about how people can get that old and know so little about the world. When Dave needs to get a job, he asks if there are any openings in this small town for art curating. An effeminate brat who's likely gay but is restricted to asexuality at the moment (possibly because sex would get in the way of his daily sulking rituals), Dave is the weakest character on the show in that we know only what he doesn't like (being around his sister, the town, daylight) and not what drives him. He would be more at home in the bratty teen comedies of the late 90s than he would in Doc Hollywood. The only thing that interests him is the equally sarcastic hotel worker (Emily Hampshire, MVP of the show) who bonds with him through their mutual love of being jaded adolescents (which, again, seems awkward considering he's over 30).Chris Elliott finds his footing here as the kind of oddball sitcom character that would only exist in a quirky world like this. Maybe it's just me because I saw more Chris Elliott in the '90s than any other decade, but I would have trouble seeing Elliott in a comedy without that old-school quirkiness as opposed to something set in the present day. On the whole, it's still an entertaining show and I'd be on board for a second season.",1,1,0,1,-999,1,0

Sweet Home,"The story rushes into assorted monster attacks too quickly without establishing an emotional connection with the characters or background story. Not scary or exciting if you don't care for the characters. Unusual for a Korean series to lack an emotional connection. This series has a one dimensional story with less depth than usual. Only later in flashbacks do you get to know the characters but it's too late by then. The viewer is plunged into a post apocalyptic gory mess quite quickly without enough explanation and the attacks feel repetitive and monotonous. And the gratuitous violence is out of place in a Korean series.
Visually the monsters and effects look good. The cast is good and likeable with 18 Again's Lee Do Hyun, Love Alarm's Song Kang, Lee Jin Wook surprisingly good as a tough guy and Park Kyu Yung of It's Okay.

Sweet Home,"Enjoyable, but somewhat odd. The creatures are great, not always realistic looking. That's not what's odd. What's odd is overly long shots of people just looking or staring with no expression on their faces.Maybe it's a cultural thing but no one really seems to react to anything with fear, even curiosity. Things just happen in front of them and they just stand there staring at it. A 10-ft tall thing with elongated legs and arms and everyone just stands there going, what is that? And then as it approaches them, nobody moves they just stand there. Its it's bizarre.A lot of characters are introduced, but you start to be able to distinguish who's who and what they're doing and who's brave, who's a coward, who probably needs to be killed by the monsters, and who you're going to enjoy being killed by the one of the monsters.Another strange aspect to this series is Marlboro Man. the dude in the suits what's up with him is he infected, is he not infected, or did he just happen to be caught up in this when he was robbing somebody???I'm three episodes in and I can't tell yet.

Yes, the CGI isn't the best, but it's also not the worst I've seen either.
The core of this show is this group of random people in an apartment complex trying to survive a sudden monster apocalypse. It is gritty, dark, and somewhat confusing.All that being said, I really and unexpectedly loved this show. The weirdness of it intrigued me in the first episode, and by episode 3 I was fully hooked. The characters are really, really great and you can't help but root for them to survive. I loved the soundtrack, especially the use of Imagine Dragons ""Warrior."" I can't really explain why I loved this show so much, it was just this perfect combination of weird and exciting and gory that kept me completely immersed until the very last second.

Newly introduced monster designs were crappy and sub part, in comparison to the beginning.I just hope, that if this show gets the second season, they'll get more money to bring in some new cool looking monster designs, rather than focusing on people fighting people, like they did as the season progressed.",-1,-1,-1,-1,0,-1,-1
Sweet Home,"The ideas and premise shown in Sweet Home aren't new. You have people turn into monsters and basically causing the end of the world as we knew it. I like the idea of how the humans are turning and being affected in different ways by this I guess you may call it possession.Unfortunately the execution makes it all feel completely fake. It's not just the CGI that makes it look fake. It's also how the transformation happens, how people act and even the changes themselves.Just to give a quick example on why this feels fake. Even though it isn't said when exactly it's happening towards the end of the first season we can see it starting to snow. So it plays around late autumn and early winter. This means usually it's rather cold outside. Except for one comment made by a kid no one ever refers to it being cold outside or how winter and snow may affect them. Winter in an apocalyptical event is usually a pretty serious issue. Here it's not even considered.In general food and water seem to be just some minor inconvenience that are also only mentioned once and then never again.The show is focused on human interaction and drama and unfortunately fails there too as the characters aren't feeling real for the most part and I'd call them one-dimensional.Towards the end of season one they also go for a very big cliché which is often found in zombie movies and honestly it's just not believable. In addition early on the monsters are established as a considerable threat. However the show shifts the focus away from the threat of the monsters and suddenly they barely make any appearances and are only a nuisance instead of an actual threat. You got to have your human drama...One more thing that really bothered me, was that throughout the whole season we stay in that one big apartment building. I still know nothing about how that building is even structured. We're jumping around between places within the building and often (especially in later episodes) it's not clear where the characters actually are within the building. And btw. with all the destruction going on there apparently was no real issue with getting electricity and that especially is not really believable.Honestly I wanted to like the show and I watched through season one within one week. Throughout it my rating was constantly going up and down between 3/10 and 7/10 because it has a few good scenes. Unfortunately looking at the overall result and also considering the poor choice and placement of the soundtrack at times I can't rate it higher.",-1,0,-1,-1,-1,0,-1

The storyline is a jumbled trash heap that has no narrative, a bunch of emotive drama that is manipulative to try and make you feel bad for the most annoying characters I've ever had to listen to. Then there is the element of survival and that's not enough to hook me in because the runtime is an hour an episode of random crap happening with barely any context and its just a very weird show. The soundtrack is horrendously edited in and it is not original scoring, it is mostly remixed songs and Imagine Dragons... just ew. The actors do an alright job, but the cinematographer really captures color beautifully, especially in the first episode... however its not enough to save this heaping pile of crap. I thought this was going to be a show with well fleshed out characters that at least know each other, but it is just a bunch of people in an apartment complex, there is no tension, no good direction, it just all feels like random stuff happening and no real plan or narrative.

Sweet Home,"I wonder if the people who rated this poorly gave up too early. I was one of them, I gave it 5 stars and moved on. But something about it was intriguing, so I came back. Ep 1 was promising, then it went downhill, I dropped it after Ep 3, but when I came back and I didn't regret it. I'm now rating it with a solid 8. The characters were annoying, yes, but they grew on me. Many dialogues and reactions seemed rather stupid, but they leaded to some great scenes. This series has a nice atmosphere, beautiful actors with lots of charisma. I liked the soundtrack and the CGI (yes, I do!). My biggest issue was the storytelling. They told too many stories at the same time. You want to know what happens to a certain character, but you have to wait, because other stories get in the way. I would have preferred it, if they finished one story arc and then moved on. I wasn't bothered by this kind of storytelling that much later on, when the series progressed. Most likely because the characters grew on me, and I was equally invested in everyone of them. To make it short: interesting survival/zombie/monster plot with annoying characters who became less annoying the more you know about them, decent CGI, decent music, some very good coloring and atmosphere. Some very good directing, some very bad directing and yeah ... Could have been better, but they did a good job most of the time. Some scenes were really bad, some were brilliant. Sometimes the action was incredible, sometimes it looked cheap or they just skipped a scene so you didn't even know what happened. It is, what it is.

I do like all the characters, and I love the acting, they have some of my favorite supporting characters in other Korean shows. It develops and it changes. It's not your typically survive from monsters tv show, it brings a different element to it. I really hope it has a second season and this is higher than a 7.5 in my opinion. I think it has potential to 7.8-8.3 overall. Each character have their own story and there is more story to come. I wish people would leave reviews after watching a few episodes instead of jumping to conclusion. I agree, I did not like it at first and I thought about it like a dark comedy but it develop into something serious, especially when you like all the characters. People, please, chill out and give it a try. Support new ideas instead of bashing on it with weak reviews. I think it's a 8.3 but I'll rate it a 10 to help with the ratings because it will turn away people, it's not bad of a tv show as how some people made it to be. I already binged 9 episodes in 2 days.

I recommend watching with the original Korean voice with English subtitles, I tried to watch it with English voice overs but it just wasn't as good.

It's like they skip 5 seconds forward during action scenes and you lose track of what's going on.Also the script should've been separated into seasons or cut down, because the impact of certain events doesn't hit as hard since there isn't much time for character development.Personally I hoped that Netflix would go with the originally dark tone that the Webtoon.

( Stare longingly into the fridge). Watching your neighbour get devoured by a hideous demon (stare longingly into neighbours intestines). Saving your friends from certain death by simply closing a door ( stare longingly at door handle) it's relentlessly like this from start to finish.",-1,,-1,-1,0,-1,-1

The Croods: A New Age,"Granted, I have not seen the previous animated movies in ""The Croods"" franchise, so I wasn't really sure what I was venturing into here. But my 10 year old son wanted to watch this 2020 animated movie, so I sat down to watch it with him.And color me impressed.""The Croods: A New Age"" was actually rather enjoyable. Not only was the storyline pretty entertaining, but it was also an all together enjoyable animated movie. So I was definitely more than surprised with this one. But as I haven't seen the previous movies, then I wasn't familiar with the characters or the stories, so I didn't really have much to put this 2020 addition up against.The animation and art style in ""The Croods: A New Age"" was pretty good. I was enjoying what I was seeing on the screen. And the attention to detail was just spectacular. And it was hard not to get to take a liking to most of the characters and creatures that were on the screen.And as an animated movie, having a proper ensemble of voice actors and actresses is alpha and omega. And I will say that they definitely had that in ""The Croods: A New Age"". I mean, with the voices of Emma Stone, Ryan Reynolds, Nicolas Cage, Catherine Keener, Cloris Leachman, Leslie Mann, Peter Dinklage and Kelly Marie Tran - to name but the most recognizable of names - what is there not to like?My rating of ""The Croods: A New Age"" lands on a six out of ten stars.

The Bettermans try to have Guy fall for there daughter while Grug (Nicholas Cage) makes a deal with them since he is disliking the idea his daughter Eve wants to start a life with Guy. While the Bettermans are holding a secret about there perfect home.The plot is pretty decent. The Croods are living a different lifestyle with the Bettermans. While they are trying to handle the Croods lifestyle. Grug is having trouble letting go his daughter is growing up. The story is not as strong as the original but still fun for the whole family.The animation, visuals, and soundtrack are fun. And good. The direction with Croods mother and Eve and grandmother teaming with Bettermans mother and daughter to go save the guys was a little cheesy as it tries for that punk rock star tone.

The Santa Clause,"When a toy manufacturer (Tim Allen) inadvertently kills Santa (actor unknown) on Christmas Eve, he finds himself magically recruited to take his place. Tim Allen has a criminal record and Disney has a no hiring of ex-cons policy. An exception was made in this case. Odd, really. They had first considered Bill Murray and Chevy Chase, but settled on Allen. I think this may have been good. While both Chase or Murray could possibly have been better, they also both have their own notable Christmas movies, so it was time to pick a new comedian.I am not big on Tim Allen, despite liking ""Home Improvement"" and enjoying his role here for the most part. I am, however, a fan of Judge Reinhold. This film is really great, though Reinhold gets the shaft. He is more or less a background character who wears ugly sweaters. (Why he has such a strong interest in the custody of a kid that is not his is open to speculation.) Allen shines, and as far as kids movies go, this is a pretty good one. Not sure how well it jibes with other Christmas or Santa myths, but I guess kids are not smart enough to really put that all together.There could also be some debate about whether or not Santa is ""killed"". He falls off a roof, moves his hand a bit, and disappears. Now maybe this is because it would be too grim for a kids movie to have a corpse in a snow bank, but I suspect he did not actually die but simply faded away... it is left open to speculation.One nice thing about this film is how it has humor for a wide age range. While geared towards children for the most part, there is still a healthy dose of more adult humor. No outright sex or violence, but some not-too-veiled references to drug use and other things not necessarily appropriate. But this is why it worked to cast Allen, because having him be completely G-rated seems out of place.Definitely a much better Tim Allen Christmas film than ""Christmas With the Kranks"".",1,0,1,-1,0,1,1
The Santa Clause,"I hope Disney has moved on from this sort of thing. For some reason, I think they have, making a little more solid ""family films.""This turned out to be yet another modern-day ""family film"" that had all the typical Disney features: a story based on a character who lies frequently; a number of subtle sex jokes (such as obscene telephone numbers), a snotty and unrealistic lead kid who uses an unrealistic vocabulary and is shown to be more mature than his bumbling Dad. (Intelligence, loving fathers are never found in these PC fiasco's). And, of course, we have the divorced family: the only kind Hollywood knows.Other than that, it's a nice holiday family film!",1,0,1,-999,0,1,-999
The Santa Clause,"I had never truly understood the meaning behind the spelling of the word Clause in the title, so with all the sequels being shown after this original during Christmas I decided to watch this once again, from director John Pasquin (Jungle 2 Jungle, Miss Congeniality 2: Armed & Fabulous). Basically Scott Calvin (Tim Allen) has been divorced from ex-wife Laura (Wendy Crewson) for some time now, and though she is married to a slightly annoying Dr. Neil Miller (Beverly Hills Cop's Judge Reinhold), he still has access to his six year old son Charlie (Eric Lloyd). Still a big believer of Santa Claus, Scott doesn't want to upset Charlie, and on Christmas Eve there is an unexpected visitor, and shouting up to the man in the red suit, Scott unintentionally causes him to fall off. Charlie comes outside and sees that his Dad has seemingly killed Santa Claus, a supposed identity card confirms who he is, and there is a note saying that he should put on the coat and take over the sleigh and reindeer. So with Charlie urging him on, Scott does indeed put on the red coat and is taken from house to drop off the hundreds of presents to houses far and wide. Eventually the delivering is over and they are taken to the North Pole and the workshop of many elves, who admittedly look like children but are working very hard for next year. Lead elf Bernard (David Krumholtz) tells him that because he put on the red coat he is now taking over all responsibilities, this is the Santa Clause (a law contract or regulation, you would get one with a divorce), and he is now the new Santa Claus. So not long after returning home for the remaining year before December approaches, Charlie is still insisting to everyone that his father is Santa Claus, while Scott develops the big guy attributes, such as the white hair, a beard that won't go away and a big gut that won't be slimmed. Eventually he has truly become Santa Claus and there is nothing he can do about it, so he accepts his responsibility, and returns to the North Pole ready to steer the sleigh and reindeer. There is a point when Laura and Neil tried to stop Scott seeing Charlie, and the police get involved with finding Santa Clais, but in the end, everything settles. Also starring Larry Brandenburg as Det. Nunzio, Mary Gross as Miss Daniels, Paige Tamada as Judy the Elf, Peter Boyle as Mr. Whittle and Judith Scott as Susan Perry. I didn't realise this was the first feature film Allen starred in, a good debut as a Scrooge like working father with quite a few sarcastic comments, and it of course led him to become the voice of Toy Story's Buzz Lightyear. The story is filled with some clever Christmassy reference, many funny slapstick and sentimental moments you've come to expect from Disney, all in all, a fun for all the family seasonal fantasy comedy.

The Santa Clause,"Cynical businessman and single dad Tim Allen gets to be the new St. Nicholas after the actual Santa Claus takes a spill Christmas morning. Thin holiday confection from screenwriters Leo Benvenuti and Steve Rudnick is fairly tolerable until the desperate third act (featuring a police search for Tim's missing child). Allen, then a popular TV fixture on the hit sitcom ""Home Improvement"", easily carried his Everyman appeal onto the big screen with this sugar-coated perennial. The success of the film was not inexplicable, however the results are not particularly witty or inventive. Kids enjoyed it at the time, but of course; the humor is purely television (without the interruptions). Followed by two sequels. ** from ****",0,1,1,0,-999,0,0

His father role is played for laughs but also has his tender side when moments call for it. His needling of JUDGE REINHOLD about his awful sweaters becomes a running joke. So do many of the other amusing moments in a script that is both clever and highly original. ERIC LLOYD proves to be an appealing child actor as the boy who urges his father to be a substitute Santa.To get a flavor of the dialog, just take a look at the ""quotes"" from the film on the Quote page.It's handsomely produced in wonderful color to give the film its winter atmosphere (filmed in Canada).Summing up: It's worth going along for the ride.

But, he really does a bang up job here and this is a favorite film.Judge Reinhold as Dr. Miller brings the same cutting edge humor that he had with Eddie Murphy in the Beverly Hills Cop movies. he is a riot as a psychologist.And, of course, there's Bernard (David Krumholtz), the head elf, that really makes a great comic pair with Allen.And, damn it, Judy (Paige Tamada) was just so cute!",1,1,-999,1,1,1,-999

The Santa Clause,"The Santa Clause (1994): Dir: John Pasquin / Cast: Tim Allen, Eric Lloyd, Wendy Crewson, Judge Reinhold, David Krumholtz: Delightfully funny holiday film about the promise of good will. Tim Allen stars as a divorcée who stays with his son on Christmas Eve. That night there arouses such a clatter and behold on the roof was a figure in a red suit. Allen startles him and he tumbles off the roof and melts away leaving behind the suit. He puts it on upon investigating the sleigh and he and his son are whisked away. What follows is a night of delivering gifts before retiring to the North Pole. An elf informs him that he accepts Santa's duties once the suit is placed on Allen. They wake up at home but details of their adventure causes concern for the ex-wife. No explanation given regarding appearing chimneys where they never were before. Interesting plot with detail and charm directed by John Pasquin. Allen is superb in his bewilderment as he struggles with his situation as well as the enthusiasm of his son. Eric Lloyd provides the awe as his son whose belief goes into overload. Unfortunately supporting roles are a disappointment. Wendy Crewson and Judge Reinhold are flat. David Krumholtz plays head elf Bernard whose name is foiled immediately by Allen. Theme regards the idea of Santa resulting in ideas, wonder and astounding visual holiday magic.

The Santa Clause,"Scott Calvin is disgusted to learn that his ex and her husband have tried to break it to son Charlie that Santa isn't real. On Christmas Eve, Scott reads The Night Before Christmas... then receives an unexpected visitor on his roof. When he's startled by Scott's calling out and falls, Santa vanishes leaving only an 8-reindeer sleigh and a suit with instructions to put it on if he's involved in an accident. Scott does, and is transported around the town dropping gifts through chimneys until he's taken to the North Pole and informed by a group who claim they're elves that he is now Santa. Charlie is proud of his dad's new job, though Scott's convinced it's a dream. Until his hair turns white, his beard refuses to stay shaved, he gains weight inexplicably, even for his sudden love of junk food.....Less of a Christmas movie and more of a starring role for Allen to make it big in Hollywood, the film mildly succeeds on both accounts, after all this is Allens second franchise with Disney, and the film profited enough to garner more sequels.But it hasn't aged well, like other classic Christmas movies and its due to the sarcastic tone and yuppie attitude Calvin has during the first act.This was boring in 1995, and watching it with my daughter seventeen years later, she was losing interest very fast.The film does redeem itself when we reach the north pole, but the adult humour and the childish tones do not bond well.It's a good film to watch one cold Christmas afternoon, Allen is a presence and the support is great.

The Santa Clause,"The Santa ClausESome SpoilersComedian Tim Allen rose out of TV land and the comedy circuit when he starred in ""The Santa ClausE"" in 1994. If I recall, it did fairly well at the box office, and carved a new name for Tim Allen as a film star.
Allen plays Scott Calvin, a busy father to Charlie, who has been having doubts as to the existence of a certain Mr. Claus, recently. On Christmas Eve, Charlie spends the night over at Dad's house, and during the night, they have an unexpected visitor: Santa Claus. But after an unbelieving Scott scares Santa up on the roof, causing him to fall and die (or evaporate). So, Scott tries on Santa's suit for no apparent reason, and he and his son are whisked away to The North Pole, which consists of...well...a little pole sticking out of the ground with a built in security feature. After a little elf activates the pole, Charlie and Scott are sucked underground into Santa Claus' work shop, where they meet Italian Head Elf Bernard, as well as cheery, 800-year-old children called elves. Bernard explains to Scott that by putting on the suit, he has accepted the role of Santa Claus, and will be Santa Claus until he is ""Unable to do so, either by accident or design.""
So, that is what starts this cheery holiday fable. We see Scott coming to facts that he is Santa, including a beard sprouting out of his face every time he shaves, and a big, fat beer gut that comes out of nowhere. Not only that, but pretty soon ex-wife Wendy Crewson is beginning to become a little worried with Scott's far-from-normal appearances, so she and new-beau Judge Reinhold try to keep Charlie away from his father...even if it means filing for, 'No-visitation-rights,"" as Crewson says.The film is a nice family treat. It is not what I would call a Christmas Classic, but it is one that I usually see every year just because I own it. Tim Allen's performance itself is worth seeing the film for. It is one of his best, other than the ""Toy Story"" films. Perhaps the fact that he hasn't really been in many other films is why I say it is one of his best performances. Anyway, he does good. There is one particular moment that is very reminiscent of Allen's humor. Scott is at a meeting with boss Peter Boyle, and new toy designs are flying by. One includes ""Turbo Tank Santa,"" which shows a picture of Santa sitting in an army tank. Scott - because he is now Santa - is outraged, and goes on about how it is just wrong to show Santa in a tank. He then imitates a woman, and says, ""Well, Timmy, I hope you've been good this year, because Santa just took out the Ferguson's house! INCOMING!"" I love that part. It is, perhaps, the finest moment of the film...All in all, `The Santa ClausE' is not one of the smartest of hippest films I've seen before, but it's pretty funny.

The Santa Clause,"This is one of the first Christmas movies with a plot about someone turning into or becoming Santa Claus. The plot is strange, but far out enough to be somewhat interesting. The clause is in the contract. This is mostly comedy in a modern fairy tale. The sets, elaborate toy and workshop displays, and camera work are some of the pluses for this film. ""The Santa Clause"" just skirts on the edge of having a Christmas message. The various cast members are OK in their roles. Tim Allen is fine as Scott Calvin, whose initials just happen to be the same as those of Santa Claus. Judge Reinhold is OK in a familiar role as a lame Dr. Neil Miller. Wendy Crewson is OK as Laura, and Eric Lloyd plays Charlie Calvin. The various kids in the roles of elves aren't convincing enough for a kid's imagination. Some films were very good that used midget actors and other small people with excellent costumes and makeup. The wise-guy persona of Bernard the Elf (played by David Krumholtz) may be an effort to make this film modern, but it loses something more – in the image and lore of the North Pole elves.The film is good for a couple of laughs and smiles. But it's not of a caliber to be in an annual holiday film collection.",-1,-1,0,-1,0,-1,1
The Santa Clause,"The Santa Clause is all around the perfect family Holiday film. I don't mean to imply its a perfect film because it is of course silly, implausible, full of product placement (good ol' Disney), but its also sweet and fun and magical. Watching our main character's transformation into Santa is easily one of the most memorable in Christmas film history. The movie really has everything you could possibly want from a Christmas film right from square one with familiar Christmas classics, a middle aged divorced father more concerned with his career than his family, Santa, presents, North Pole, elves, magic...you name it. It is all here. There is also a ton of hidden little Easter Eggs (pardon the pun) in the film from Mickey Mouse's hidden face in the moon to elves hiding amongst the humans throughout the movie. Its a fantasy adventure comedy that kids will absolutely adore and adults can still smile even if its a guilty little pleasure. Best of all the film is full of magic and morals and is squeaky clean save few a couple of stupid fart jokes in the beginning (I hate fart jokes but they are there for better or for worse.) Tim Allen blew everyone away with his comedy on Home Improvement in the 90's and with this film he proved his chemistry could translate to the big screen. Allen really is fantastic in this movie. He goes from the selfish single Dad to Santa in all the right ways and makes the unbelievable believable. Eric Lloyd does a great job as Allen's son. He isn't amazing but this is really one of his first films and he is absolutely right for the part. The chemistry between him and Allen is perfect and fits the film. Wendy Crewson is Allen's ex-wife and she is good in the role. She doesn't get a lot of time on screen and her best scenes are towards the end when she comes around to the idea of her ex-husband being Santa Claus. Judge Reinhold is really the closest thing you get to a ""villain"" in the movie and he isn't quite that. He's a grown up who refuses to accept a concept like Santa Claus. They do make him awfully unlikable though which is unfortunate. However, he serves a purpose and mostly is there for Allen to make sarcastic jokes about. His scenes near the end when he comes around to Santa are really silly and poorly done in my opinion. David Krumholtz is sorely underused as the head elf. He is a very funny actor and I think there could have been more done with him and the relationship between him and Allen.Director John Pasquin had worked with Allen on Home Improvement and a few projects since then including his new sitcom ""Last Man Standing."" They likely know each other very well and know the style of comedy. I'm not sure he's the optimal choice for a family Christmas film but he absolutely gets it done in the right away. Perhaps my only but would be that there could have been more character development with the supporting cast and I felt like the ending is very rushed. They spend a lot of time building up this story and then it seems as though they realized they spent too much time and have to wrap it up very quickly. Nonetheless, this is a lot of fun and you will certainly enjoy watching it and you'll smile a lot. For me, it wasn't laugh out loud funny like I expected it to be but its simple and cute. There is a lot of magic for the little ones and you can't fault them at all for making something like that. Its worthy of adding to your family Christmas film rotation every year! I'm looking forward to following this up with the two sequels, one of which I have never seen. 7/10",1,0,1,0,0,1,1

The Santa Clause,"This is a delightful Christmas movie which my wife and I savoured on Christmas Eve, not having watched it before (and how many Christmas films can you say that about)? Like all the best Yuletide films, it requires the viewer to take a leap of faith and believe the unbelievable so that once you do that you're taken along for the ride and in this case, an entertaining and amusing ride it certainly is.Tim Allen stars as the divorced dad who feels diminished next to his ex-wife and her new man, who naturally is younger, better-looking and higher-earning, though with a taste for gaudily patterned pullovers. Even his relationship with his young son is beginning to pall, despite his best, if misguided efforts but when his rival, a myth-defying, dream-denying psychiatrist attempts to brainwash young Charlie that Santa doesn't exist, it's obvious that it's going to take something exceptional for him to turn the situation around. Cue a fateful encounter with an unexpected visitor on the roof on Christmas Eve and the fun really starts.While some of the special-effects are a little weak, in general this movie gently and neatly encapsulates the elusive Christmas spirit with a nicely judged mix of childish wonder and knowing humour for grown-ups,making it an easy film for parents and children to watch together. Neat touches abound, with pointy-eared elves turning up everywhere, running gags inserted into the narrative and some pleasing sight gags (I liked especially the cops map of the area surrounding Allen's house as they set up the Santa sting, a do-nut shop prominently highlighted for easy reference).Allen makes for a believable, under-achieving dad who eventually accepts his transformation and so wins back his son's affection. The child actor playing his son too I found refreshingly cute-free. Interestingly, the story has no real baddie to pitch them up against, unless you're going to vilify Judge Reinhold for denying Santa's existence.Watching this pleasant and amusing film certainly set our household up for this coming Christmas in what I certainly rate as one of the superior Christmas-themed films.",1,1,1,-1,-1,1,-1
The Santa Clause,"It gets more difficult this time each year to sit down in front of a good Christmas film, but this Disney feature from the 90's was a pleasant surprise. Tim Allen is the fast-talking salesman single parent trying to connect with his reluctant young son on Christmas Eve. Junior it seems would rather be with his mother and her new man, a confident, handsome psychiatrist with a penchant for wearing garish sweaters. The only thing that really links the boy with his dad is their shared belief in Santa Claus unlike his more modern-thinking mum and partner. Christmas Eve goes fairly disastrously between father and son, as they find themselves in a cafe amusingly populated by a host of other single dads and their kids after Tim burns the turkey before the tetchy, tired dad puts his son down to bed for the big sleep. However when they're awakened by noises on the roof, an unimaginable chain of events opens up ahead of them, not only affecting this Christmas but all their Christmases to come.For me the film pitched itself just nicely between catering to adults and children. There are plenty of good grown-up, but never crude, if you can forgive a couple of flatulence episodes, jokes and sight-gags especially as Allen's plight dawns on him, even a simple one like the police sketch-plan used to corner this new Santa prominently featuring a cop's favourite haunt, the do'nut shop, had me smiling. Sure one or two of the kids playing elves seemed to be reading their lines off cue-cards, but head elf Bernard and especially the little girl playing the worldly elf Judy are a delight.Allen himself is very good, especially when he bulks up to fill the big man's shoes (and robe and hat) and if his boy Charlie initially seems like another production-line cute, smart, mop-haired kid, even he gets some neat lines and develops a likeable personality. The special effects are nice, involving the reindeer sleigh and answering that old chestnut as to how Santa gets down chimneys without fireplaces, even if they are slightly dated by modern standards and I liked the ending for the way it didn't take the easy resolution it looked for a long time it was headed.In short, this was very enjoyable festive family entertainment, recommended Christmas viewing.",1,1,1,0,1,0,1
The Sound of Music,"This review contains LOTS of spoilers. My advice is not to read my review at all, as it will no doubt hinder your enjoyment of this wonderful film! I mean it--DON'T READ ON.....I adored ""The Sound of Music"" when I saw it for the first time when I was 16. I loved the film and was completely infatuated with Julie Andrews. Frankly, this isn't at all surprising as practically EVERYONE was in love with Julie Andrews after they watched the film! What wasn't to like?! The music was AMAZING, the story very romantic and the film uplifting throughout. However, I made a mistake. I loved the film so much that I read up on the real Von Trappe family--and it was little like the wonderful family in the film! The Captain was actually always a pretty nice guy and Frauline Maria wasn't exactly 'practically perfect in every way'! To make things MUCH worse, I traveled to Salzburg, Austria several decades later--and I learned THE TRUTH!!! The wonderful Von Trappe home in the film was actually a composite of about a half dozen different homes in the area! The gazebo was miles from the riverfront which was miles from the interior of the Von Trappe home--and the truth got worse! When we visited the cemetery where the family hid out at the end of the film, we were shocked (and VERY offended) at a memorial in this cemetery for the SS--the same folks that manned the death camps! All in all, this is a case where the truth really, really hurt. And, although I am a history teacher who loves historical accuracy, this is a case where I wish I'd never learned the truth. Heck, at the end of the film, you see the family escaping over the Alps to freedom--and in real life, they just took a train to Italy!! Hrmmph!!",1,1,1,0,1,1,0
The Sound of Music,"I know this movie is long, but it is a timeless musical nonetheless. The thing i loved most was the songs by Rodgers and Hammerstein. They are amazing, and make the movie what it is. Another reason why I love it is the magnificent performance of Julie Andrews as Maria, a young woman who wishes for a better life, I suppose. Maria is pretty, with a beautiful voice, mixed with brashness and sadness, all the qualities that Andrews gives to her performances. The only film she disappoints slightly in is Thoroughly Modern Millie. The choreography is superb, as well as the supporting cast, from the likes of Christopher Plummer and co. i can't pick a favourite scene, but who can forget the opening and the ""Do ah Dear"" sequence? i also thought the children were sweet and the film had a number of clever subplots, like Liesels's secret love. 10/10 for a musical, that should be in the top 250. It was number 2 on the Greatest Musicals, losing out to Grease. Bethany Cox",1,1,1,1,1,1,1
The Sound of Music,"I was fortunate enough to see The Sound of Music on Broadway with the original cast minus Mary Martin, her part had been taken over by Martha Wright at that point. The production was good, but the thing I like best about The Sound of Music was how well Robert Wise transferred it to the screen. I defy anyone to show any trace of stage origin in this magnificently photographed film from that aerial opening with Julie Andrews singing the title song to the end with the Von Trapp family climbing every mountain.The main difference between the stage production and the screen version is that the role of the Baroness Elsa Schrader played by Eleanor Parker is a singing role. With the casting of Ms. Parker, a talented player but no singer, certain songs out of necessity had to be eliminated. Eleanor is fine in her role, but I do wonder if Robert Wise meant to cast a singer in her part originally. On Broadway the Baroness was played by Marion Marlowe.Julie Andrews who became a Broadway star in My Fair Lady and Camelot and didn't do either role for the screen, gives her greatest screen performance in a Broadway role originally written for someone else. There was some criticism that Mary Martin was too old to be playing Maria in the original play, but she certainly was guaranteed box office on Broadway. Julie Andrews was just right for the part and she's in great voice. I always marvelled listening to her at the perfect diction she was able to maintain hitting those high notes.Christopher Plummer took over the role that Theodore Bikel on Broadway and he too gained a signature role for his screen career. I've always felt that the talented Mr. Plummer has never been given the credit due him. He was a perfect Duke of Wellington in Waterloo and his portrayal of Commodus in The Fall of the Roman Empire is the highlight of that film. I like Christopher Plummer because he's also never taken himself seriously though he takes his art very seriously. I don't think too many other actors today could have played that comic villain in the Tom Hanks/Dan Ackroyd Dragnet movie and done it with such obvious zest and enjoyment.A real old timer got into this film with Peggy Wood playing the Mother Abbess at the Convent where Maria is a postulant. Ms. Wood's Broadway career dates back to 1911 and on stage she introduced songs by such people as Victor Herbert, Jerome Kern, Sigmund Romberg, and Noel Coward. You've got to be real good to get folks like that to write for you. And now her art is preserved in one of the most popular films of all time.The charm of the music and the leads and the kids sometimes obscures the anti-Nazi message that The Sound of Music conveys. The story takes place in Austria before and during the Anschluss. Christopher Plummer makes no secret of disgust for the Nazis and all they stand for. The Sound of Music makes it clear he is very much in a minority in terms of Austria uniting with Germany. Of course the irony is that Anschluss did not quite turn out for the Austrians as they hoped it would.The Sound of Music, it's story, it's music, it's lyrics and it's charm will stay with you and never leave after a hundred viewings.",1,1,0,0,1,0,1
The Sound of Music,"A fairly engaging - and classic - family musical, although not my favourite. Robert Wise's multi Oscar-winning production sees Julie Andrews unleashing her singing voice once more (after MARY POPPINS) during a true story about a large family living in 1930s Austria during the rise of the Nazi party.First, let's get the detractions out of the way. The film is a little overlong and gets bogged down in a syrupy romance around halfway through that drags it down. I've never been able to like Julie Andrews; there's just something twee and too perfect about her, and that opinion is reinforced here.On the plus side, there are some great and well-regarded musical numbers here, and they've stayed in the public consciousness for a reason. There's a wonderful supporting turn from Christopher Plummer, and the seven children are all fine and really give the film their all. Wise's direction is strong, and he manages a fine and suspenseful climax that works well in conjunction with the sugary stuff that's come before. In essence, THE SOUND OF MUSIC is essential viewing for musical fans, even if I don't agree that it's quite as brilliant as it's made out to be.",0,-1,-1,1,1,-1,0
The Sound of Music,"In pre-WWII Salzburg, Austria, the Mother Abbess doesn't know what to do with the flighty Maria (Julie Andrews). How do you solve a problem like Maria? Maria fearfully accepts being the governess to Captain Georg von Trapp (Christopher Plummer)'s seven children. The kids don't like her at first. She is the 12th in a long line of governesses. She eventually wins them over. The Captain is a widower who runs a cold strict household. The Baroness Elsa Schraeder (Eleanor Parker) accompanies him back from Vienna with singing producer Max Detweiler (Richard Haydn). However he starts to fall for the lovely governess and she for him. The jealous Baroness pushes her out of the way and the Captain asks the Baroness to marry him.Everybody is entitled to their opinion but I can't imagine anybody not appreciating the simple joy of this musical. The main objections seem to be the movie's departure from the real story. I don't know how much Nazism these critics want but it is a musical after all. Nobody is watching this for its authenticity. The songs are simply innocent fun. They are endlessly singable and Julie Andrews is the perfect Broadway ingénue with great screen presence. Christopher Plummer provides the compelling leading man. This is probably one of the best romantic musicals.",1,1,1,0,1,1,0
The Sound of Music,"This was probably ""the"" first blockbuster of my movie viewing period. I remember at the Academy Theater in downtown Minneapolis, it was the only movie that showed for over a year. People would come back to the small town I lived in and rave about. Because I was a kid with little money and no chance to tool around the big city, I didn't get to see it until it finished its initial run and made it out into the hinterlands. It was breathtaking on wide screen. That opening scene is really impressive. Everybody knows every song. Julie Andrews has always defined perkiness and energy and she carries it off magnificently. There is something missing somewhere. Despite all the great songs, the threat that was Naziism never quite comes through. They are there and they are the worst of the worst, but we never quite feel their power. Even the scene at the Abbey is a little hokey. Watching ""Cabaret"" which is certainly a totally different take, you see what these monsters could be. It is a musical with a little more depth, though not as mainstream. Still, how can you pass on the wonderful songs, the awesome production numbers, the visions of Austria, parading before us. It's a really good movie. I never quite got to the ""great"" part.",1,0,1,-1,1,0,0
The Sound of Music,"just lovely. for the special mixture of a story, performances and landscape. for the songs, humor and tension. for a kind of magic who reminds value of small things and basic values. for its simplicity and for the right science to present a real drama in subtle manner of a trip in heart of an Austrian family. it is a strange case - so well known and so new at the each new view. explanation is the delicate measure. and the hard work to use the importance of each detail. a film about love. charming, nice. and, maybe more important, lovely. the songs are more than parts of old ages. the transformation of the father always, in different manner, a surprise. a film who could be discovered with irony. but it remains not just a classic but a sentimental adventure for its public.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1
The Sound of Music,"I come here to review ""The Sound of Music"", not to praise it. Yes, like the billions of other fans, I have seen this so many times I pretty much know it by heart. Like ""The Wizard of Oz"", I have seen it both on television and the big screen, and have decided that for at least the next 10 years, I am leaving it alone. Still, one cannot forget about it, no matter how hard one tries. With sing-along showings of it at the Hollywood Bowl, constant dredging up at piano bars and the many spoofs it has received, ""The Sound of Music"" has not died in my heart, just become momentarily dormant.I actually prefer the stage version (a 1995 revival) to the movie, as it was not overloaded with helicopter covered shots of the Alps or constant liederhosen clad kids, and basically stuck to the flour of the story rather than the frosting. Yet, there is something unshakable of Julie Andrews in her second big ""Nanny"" film as Maria Rainer Von Trapp, the former postulate who ends up marrying her employer and helps him escape from the Nazis.In the first dozen times I saw this, I of course was overwhelmed by the helicopter shot of the Alps that eventually closes in on Julie twirling around the mountainside. What I did miss was the opening verse of the title song, sung so simply by Mary Martin in the 1959 original and Rebecca Luker decades later. The opening is equivalent to that of director Robert Wise's other big movie musical, ""West Side Story"", even if the locations and mood are as far from each other as they can get. When the nuns sing of their issues with Maria (which includes a future ""General Hospital"" legend, Anna Lee, as well as movie musical dubber Marni Nixon), I am in delight, because like those nuns, I too am conflicted by her. So how will she deal with the seven bratty children of Captain Von Trapp (Christopher Plummer) and his whistle blowing and his baroness fiancée (a cynical Eleanor Parker)? This sweet set-up, though, has serious overtones as World War II is blooming as much as the edelweiss, and after Maria and the Captain fall in love, the world changes from teaching the kids the notes to sing to finding a way to get out a country that while beautiful on the outside is in danger of becoming ugly on the inside. This changes the second half of the film (as it did the play) from a learning experience for all of these characters to a survival lesson where they must struggle to ""Climb Every Mountain"".Somewhat overproduced and certainly extremely long, it is still a crowd- pleaser that I can't recommend highly enough. Yes, my rating is not a ""10"", but that's from possibly too many viewings, sometimes too soon. Everybody shines in the film, although in a few particular moments, Plummer's phrasing and delivery of his dialog seems a bit awkward. It's nice to see Richard Haydn playing a character not as annoying as those he did in ""The Late George Apley"" and ""Sitting Pretty""; He's obviously an opportunist and not afraid to admit it, yet in a few spots, shows definite heroism. Parker gets some great bitchy lines to deliver and adds some needed salt into the sugary proceedings.The heart and soul of the film, though, is Peggy Wood's Mother Superior, the equivalent in Rodgers and Hammerstein's cavalcade to ""Oklahoma's"" Aunt Eller, ""Carousel's"" Nettie, ""South Pacific's"" Bloody Mary and ""The King and I's"" Madame Thiang. She's not without some imperfections, and when she barrels out her line, ""Are you in love with him?"", it seems as if she's looking for a good piece of gossip. But when Anna Lee and Portia Nelson (later ""All My Children's"" long-time baby sitter Mrs. Gurney) admit they have sinned, her reaction is priceless and a proper send-off. ""Family Guy"" crudely spoofed this scene years later.As for Julie Andrews, how can you not like her? She didn't get to repeat her Broadway roles at all, but fortunately 20th Century Fox got her for this, and I must say, her Maria is certainly more appealing as a Nanny than her Mary Poppins. It's obvious that she loves these children, is humble and far from the other worldly creature of the role for which she had just won an Oscar.",0,1,1,0,1,1,0
The Sound of Music,".. but me on the other hand, I didn't! And it's not because of bad film-making or anything like that. It just has to do with the fact, that the ""music"" and ""singing"" part, that I just didn't like at all! Yes I know, that's why it's called musical, but I saw the movie without any prior knowledge of what it's about or what genre it is, I just knew, that it's genuinely seen as a classic all over the world by many people.The story per se is also a good one, but with all the singing and dancing it felt too long. I do not want to affront anyone who's in love with this movie (we all have our own taste and that's a good thing), I'm just saying, that this movie was not getting to me ... at all! If you on the other hand, like drama (plus the musical part of it), all in a long movie, than you probably should watch this, if you haven't already!

The Sound of Music,"I took me over 30 years to finally watch this film, something I did in 1998....and I could see why this is such a beloved film. I watched it one other time, about five years later on DVD, but didn't enjoy it as much and traded it for something else. However, I still have a high regard for the film. The film is a throwback to something you might see in the 1930s or '40s - a super-nice, old-fashioned movie led by Julie Andrews, who probably never again looked as pretty and wholesome as she did here. In fact, her image from this was so squeaky-clean that she went out of her way to play some sleazy parts in coming years. Too bad. At least here, she's a joy to watch. The kids are all nice, attractive and well-behaved, something else you don't see much anymore on film. Christopher Plummer is the male lead and once he loosens up, he's fine, too, as is the usually-funny Richard Haydn. Even the bad guys in this film - the Nazis (which include Eleanor Parker) - aren't prevalent. They don't have a lot of scenes in here even though they are an integral part to the story.The film is nicely photographed, too, and I don't mean just the Austrian Alps.I did think there were too many songs in here, something of them done twice. That's too much. Maybe that's what made me think two viewings were enough. (I'm not big into musicals.) On my second viewing, for some reason, I found the movie too boring in too many spots, which means a number of them since it's almost three hours long in total. It was slow-starting and I just couldn't get into it. I am glad at least I could enjoy this once.",1,1,0,1,0,1,1
The Sound of Music,"Wholesome woman leaves Austrian convent and goes to be governess for a captain's children right before the Nazis take over Austria. Go figure! As it was, I spent most of ""The Sound of Music"" throwing out the sort of comments that Mike, Servo and Crow hurl at the grade-Z movies that Dr. Forrester sends them on ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"". Seeing Christopher Plummer - who apparently called the movie ""The Sound of Mucus"" - I thought to myself: ""So that's the guy from 'The Return of the Pink Panther', 'Dragnet', 'Dolores Claiborne', 'The Insider' and 'Syriana'?"" As for Julie Andrews, she basically reprises her ""Mary Poppins"" role. And considering that it was Austria, we now probably will think that someone could have just gotten Arnold Schwarzenegger to come in and kick Nazi booty.For the record, one of the ""Simpsons"" comic books had Sideshow Bob and his brother Cecil spoofing famous musicals (including this one) with songs about killing Bart Simpson. And I read that after the Von Trapps fled Europe, they eventually settled in Vermont. I wonder, could Maria have gotten to know Ben & Jerry? Anyway, ""TSOM"" isn't terrible; it just seems so hokey in the 21st century. I personally prefer to remember Robert Wise (RIP) for ""West Side Story"".",1,1,1,1,1,1,1
The Sound of Music,"It has been hailed as the greatest musical of all time, it has been on TV every year (especially at Christmas), and it is still one of the most seen films in cinema, based on the hit Broadway musical by Rodgers and Hammerstein (composer by Richard Rodgers and lyricist Oscar Hammerstein II), from Oscar winning, and Golden Globe nominated director Robert Wise (The Day the Earth Stood Still). The film begins with the spinning and singing ""The Hills Are Alive"" from Maria (Golden Globe winning, and Oscar and BAFTA nominated Dame Julie Andrews). She is the nun sent by Mother Abbess (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Peggy Wood) to the Von Trapp family to become the new governess, mainly to look after the seven children of Captain Georg Von Trapp (Christopher Plummer). As the story goes, Maria falls in love with the wonderful children, Georg turns from grouchy to cheerful, and of course, he and Maria get married. The film is not all happy though, it is after the wedding that you are reminded of the time period the film is based in, World War II, where Georg refuses to be part of the war, and the concluding scenes have the family escaping the Nazis through the monastery.

The Sound of Music,"When I was a kid, maybe ten or eleven years old, I was tapped to be a stagehand in an amateur teen production of ""The Sound of Music"". This would have been a few years before the movie came out. It was a cool gig, getting to hang out with and watch the older kids. My main job was to help raise and lower the stage curtain, too much for somebody my size so I was teamed up with someone else. There was even a bit part for me in the play in some dance scene where I had to actually touch some yucky girl. I'm glad I outgrew that foolish tendency.That was when I was first introduced to the music of Rodgers and Hammerstein, and it didn't take long to learn the words to now popular standards like Do Re Mi, Favorite Things and Edelweiss, not to mention the title song. Curiously, I was never moved to watch the film version of ""The Sound of Music"" until recently. My loss, as this is a wonderful family film for all ages, even if part of it it deals with the largely unspoken terror of Nazi occupation in Austria. That theme is jarringly brought home with the first utterance of 'Heil Hitler' by the bureaucratic Herr Zeller, and sets the backdrop for the film's finale as the Von Trapp family flees their homeland.For all of that, the film serves quite well as an entertaining musical, with elements of comedy mixed in as student nun Maria (Julie Andrews) becomes governess for a widower naval captain (Christopher Plummer) with seven children. By dint of common sense and humility, Maria gains the respect and love of the entire family, eventually falling in love herself, with a man she probably would not have sought out under normal circumstances. In a touching scene, the Reverend Mother helps Maria sort out her conflicted feelings and return to the Von Trapp household. For my part, I thought the Baroness Schraeder (Eleanor Parker) was way too gracious in her understanding of the Captain's true feelings, and in her case, discretion was truly the better part of valor.Fans of movie musicals will certainly find ""The Sound of Music"" at or near the top of their favorite films list. Filling it's nearly three hour run time are a host of wonderful songs, many to my surprise which were done more than once.

Julie Andrews is back as another nanny (or, governess) to rambunctious children (this time 7), but her magical powers are confined to a guitar and a lilting soprano.

Cast as Maria, a novice hired away from the convent, Julie isn't always the jovial Mary Poppins here; she's rather stern and overly precise, and when she returns as Plummer's wife, there's an awkward chasm between she and the family, as if they're asking, ""Who is this new person?""

The Sound of Music,"Despite its historical inaccuracies, ""The Sound of Music"" is an outstanding film.I never forgave Rex Harrison for opening up the best actress envelope and quickly saying the winner is Julie...and then pausing. He looked right into the eyes of Julie Andrews and said...Christie for ""Darling.""Note that I said inaccuracy. As an historian, I would be remiss if I neglected to mention that Maria did not marry Georg Von Trapp in 1938 as the film suggests. They wed in the 1920s. In fact, by '38, as the anschluss engulfed Austria, the Von Trapp children were mostly grown. One son had just graduated from medical school.With this inaccuracy, we still have a glorious film about a singing family and a woman who came one summer as their governess and wound up marrying the widower.Julie Andrews is just picture perfect as Maria, the woman, who was not destined to become a nun. Christopher Plummer is excellent as Georg, who loved his children, but whose love had to be brought out by Maria. Eleanor Parker was quite effective as the baroness. She saw Maria as a rival and attempted to get rid of her. When Maria returns, she bowed out gracefully.The cinematography is breathtaking. Austria was never lovelier. The songs are staged beautifully. Who can forget I Have Confidence, Going on 16,and My Favorite Things? It's all glorious. The dancing throughout Austria was marvelously staged by great choreography.The children are just adorable and so memorable. Charmaine Carr, portrays the eldest, Lisle, at age 16. Actually, Miss Carr was 21 when the film was made and Julie Andrews was 28!Too little credit is given to Marnie Nixon, who portrayed Sister Sophia. Few people knew that she did all the singing for the nuns in the rendition of How Do You Solve A Problem Like Maria? She even sang for Peggy Wood in the latter's rendition of Climb Every Mountain. Miss Nixon, who sang for so many of the stars in films, was never given the credit she so aptly deserved.Norma Varden, known for playing erudite women in smaller roles, played Frau Schmidt, the housekeeper. Few people know that Miss Varden was set to play the Peggy Wood role of Mother Superior. At the last moment, Miss Varden was replaced by Wood.Go see this film over and over. The chemistry between Andrews and Plummer is terrific.Richard Haydn, as the music impresario is great. His line of ""how many men that you know confer with their children on their honeymoon"" was memorable. Ben Wright made for a wonderful villain who later becomes the town's gauleiter after the anschluss takes place.A film for all occasions, never to be missed.",1,1,1,0,1,1,1
The Sound of Music,"The Sound Of Music is a musical film that was adapted on screen from the Broadway musical of the same name with the songs written by Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II.It stars Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer as Maria and Captain Georg von Trapp respectively together with Eleanor Parker as Baroness Elsa von Schraeder who was the Captain's lady friend and a competition for Maria;Richard Haydn as Max Detweiler, a good friend of both the Baroness and the Captain; as well as Charmian Carr,Nicholas Hammond,Heather Menzies,Duane Chase,Angela Cartwright,Debbie Turner and Kym Karath as the Von Trapp children.Robert Wise directed this classic musical film.It is about the story of the von Trapp family singers.Maria is a young woman who gets into the consternation of the nuns in an Austrian convent.This prompted Mother Abbess to send her to become a governess for the seven children of a naval officer and widower,Captain Georg von Trapp.It later leads a romance between Maria and the captain that leads to marriage.The children who happen to be talented singers also joins the Salzburg Music Festival during their honeymoon.It contains several popular songs, including ""Edelweiss"", ""My Favorite Things"", ""Climb Ev'ry Mountain"", ""Do-Re- Mi"", ""Sixteen Going on Seventeen"", ""The Lonely Goatherd"", and the title song, ""The Sound of Music"".It concludes when the von Trapp family escapes from Austria to Switzerland before the Germans annexes the country.It has been more than 50 years since the musical was released.Throughout all these years,it has remained popular.The songs would still provide delight to the viewers today and remains byword to many.The songs definitely provided a lot of joy and entertainment for they are definitely Rodgers and Hammerstein's best scores.But it is great to note how wonderful Julie Andrews was in it as Maria for she lights up the screen all throughout.She definitely can warm a lot of hearts throughout the generation when watching it.Aside from the songs,it also has everything that one wants to see in a movie like love;a love triangle between Maria,the Captain and the Baroness;children;great cinematography;great European locations;religion;comedy;war and intrigue.

Most of it is far worse than I remembered. I mean both that the cinematic methods seemed more tired now that we can see how limited it is. I also mean that the thing within, the story is meaningless. Is this how we think of falling in love today? Probably film romance comes through just as small an aperture now, but the notion here seems too direct.But it was also a surprise. There's one scene I had to watch over and over again. Its the scene where they give a puppet show to ""The Lonely Goatherd."" Its absolutely amazing, everything about it. Especially notable is the visual rhythm which is composed unlike anything else in the project and I assume was shot and edited by a different crew.Its a performance of a performance, which makes it unlike the rest of the film. The pace is managed differently for each of the three levels: puppeteers, puppets and viewers, but each pace is integrated into the others.

The Sound of Music,"What can one say about a film that now, as it gears towards its next anniversary of a 50th birthday, is loved and adored by so many? It feels, to me at least, kind of redundant trying to even write a review of it now. So really I just want to say that as a mid-forties cinema loving man I revisited the film recently for the first time in about 15 years and found it still had a magical kind of hold over me. Yes I still think it's too long, but ask me what I would cut out of the film and I'm at a bit of a loss to answer.Over the last thirty years or so it has become something of a focal point for parody, somewhat diminishing the actual film's first time appeal. Then there are the charges of it being hackneyed, but they are misplaced and very unfair for The Sound Of Music is an ode to life and music, nothing remotely hackneyed there me thinks. Bookended by stunning Salzburg scenery {seriously the opening helicopter sequence is breath taking}, the rest in between is a series of brilliant set pieces and some unforgettable Rodgers & Hammerstein tunes. Led by Julie Andrews & Christoher Plummer, the cast delight throughout. Yes, not everyone is note perfect, but it's a moot point really. As a guy it's at the one hour ten mark where I get something to hang my coat upon, from there on in the Von Trapp family, and their gorgeous governess, have me hook, line & sinker.

The Sound of Music,"The only reason for watching again this 1965 musical was the new release of the Blu-Ray DVD. Having seen at a young age the wonderful Broadway production starring Mary Martin and Theodore Bikel, the movie version that followed greatly enhanced a work, that in its own merit, didn't need any improvement. As directed by Robert Wise, right after his triumphant ""West Side Story"", we were stunned to see how the director had opened up the film by placing the action just where it was supposed to have been taken place, the cinematic and gorgeous Salzburg.The new version we just saw is as splendid as when the film was originally released, but somehow in second viewing, we started to notice how sadly it has aged. Our first impression was much better than on second viewing because the original seemed larger than life. In fact, our copy of the film, even with the fine restoration cannot compare with the sensation of watching in a wide screen, which we believe was at the old Roxy where it played for quite a long time. Those were the days of exclusive engagements and this film qualified for it big time! Julie Andrews was at one of the highest points of her career, and as Maria her contribution to the overall enjoyment is invaluable. Christopher Plummer was an ideal Capt. Von Trapp. Eleanor Parker's Baroness has enough parts of charm and bitchiness seeing her man stolen by a novice in charge of those brats she would have inherited had she married the Captain.The real star of this production was Salzburg, that beautiful Austrian city that has kept its charm throughout history and the surrounding countryside is breathtaking. The film owes a lot to its cinematographer Ted McCourd who captured the magnificent locale in such a loving way. The music of Rogers and Hammerstein blends well within the context of the picture. It is a tribute to Robert Wise this film has endured the passing of time.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1
The Sound of Music,"Not even the overwhelmingly gorgeous scenery of the Alps can dwarf Julie Andrews' contribution to 'The Sound of Music'. She outshines the scenery and delivers what is probably the best performance by an actress in a screen musical--ever!! This fact is made even more impressive by the fact that the role was originally played on Broadway by Mary Martin--no slouch herself when it comes to musical stardom.Fortunately, under Robert Wise's magnificent direction, she is surrounded by top talent, all shown to great advantage in highly suitable roles. Richard Haydn as the Von Trapp manager almost steals every scene he's in; Christopher Plummer does a sly job as the tough as nails patriarch whose heart is melted by the charming governess; and Eleanor Parker does a magnificent job as the Countess, who, during one of the children's spontaneous home concerts, observes wryly: ""Why didn't you tell me to bring my harmonica?""And the children, of course, are all scene stealers. The final concert is staged for dramatic effect and pushes the movie toward its suspense-filled climax before the successful exit over the Alps. All of the numbers, in fact, are brilliantly staged--whether indoors or outdoors--and the movie spins along at a fast and merry clip.Sugar-coated? Sure. But given all the plus factors--including that brilliant Rodgers and Hammerstein score--how can anyone complain? A film of undeniable charm and beauty--visually and vocally--a treat for the whole family.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1
The Sound of Music,"Based on a real life story. This takes place in Salzburg, Austria in 1939. Captain Von Trapp (Christopher Plummer) needs a governess to help control his seven children whose mother has died. The captain is VERY stern and treats his children like slaves. Maria (Julie Andrews) a nun is hired for the job. She quickly tames the children and has them singing. She even gets through to the captain. However he is engaged to be married to an evil Baroness (Eleanor Parker) who just wants him for his money.Beautiful scenery, great songs and a wonderful performance by Andrews. Sure it's syrupy and TOO sweet but I find it irresistible. The three hours just fly by whenever I see it. Andrews is wonderful and all the kids are OK. Parker does what she can in the evil woman role. The only real debit here is Plummer. He didn't want to do it and that comes through loud and clear. He called it ""The Sound of Mucus"" and complained about his singing voice being dubbed. So his performance is bad but it doesn't ruin the movie.All in all I LOVE this movie and heartily recommend it. Best part: Peggy Wood as the Mother Abbess belting out ""Climb Every Mountain"".",1,0,1,0,1,0,1
The Sound of Music,"Most people are afraid to admit it but ""The Sound of Music"" remains one of the best and most classic musical movies ever made. I would also say that this is an almost perfect example of the genre but let me put some more emphasis on the word almost.Honestly, you could you not like this movie? It's cheerful, colorful and very charming. It's set in great colorful environments, features a sort of simple, no-worries type of story (untill its final 30 minutes) and some great and very memorable songs. It's a movie that can really lift your mood while watching it.To me this actually seems like a movie that can best be seen on the large silver screen. The nature environments, the sets, the colors, the camera-work, it all deserves to be seen on a large screen and it will make the movie no doubt look even better than it already does on an average sized television. There are still plenty of screening every year, so if you get the opportunity I really would recommend you to see this movie on the silver screen.Yes, it's a long sit, since the movie is almost 3 hours long but the movie is definitely worth it. It still is a bit odd to me though, that no matter how long the movie is, its ending still feels very rushed. Seriously, the whole WW II aspects got hardly mentioned at all in the first 2 hours of the movie and then boom! Suddenly there is a war going on. There is no real good build-up to it in its story, which in my opinion seems like a bit of a missed opportunity. The final 30 minutes feel really crammed in and rushed. Besides, in my opinion the movie never really reaches a fully satisfying conclusion. It still leaves a lot of questions open and has some loose ends in it, as if they were perhaps expecting to make a sequel to this movie some day.But this is not the only problem I had with the second half of the movie. I was really liking the movie for its cheerful atmosphere and uplifting story and characters but I did not at all see it's love story coming up. To me there was absolutely nothing at all that indicated that Maria and Captain Von Trapp were falling for each other and that these two persons were meant to be together. I was actually quite happy about it that for a change this looked to be a musical in which the two main characters wouldn't fall in love with each other. It pretty much came out of nowhere for me and it just didn't seemed to be something that this movie and its story needed.No complaints about the acting obviously. It still is Julie Andrews' most iconic and memorable role and Christopher Plummer also did a pretty good job. You probably wouldn't had recognized him, since he's still so very young and different looking in this movie. Can't also really complain about the child cast, though I should say that's its just a bit odd that none of the children really look alike. The one has blond hair and blue eyes, while the other dark hair with brown eyes. None of them really look they could be brothers or sisters in real life. But of course I understand that it would had been quite hard to find 7, singing, dancing and acting children, that also all look alike as well.With this movie Robert Wise once more showed his amazing versatility and talent as a director. Seriously, is there any genre this guy hasn't worked in? He of course had some practice already, with his other much acclaimed musical ""West Side Story"". But even when looking at just these two movies you'll notice how much different they actually are in its style and approach. Again, also this really shows how incredibly versatility and talented as a director Robert Wise was.All in all this remains a nearly perfect musical movie, that despite all my criticism of it, really remains a great and truly enjoyable watch.8/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",1,-1,-1,1,1,1,1
The Sound of Music,"Every bit the classic it is made out to be. I am not a fan of musicals, but this is great. The scenes flow into the music seamlessly and perfectly. Just about every song sticks pleasantly in your head. Plot is fairly basic, but good. Direction by Robert Wise is spot-on. Cinematography is spectacular. The Austrian mountainscapes are amazingly beautiful and provide the perfect backdrop.Performances by Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer are great. The kids are mostly unconvincing and overly sweet though.A movie everyone should watch.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1
The Sound of Music,"""The Sound of Music"" is easy to ridicule. It's sappy, corny and sentimental to the extreme. It hopelessly simplifies horrible world events, and makes it seem like all anyone needed to do to escape the iron fist of Hitler's regime was to schlep over some hills on a bright, sunny morning and say ""hello"" to Switzerland. But I'm still recommending this movie, because it is one of the most accomplished movie musicals ever made.Robert Wise knew how to make a stage musical feel cinematic on the screen, as evidenced here and by his earlier ""West Side Story."" He could open up stage musicals so that they felt right at home on screen, and he was expert at using on-location photography to enhance material rather than highlight its limitations. In ""Music,"" the Austrian scenery is dazzling, and nearly becomes a character in itself. And the music sounds great, though it's not one of Rodger's & Hammerstein's best scores (it falls well below ""The King and I"" and ""Carousel."") Julie Andrews is perfect in the lead role; I can't imagine anyone else playing Maria. She had a knack for toning down overly-sentimental material until it almost became believable. And Eleanor Parker is the other stand out in the cast as the hilarious Baroness Schrader. My favorite moment comes when the family has burst into song for the umpteenth time and she leans over to Max (Richard Haydn) and whispers sarcastically, ""Why didn't you tell me to bring along my harmonica?"" I forgive anyone who thinks this movie is just too gag-inducing to bear, but I still get some pleasure from popping it in every now and then.Grade: A-",1,1,0,0,1,1,1
The Sound of Music,"The Sound of Music (1965): Dir: Robert Wise / Cast: Julie Andrews, Christopher Plummer, Eleanor Parker, Richard Haydn, Peggy Wood: Wondrous expression of peace within darkness. Set in 1938 with the Nazis closing in on Austria, the story centres on free spirited Maria whom the nuns fear doesn't quite fit in. She is sent to oversee the seven children of former Naval officer Captain von Trapp. He is a widow who uses strict military discipline on the children, who respond by rebelling against every nanny hired. Maria holds strong allowing her friendly patient demeanor to win the children over. Eventually von Trapp is also won over when he overhears her influence through his children singing a song she taught them. They are soon sought after to sing at an event that has Nazis in attendance. Wonderful music full of life and joy, flawed only by the underdeveloped personalities of the children. Robert Wise previously had musical success with West Side Story but goes beyond that here. As in Mary Poppins, Julie Andrews shines as a nanny but of a different nature here. Christopher Plummer as von Trapp learns the importance of family. Eleanor Parker plays a wealthy potential wife to von Trapp. Richard Haydn plays an uncle arranging a play, and Peggy Wood plays the head nun. Theme demonstrates the ability to prevail through harsh times when the sound of music conquers opposing factors. Score: 9 / 10",1,1,1,0,1,0,0

Grey's Anatomy,"This new to 2005 TV series focuses on the lives of a group of young, new surgical residents in Seattle. The title character is Dr. Meredith Grey, whose mother, now in early dementia, was a renowned surgeon. The young Dr. Grey is played by Ellen Pompeo, a fairly experienced young actress who has a face that is more interesting than beautiful, but her acting is believable, making her a good choice for the role. All the others think she may be getting preferred treatment, but we see that she appears to be a gifted doctor.The good ensemble cast includes quite a few, but I have three other favorites. Sandra Oh plays Dr. Yang, ambitious, always trying to get picked to assist in surgery, and in recent episodes has begun a clandestine affair with Dr Burke (Houstonian Isaiah Washington), one of members of the surgical team. The other is Chandra Burke, another Houstonian, as the 'nazi' Dr. Miranda Bailey. She is in charge of the new residents, and makes them understand early that when she is sleeping, they should only disturb her if someone is on the verge of death. She really is a good and kind character, but she has to play it tough to establish boundaries.So far I have only seen two or three episodes, but they have been interesting, well-written, and well-acted. Not the usual ""doctor"" soap series.",1,1,1,0,0,1,0
Grey's Anatomy,"I thought this show was going to be around first year interns at a Seattle Hospital. I wasn't expecting Meredith Grey to be the central character. I love watching Sandra Oh and Patrick Dempsey. They are both excellent actors themselves. With the success of Sideways, Sandra can be singing all the way to the bank. She is very entertaining to watch even in this show. I would say this is an average show. I like the fact that Meredith is the daughter of a famous surgeon who now does not remember her own name possibly from Alzheimer's disease. I do not understand networks who keep trying to use the same familiar surroundings like a hospital or a police station in dramas. There are too many dramas on today. I would much rather have something original. Since it comes after Desperate Housewives, it is not a bad show. It just needs time to grow. There are good episodes sometimes but I think the characters are so involved in their personal love lives that they have forgotten medicine sometimes. I don't think this show is evolving appropriately to combine love, medicine, story lines, and a mixture of it equally. I love Kate Burton who appears as Ellis Grey, Meredith's mother.

Grey's Anatomy,"I remember a time before I watched Grey's Anatomy. My Mum and sister would be watching it and I'd be like, ""Why are you watching this crap?"", but then one day, when I had nothing new to watch, I borrowed my sister's Season 1 DVD and it turned out that I really liked it. Since then, I've been a huge fan. And thankfully, it was about to start airing the ninth season, so I had a lot to catch up. As we speak I'm dreading that it won't be renewed for a twelfth season, but I'm praying that it will be. I honestly can't believe how much hate this show got a couple of weeks ago when they killed of Derek. I mean, I was sad, but come on people, it's a TV show. Get over it. Throughout this show at least ten major characters have come and gone. It's bound to happen again. My favorite season is probably Season 6, because Arizona and all the Mercy West people are main characters, which I loved. My favorite relationship is probably Alex and Jo, but that's not until like the tenth season.This show takes place in Seattle, Washington, in a hospital. We see our main characters go through residency starting out as interns and then becoming attendings. We see people we love leave or die, and we see new relationships bloom as new characters come in. This show seriously made me think about becoming a surgeon, even though I know it's not completely realistic. I mean the doctors wear long sleeves and watches, which in a real hospital, they're not allowed to. But it didn't matter anyway, because I honestly don't have the brain capacity to remember all of those surgeries.

Grey's Anatomy,"When I began watching Grey's Anatomy I was single, dating and connected with the first round of characters that the show offered its audience. We were along for the journey with these young Doctors as they began their professional careers as well as their personal struggles with friendship and love. Fourteen seasons later, Grey's Anatomy has become a completely different show as we the audience has also changed. I am now married with children and at a similar time-line as some of the current cast members. It is for this reason that I am no longer a devoted fan. Having seen every episode since its pilot, I have finally questioned why I am still tuning in every week to watch the continuing adventures of Meredith Grey and her circle of friends and fellow doctors. Simple, it is no longer the same show I began to watch 14 seasons ago. Most of the character of the original show have left if not been killed off. The hospital has been set on fire, blown up, and taken hostage multiple times. We have seen love, lost, passion, promise, joy and sadness from multiple story lines throughout its run. Grey's Anatomy has reinvented itself so many times that we have seen its central figure (Meredith Grey) change for good and bad. From the single girl, the devoted daughter, the young doctor, the passionate girl friend, the on again off again good / bad friend, the angry daughter living in her Mom' shadow, the newly-wed, young mother, widower, lost adult and now, for lack of anything else, a supporting character to the show that graces her name. For this reason and the loss of so many of its prior cast members, I have found myself question time and time again when Grey's Anatomy ""jumped the shark."" Grey's Anatomy by default has inherited the generational audience of fans from such shows as St. Elsewhere, Chicago Hope and ER. The hospital drama has a home with Grey's Anatomy. When the show began, it was a home to a young cast of young professionals that were in multiple ""sexual"" relationships as they juggled their careers and side stories. Also, the show has taken a life of its own by juggling a much more diverse cast then it set out originally. With good and bad results, the solid fact remains that the current show does not reflect anything that the original show set out to be 14 seasons ago. While the show has created a multitude of amazing stories and moments for its audience to enjoy, I have lost that love and feeling many years ago. Now, I fear that after many years of hoping, wishing and praying, the show will not return to what it once was. It has tried several times to revive its cast to showcase this but has failed. Even during its second and third wind of new medical arrivals, only a handful have made the cut to the current cast while the large majority have disappeared if not written off the show. However, I am not angry at the overall show. Grey' Anatomy has (had) produced many good characters and stories back in the day. Thank you for the good times, which were many many seasons ago. Now, audience members have to make a tough decision. With that said, the show has struggled for an identity while holding onto several different aspects for a show. It has taken me this long to finally ""pull the plug"" and take Grey's Anatomy off of life support.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1

Okay...I am not too naive to believe that this is more than television...and entertainment drama...and much poetic license is taken upon each episode regarding medical actions...but none of these folks make me feel comfortable about ever going into a hospital - interns or doctors.Many of the lead characters are unbelievably attractive...so pouty...so conflicted...so stereotypical!Human? Well, would I really care about their personal conflicts if I was ill and needed medical service?!?!? No. But since this is a television series, the thing is....do I care about watching their lives week after week?

These folks even speak slow...it's so slow, I can almost see the script.And stereotypical characters? You bet. The loud mouth angry African American woman with a secret heart of gold, the over achieving Asian(s), the cute Causaion male doctor everyone wants, the moody doctors, the old hats, the ex-models who got a TV role, sex in the closet (well, substitute ""closet"" for any room or space) during work hours...and on and on and on and on...I am disappointed in this kind of television fare. ABC is getting worse and worse with it. This program is not an intelligent one, it's not entertaining and it doesn't make me excited or want to champion for any of these folks.

Grey's Anatomy,"This is another one of those shows I watched that is designed for women. The obvious giveaway is that there are none of them boring explosions; or really yawn-invoking shoot-outs; or any of those nasty, hard-to-put-down-hospital-zombies I like so much. I did observe that this show is not really based on any one big plot, but lends itself more to the strengths of many smaller plots (let's call them 'plottets'). Each show embraces one or more of these sub-plots and navigate through the latest stages of the respective plottet's life-cycle(s). No matter how much my ears may bleed from show-generated headaches, this program obviously is well-scripted which is reflected in the loyal fan-base. By the way - the use of the word 'planted' is intended as a good segway into some really cool gardening analogy I dreamed up. Without further ado let's start banging that gardening drum right away. Like the vegetables in a year-round garden, each plottet will rot sooner than another. Also, like the more popular veggies, these mini-plots may attract more interest than originally planned. When this happens, the subject is magically revitalized or resuscitated – whatever the case may be. Keeping with that gardening analogy, this is kind of like when you try jamming the root ball back into the ground hoping you haven't mistakenly killed your favorite Big Tom tomato plant. Like any garden at the end of its growing year, all weeds are yanked or tear-wrenching story lines are resolved (half with happy endings and the other half with terrible endings) – and newer and sadder plottets are introduced – or the garden is freshly seeded. Anyways – I know that any attempt to understand these mini-plots would be very detrimental to my health and quite pointless. I just don't have the will to figure this stuff out. For women, I can understand why they like this stuff – it is just so REAL! I will hand kudos the writers. The use of these mini-plots is very clever. Not only do they trap audiences into watching weekly in order to follow each plottet, but it also arms fans with powerful knowledge (very powerful – Svengali-like - knowledge) which can be used as a reference point in fan discussions about character direction in the show.

Grey's Anatomy,"The Network From Nowhere really knocked me for a loop by smacking the viewing audience upside its collective head with THREE strong series that came out winners: ""Desperate Housewives"" and ""LOST"" being the first two.Now that we are well into the second season for both of those, and their story arcs are looking a little 'iffy', it's the third and most surprising contender, ""Grey's Anatomy"", that looks to be the strongest of the bunch. As the follow-up riding on ""Housewives'"" coattails, I was ready to dismiss it outright as ""Ally McBeal in hospital scrubs."" But not having much else to watch in that time slot, I decided to give it a try, and was I pleasantly shocked! Though there ARE some moments where the principal characters come off as self-centered, neurotic and at times downright eccentric, it never reached the level of absurdity that ""Ally"" often did, and thank God for that! Ellen Pompeo as Dr. Meredith Grey comes off as likable and probably more self-aware and introspective than self-absorbed and scatterbrained, though there are moments you do want to reach into the screen and give her a good shaking.And good call on the ensemble casting! You really have to give props to any show that FINALLY figures out how to effectively showcase the sweet-and-sour charms of Sandra Oh, who was good enough to elevate a sow's ear of a show like ""Arli$$,"" if not to save it. And not to mention give assorted actors who have all been great in projects not up to their talents, the chance to really shine in some very well-written roles, and I want to single out Katherine Heigl, Justin Chambers, Chandra Wilson and especially T.R.

It has its mother's pouting lips and smug self indulgence and its father's cinematic style, musical montages and clever narration. Very easy on the ""clever"".""Grey's Anatomy"", in conjunction with the rest of the world, revolves around Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo) and her friends Cristina (Sandra Oh, Sideways), Izzy (Katherine Heigl, who I have a soft spot for after ""Roswell"") and George (T.R. Knight) as they intern at a Seattle hospital, live together in her mother's house and try to survive all-night rounds and their own tumultuous love lives. In all their cases those love lives involve superiors and patients in the hospital (a mixture no better illustrated than in the show's undeniably cool intro). Mom has Alzheimer's. Meredith has a hopeless fling with Dr. Derek Shepard (Patrick Dempsy). Cristina is the stubbornly ambitious cynic who gets involved with surgical resident Dr. Burke (Isaiah Washington). George has a hopeless crush on Meredith.People love it and that's fine. ""Anatomy"" is the media's new ""Friends"": a show that is so popular with the public that no print publication will dare criticize it for fear of loosing readership. It is time to invoke the privilege of writing a free internet review and say that I think ""Anatomy"" is a poorly written, shamefully manipulative, completely derivative and utterly witless piece of trash. That's right, USA Today, poorly written trash. How, again is it clever or witty writing that the interns give their superiors cute little nicknames like ""the Nazi"" or ""McDreamy""? Get it? She's mean. He's dreamy and he has something to do with McDonald's? There is a perfect example of a bit, like many in this show, that feels like someone taking a shot-in-the-dark guess at what a witty person might say.Some shows convey intelligence through stupidity or using a shallow idea as sucker bait to bring in the audience and then hit them with a deeper one. ""South Park"" is the best example of this. ""Penn & Teller: Bullshit"" is another. ""Grey's Anatomy"" is as close to the opposite of that that I have ever seen: stupidity through intelligence, or the appearance of intelligence by using all the mechanical means we have been conditioned to believe makes for a ""good"" show.It is a cinematically shot, and competently put together series. Having studied ""General Hospital"", the works of David E. Kelley, the aforementioned ""Scrubs"" and, hell, even the Gen-x commentary of ""Dead Like Me"", creator Shondra Rhimes mixes all those elements into a rip-off cocktail that looks good (that I will not deny), sounds good and begs us to like it, but is actually saying nothing and not challenging us about anything and has no personality of its own. Forgive me for not being blown away at Meredith's juvenile narrative pontifications. By contrast to George Lass' insightful, dry takes on life, work and society in ""Dead"", the narration in ""Anatomy"" is literally as clever and deep as summing up an entire hour of TV with ""responsibility sucks"".""Anatomy"" fills the void left by the creative death of ""ER"" dealing with doctors on endless shifts who get involved, and sometimes make harrowing choices, in the lives of patients. I can't fault Rhimes for seeing the opportunity and going for it with such gusto. The best episodes revolve around a patient in an absurdly precarious tragedy, like Monica Keena in a memorable guest appearance as a girl from a train accident with a pole in her chest - and the chest of an older man - or the infamous Super Bowl epic ""It's the End of the World As We Know It"" involving Christina Ricci and a body with a live cannon shell in it. But the focus here is upside-down. When lives are at stake and bombs are going off killing people, the show is concerned with Meredith Grey. How is she feeling? Is her dog going to be OK? Pompeo (doing her best Calista Flockhart impression) plays Grey so callously self-absorbed that she never earns the feelings we are supposed to have for her. And because we don't feel for Grey, the rest of the series falls down like a house of cards.The relationship twists and turns? That's the warmed-over part. Could Derek be hiding something? Who will Meredith choose among the two guys who love her? Will Izzy and Alex (Justin Chambers) get together or break up? ""Anatomy"" is so contrived it is insulting, and the story lines get more absurd as it goes. And not in a fun way. Even as a soap, the show feels no compunction about turning on the waterworks, turning up the music to overblown proportions and pouring on the sap and melodrama relentlessly. Just about everything the show does, it does smugly and smarmy. At least ""Desperate Housewives""  which the press has told us we are supposed to hate after the first season  has an understanding and sense of humor about itself.We, ""Grey's Anatomy"" viewers, are being manipulated by a group of show-runners and TV executives who think people will watch anything at all if it has something to do with love and sex. This show pulls out all the tried-and-true stops to impress us, but it is mostly a glossy smoke-screen for writers and show-runners doing hack work, unable to put together a single redeemable character or genuine emotion, to satisfy us without a lot of mental strain.* ½ / 4",1,1,1,1,1,1,1
Grey's Anatomy,"It seems that an eternity has passed , especially after the departure of Derek and Mark from the series.

Vikings,"Review of Season One:VIKINGS is the latest historical drama to reach TV audiences in the wake of the success of SPARTACUS and GAME OF THRONES. This is a low key, somewhat low budget yarn that follows the trials and tribulations of characters living in a small Viking village. It's much like THE WALKING DEAD in that the cast is a small one whose fortunes vary from week to week, rather than an attempt to match the big-bucks complexity of something like TV'S ROME. As usual, sex and violence are the order of the day, alongside political intrigue, backstabbing, treachery, and rivalry.Viewers have been spoilt by the quality of TV writing these days and VIKINGS is no exception. It's a thoughtful and at times intense drama, with a literate script and top-notch historical authenticity. As usual, a cast of unknown actors flesh out the cast and prove to be much better than their more famous Hollywood counterparts. Travis Fimmel plays pretty much the whole thing through his eyes alone and is a delight, but the real treat is Katheryn Winnick, delivering one of the most rounded and feisty female characters seen on TV. Clive Standen, a guy I was at school with, is all brooding intensity and I look forward to seeing how his character develops in future series.Review of Season Two:The second season of VIKINGS is a step up from the first. There's less need for world building here and a greater concentration of intrigue in the form of Ragnar's relationship with his various allies. The frequent travels back and forth to England allow Linus Roache - as the King of Wessex - to really shine and show us what he can do as an actor, although I do feel a little sorry for the development of Athelstan's unlucky character.Some of the plot points in this series are a little repetitive, but the show is so compelling as a whole that it doesn't really matter. The staged action sequences aren't all that imaginative either, but they're well shot with those hyper-fluid characters to give them a documentary look. The acting remains strong throughout, and it's nice to see that VIKINGS hasn't lost its ruthless edge with a truly grisly highlight midway through the show. Onwards and upwards to season three...Review of Season Three:Season Three of the show is a bit of a step down from the previous two outings, although it's not without merit. I just found a lot of whole political situation in England to be more than a little repetitive, despite the continued strong acting of Linus Roache. Ragnar seems to be going through an introspective phase in this series, and doesn't get to do all that much.The series is also rather slow, at least at the outset. The random introduction of the wanderer character played by Kevin Durand doesn't help much. However, once things move to Paris, things get very good; the siege episode contains the best action of the whole show thus far and it's clear that the budget was up to the job. I didn't care too much for some of the subplots, like the one involving Athelstan, but nonetheless this show still has plenty to give and it remains quality viewing, just without the top-quality edge of something like BLACK SAILS.Review of Season Four:The first ten episodes of season four come as a huge disappointment to those who have enjoyed previous series. Everything has changed here, with seemingly more of a budget leading to many extraneous sub-plots and slowed-down main plots. It's as if the writers have gone out of their way to emulate the format of GAME OF THRONES, cutting between various locations (England, Paris, Lagertha's village, Ragnar's home) to provide a breadth of storyline.The problem is that very little happens in the entire ten episodes. Ragnar just sort of hangs out and gets involved with a random Chinese girl who adds nothing to the story whatsoever. Rollo does nothing either, and the scenes set in England are irrelevant. Don't get me wrong, there's still good stuff here; when incident does occur, it's generally assured and exciting. The storming of the tower to rescue the Mercian princess is a highlight, as is the river action centred around Paris towards the end of this half season. But elsewhere this feels dragged out and dumbed down, killing off extraneous characters, adding in sex and intrigue, and feeling very much like treading water.The good news is that the second half of this season is much better and more involving than the first. Ragnar now has a storyline to follow and Travis Fimmel's acting is exemplary, never disappointing for an instant. Linus Roache is in the same situation and gives a very complex portrayal of King Ecbert, a man driven by myriad impulses, desire, and duty. I appreciate the shift of focus on to Ragnar's sons, with each of them becoming a character in their own right, although I did find Lagertha's story lines to be a little silly and out of character for her. The show has reliably strong production values and some good battle sequences, a particularly muddy and vicious bout heavily indebted to a similar battle in GAME OF THRONES.Review of Season Five:Oh dear, this one's the worst yet. I can't help but feel that the series should have ended with the death of Ragnar because this feels really aimless. There are too many minor supporting characters and no major ones of interest, and a real reluctance to bump off any of the too-large cast. Ivar the Bonehead takes up too much screen time without doing anything of note, while Floki has his own sub-plot that goes nowhere and feels like an excuse to give him screen time. The production values remain solid, but when the writing is meandering you know it's time to finish the show.Review of Season Six:The first half of season six carries on the nonsense from season five. There are ridiculous scenes of hot air balloon experiments and a whole bunch of new and interchangeable characters who have none of the interest of the older ones. A few more of the old timers are eventually bumped off, not before time, while the action scenes are by rote and the whole things repetitive and tired. Can't they kill this show off once and for all?",1,1,1,1,1,1,1

Vikings,"Having sat through the first two seasons of ""Vikings"", I must say that I am positively surprised by the production of this TV series. There is a great continuous flow to the storyline throughout the entire first season, although towards the end it starts to become a little bit too much like ""Melrose Place"" with all the intrigue and double-crossing going on. But luckily where as the drama started to run high towards the end of season one, when season two kicks off the show steps away from the melodramatic path it started on towards the end, and go in a whole other direction.Aside from that, then it is a greatly entertaining series. Especially if you are from Scandinavia, which I happen to be. The scenery throughout season one is great, you just got to love the majestic mountains, fjords and forests portrayed here. Odd, though, why it wasn't actually filmed in Norway where it was supposed to take place, but filmed in Ireland.There were some flaws to the show though. First of all, I am pretty sure that they didn't say ""having sex"" back in that period of time. If they had said ""laying with"" or ""bedding"" in stead, it would have been much more accurate and believable. And also, my ancestors didn't speak English with badly-imitated Scandinavian accents. That aspect of the series, albeit acceptable, just brought down the show a notch in its overall believability. Have the vikings speak Norse and the Englishmen speak English.The battle and fighting scenes in the series were alright, although there were moments here and there that were lacking finesse and conviction, where you could see how painfully choreographed the fighting was, as people just stood about waiting for their turn, when there were so obviously openings in the combatants defenses.What really carries the series are the characters. These characters are well-portrayed, and have lots of personalities, traits, depths and are very likable or unlikable. Every single character contributes to something unique to the series. And my personal favorite is Floki, he is just all-through amazing, devious and hilarious. And of course I have to mention the concept of the appearance of the Seer, that was just a stroke of genius. Throughout the first season we get established some fairly alright views into each of the characters, but with season two it just goes one step further, and really delves deeper into the layers of the various characters, which was a really, really great direction for the show to go.As for the actors and actresses and their performances, well they had put together a great ensemble of talents for this series, just a shame that they hadn't opted to go for a full Scandinavian cast, and integrate the proper language more than they had. That whole random switching between Norse and English when the vikings were talking was just not working all that great, but you learn to cope with it, because the show has so much to offer that these minor flaws and moments of irritation fade away.Whether or not you are interested in the Viking era and part of the Scandinavian mythology, then ""Vikings"" is a great show to watch, it is entertaining and really well-produced.I had initially rated ""Vikings"" 7 out of 10 stars after having gotten through season one. But not that season two has come to a close, and with the impressive direction in which the show is progressing, I am upping my rate to an 8 out of 10.",1,1,1,1,0,1,1
Vikings,"(Review updated after Season 6).The story of Ragnar Lothbrok who, in the 9th century, rises from simple farmer to King of the Vikings. Along the way he deals with internal crises, family issues and foreign foes, and discovers a few new lands (and invades them, of course)...Superb drama series, for nearly four seasons. Takes about three episodes to hit its stride and from then never slows down. After that it is a non-stop roller coaster ride of battle scenes, internal and external politics and relationship dramas, all with a large dollop of actual history thrown in. Admittedly, some of the history has been tweaked for dramatic effect, but the basic plot is reasonably accurate.Some good humour too and solid performances.The pinnacle was probably Season 2 where the mix between action and drama was perfectly balanced. Season 3, while still brilliant, edged more towards the action side. By Season 4A, the dial was firmly over on the action side, though the plot was still quite tight.Season 4B was necessary from a closure point of view, and is reasonably emotional for that reason. However, the writing in this season becomes quite sloppy, with incongruous sequences of events and characters behaving inconsistently.The other problem is that the season goes on for several episodes beyond its natural ending. I could see the logic to this - a sort of action and reaction effect and revenge theme - but with the main character gone and the only other character worth supporting (Lagertha) hardly featuring, there is nobody to root for.What's worse, one of the new supposed ""heroes"", Ivar, is pretty obnoxious, something like a cross between Damien of the Omen and Kevin in We Need To Talk About Kevin. Very little engagement left from me, and I was left only watching for the battle scenes (which are very good, by the way).And now, in a jumping the shark moment that lasts 40 episodes, we have Seasons 5 and 6. The show should have ended after Episode 15 of Season 4. Not that the remainder of S4 was bad, it just wasn't necessary or of the same quality that came before.Season 5 was wholly unnecessary and, to crown it all, the writing gets quite weak and sloppy. Engagement is almost non-existent as there's no main characters to root for. Lagertha would be one to support but her screen time is limited and her character gets very one-dimensionally drawn in Season 5. Furthermore, direction becomes pretty much style over substance.Season 6 was more of the same.Ending the series after S4 E15 would have seen this series remembered very fondly and hailed as a dramatic masterpiece. Instead, Vikings joins the list of series that history will remember with less reverence.Season ratings: S1&3: 9/10, S2: 10/10, S4: 8/10, S5&6:5/10",1,1,0,0,0,1,1

Vikings,"Vikings is a highly entertaining yarn that breathes life into the mythological viking leader, Ragnar Lodbrok. The series in no way follows a factual story but does make every effort to acknowledge and reflect the sentiments and attitudes of the times. As such the vikings behave as vikings did, they steal and plunder, they take prisoners as slaves, they butcher the innocent and the defeated alike. Lodbrok is a man of his times. He demonstrates kindness and forgiveness for those he loves but also a practical ruthlessness towards his adversaries. Its nothing personal, its just the way the world he occupies works. Its this historical integrity and the understanding that vikings are at their core conquerors, that makes this series so watchable. The battle scenes are well rendered and plentiful. Its exciting stuff with a thread of intelligently managed intrigue which enhances the quality of the story. The acting is for the most part excellent. Australian Travis Fimmell positively shines as Lodbrok, a role he seems to have been made for. Many of the other characters, especially Gustaf Skarsgård's sly but wise Floki, greatly enhance the viking feel of the series. Nine out of ten from me.",1,1,1,1,0,1,1
Vikings,so I got into this show the other night while hanging out with my aunt (who is already a fan and was doing a refresher marathon in preparation for the season 2 premiere) and I thought it was going to be a snore-fest or something I'd have such a tough time suspending my disbelief for because the actors would look too much like 21st century jokers masquerading and trying sell their poor re-enactments but this was not the case. Everything looks believable and within the limits of what can be shown on basic cable. I am usually not into this sort of dramatic adventure let alone a show that airs on the History channel (unless an actor I like is starring in it) but I definitely will be catching up on the episodes I've missed thus far and joining the fandom for season 2 tomorrow.,1,1,1,0,0,1,0
Vikings,"This was movie gold when it first came out a few years ago. There was plenty of historical drama around of course, but nothing quite this good. The characters, the research into the culture, the photography, the sets, it all made for first-class viewing. I got to really love that intro tune so much, and the graphics, that I rarely skipped it. It was so truthfully appropriate, so good a summary of this strange, honest, brave and violent peoples. I have no criticisms of it, save that until the third series the battles looked a little undermanned. Since Vikings came out I've seen The Last Kingdom and Game of Thrones. Hopefully this marks a new genre in epics that Hollywood can safely pursue.There is one episode where the Viking town await the verdict of a god on the actions of one of their errant members. It was so cool that the 'god' delivered a message that said he found the actions of the man 'interesting' and thus didn't intend to punish him. That habit of Scandinavian honesty weaves throughout this and is refreshing. The plot, along with the script, is first-class. Anyone making a trailer for this show would be spoiled for choice.But I must give a try to a description that sums it up. It's a clever show because it perfectly captures a brand new type of thug arriving in town, and unlike the other thugs, these thugs have no conception that they are thugs whatsoever. Vikings are a fascinating nightmare, which is probably exactly what the people back then thought of them.Oh, and for being roughly historically accurate as well, I for one would like to give this show 11 out of 10!",1,1,1,1,1,1,1
Vikings,"Too many weird religious symbolism that divided and diluted the intensity of this great drama series. Some members of the clan left with the shipbuilder oversea. Some took the adventure in the Mediterranean and came back empty handed. There were too many and too much hallucinations cut into almost every segment of this newest season and seems to lose its direction. How could you enter a battle with so crazy hallucinations and win it? So many doomed omens affect almost every one in the battle. The lesbian queen has a new Wessex Bishop lover, a POW, critically wounded but still can make love to her. Brothers killing each other and one another....Okay, that's enough. I quit in the middle of Episode 10 and consider Season 10 a total failure. Still watchable, but not good enough to keep my focus long enough. And it's a bad sign, not hallucination. Every Viking wants to go to Valhalla, but nobody wants to go there sooner. Paradise can always wait, better late than sooner.",0,1,0,1,0,1,0
Vikings,"""Vikings"" is a historical/adventure/drama television series, where the lead character is Ragnar Lothbrok, a viking young farmer who is ambitious and wants to explore new lands and civilizations. The character is inspired by the real Ragnar Lothbrok,a very well-known Norse hero, famous for his attempts to raid England and France. Besides him, we get to know his family and friends: his envious brother Rollo, his son Bjorn Ironside, his wife Lagertha (who is also a fantastic warrior!) his friend Floki, Aslaug, among many others characters who were also famous in the Viking Saga.Ragnar starts as a frustrated farmer, who is not satisfied with Earl Haraldson interests in only sending his vikings raiders to poor places like Russian and Baltic countries. Ragnar and his friend Floki build a faster fleet of boats to make them to the western world, where Ragnar is sure they will have richer countries to raid and a better soil to plant and live. We see the ascension of Ragnar from farmer to King, and all the different cultures who never had contact with each other before,getting into war or trying to reach a diplomacy.In my personal opinion, ""Vikings"" is very entertaining, even if it has some historical inaccuracies. I agree with Michael Hirst, the show runner, who said ""that they had to take some liberties with Vikings, specially because no one really knows for sure what happened in the Dark Ages"": If you watch ""Vikings"" as a TV series instead of a documentary and if you are into History/Viking/European movies/books/TV series you are probably going to enjoy it. It is one of my favorite TV series at the moment and I am anxious to the next season. The acting is also great and Katheryn Winnick is my muse!My vote is 9/10.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1
Vikings,"After the Fall of the Roman Empire, circa 400 CE, Europe and her surrounding territories plunged into an abysmal era, often called the Dark Ages. While some believe the term too pejorative, other scholars have acknowledged it as a strange time when societal infrastructure was very tenuous. Warring barbarians battled for land and wealth across Europe until the territory was more or less united under Charlemagne in circa 800. Of the many barbarian groups associated with the Dark Ages, including the Goths and the Huns, the Vikings still capture our imaginations. Their picturesque ships with ornamented bow and single mast sail are iconic imagery associated with voyage, plunder and even pagan mythology. Their battle-axes, thick swords, and wooden shields symbolize a world plunged into literary and cultural darkness in which warrior might was esteemed beyond all else. Unfortunately the Vikings plundered many areas of Europe, notably the Irish monasteries where beautiful books were pillaged for the jewels ornamenting their covers. The History Channel has produced a narrative series chronicling the lives of a Viking tribe during the 8th century. Ragnar Lothbrok (Travis Fimmel) is the man of a humble family of four living on the outskirts of a Viking settlement. He and his family have sworn fealty to Earl Haraldson (Gabriel Byrne), the chieftain of the tribe. In the first episode, the story begins at the end of a battle in which Lothbrok has survived a brutal confrontation. We learn not only of his family and his farm but that Lothbrok is a warrior who has ambitions to raid the west by sea.Lothbrok and his son travel to the main urban center of their tribe. There, Lothbrok's son and another boy swear fealty to Earl Haraldson by kneeling and accepting a wrist ring. Oaths of fealty, the swearing of allegiance to a lord, became a widespread ceremonial rite during the Dark Ages. The ritual is associated with feudalism in which vassals swore allegiance and servitude to a lord. Before the oath, the boys along with a congregation of males, witness a trial and punishment of two residents who are convicted of crimes. After the ceremonies, Lothbrok suggests to the earl and those present that they sail west instead of their typical eastern raid. Earl Haraldson becomes indignant and chastises Lothbrok in private.However, unbeknown-st to the Earl, Lothbrok has secretly commissioned a new ship to sail west thus disobeying his lord's instructions. Thus begins a wonderful series of Viking culture intertwined with a compelling story. The production values are as good as any feature film recently produced. The photography of the lush Scandinavian landscapes is breathtaking, the acting superb, and the script compelling. This offering is far more compelling with a richer tapestry than other similar series such as the Tudors which was nothing more than a soap opera set in the 16th century. ""Vikings"" is one of the best historical made-for-television series since ""Band of Brothers"".",1,1,1,1,0,1,1
Vikings,"This is pretty terrible! The acting is really bad as are the strange accents used by the ""pretend Vikings"". Every now and again you hear accented English, then it reverts to standard English. The script and dialog are pretty pathetic. Choppy editing also contributed to a poor production! It's impossible to understand how this series went on for more than 1 season.",-1,-1,-1,-999,-999,-1,-1
Vikings,"The fourth season of History Channel's violent Viking epic continues to tell the tale of King Ragnar Lothbrok, played by Travis Fimmel who will be in the upcoming Warcraft movie, after his assault on Paris. In the first half of the fourth season, Ragnar has left his brother Rollo, played by Clive Standen, in ancient France to make political maneuvers but it turns out his brother, who has always had a bad relationship with his more powerful brother, has sided with the French, married the emperor's daughter, and pledged to defend the city against the Vikings.Floki, played by Gustaf Skarsgård, reaps the punishment of killing Ragnar's friend the priest. Floki has always been a bit crazy but the torture he endures in this season helps to push him over the edge. Still he manages to make it through the battles throughout the episodes in his dark eye shadow with the help of the gods.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com",1,1,1,0,1,1,0

Vikings,"I was initially unsure how I would feel about this show as the theatrical trailer didn't really inspire me. It looked interesting but I certainly wasn't expecting it to be as great as it really is. Vikings is a gritty dramatic roller-coaster ride. It's well balanced in its approach and doesn't rely on just sex and gore to carry it. In fact it was so good that I couldn't help but binge watch the first couple of seasons.The characters lives have been really well established and their journeys mapped out. Even the supporting characters have substance and depth. It made me care about them instead of just being disgusted with their behaviour. It makes it much easier to understand what they were doing it for.I feel that what Game of Thrones has done with sex and fantasy, Vikings has done with storytelling and adventure. Nothing feels too far-fetched and even in a different time you can relate in some way.",1,1,1,0,1,1,1
Vikings,"They aimed for realism, I suppose. We see women doing household chores,we see authentic-looking Viking clothing. The battle scenes seem gory enough.What ruins everything is the wooden characters and the pretentious, wooden dialog. Did you ever notice that how in some historical epics, the characters speak as if to say ""I am a person from the past and we do not speak or act like you modern people."" But in the truly good historical epics, people acted lively, and people talked in natural, normal tones...and had personalities.Wooden is the word. The acting and the dialog is more wooden than Sequoia National Forest. It put me to sleep. And it would probably help if they hired actors who could act.Compare this with the Kirk Douglas movie,The Vikings..with Janet Leigh, Ernest Borgnine, and Tony Curtis. They had actors who could act and they had lively dialog. Not to mention superior direction and pacing. Huge difference.",1,-1,1,1,0,-1,0

The Grinch,"I know this will upset some folks, but the 2000 version of Dr. Seuss' classic, ""How The Grinch Stole Christmas"" was an abomination. First, the entire message of the original story was lost...and was, in fact, the opposite of Seuss' story. Second, the story was all about Jim Carrey and his mugging for the camera....everything else seemed secondary. Because of this, I was terribly disappointed, as I loved the original story and the great 1966 cartoon. Because of this, I was very reticent to watch this 2018 incarnation. But, in hindsight, my fears about the latest film are mostly unfounded.Because the film is about an hour and a half long, I already realized that the story had to be padded and include some new material...this is just inevitable. However, I was surprised how much I liked this material...such as the Grinch's cute reindeer. It was very pleasant and all contributed to the story instead of distracting from it. And, as far as the story goes, it stuck pretty close to the book--even using many exact quotes from the classic tale.As far as the quality of the film goes, it's a mixed bag but mostly good. The animation was eye-popping and wonderful. It really is great on the big screen and the 3-D effects were magnificent. I also liked that they made the Grinch a hater of Christmas but NOT a hateful or evil character. He was kinder and more sweet at times....even though he hated the holiday. The only things I wasn't thrilled about were the narration by John Legend and the voicework for the Grinch himself by Benedict Cumberbatch. I had the distinct impression that BOTH were used simply because the studio could get them--not because they were appropriate for the film. Legend is apparently a nice guy...but his nice-guy voice wasn't what you'd want or expect from a narrator. The same for Cumberbatch--who DID sound very different from his usual English accented voice but still was too 'normal' a voice for a character such as the Grinch.Overall, despite my voice talent complaint, the film is a great family film...one that honors the book and 1966 film instead of ignoring it like the 2000 incarnation. Well worth seeing and amazingly heartwarming...especially at the end as well as when the Grinch is interacting with his dog and pet reindeer.",1,0,1,0,0,0,1
The Grinch,"Part of me was interested in seeing 'The Grinch', being a fan of the original Dr Seuss story and especially the 1966 animated version with Boris Karloff voicing Grinch (do like the Jim Carrey version better than most) and being someone who likes Benedict Cumberbatch and a lot of what he's done. Was nervous though too because the trailer did not look good, the reviews are mixed to not great and did question whether it was necessary.Dr Seuss adaptations have been very hit and miss. The animated short television specials have fared significantly better than the feature films, Dr Seuss' work lends itself better to adaptations of a short length and the television specials were not only great adaptations and true in detail and spirit but great on their own. Of the feature films, the best one is by far 'Horton Hears a Who' with the worst being the live action 'The Cat in the Hat' (to me among the worst films ever made). Illumination has also been variable, loved the first two 'Despicable Me' films while not caring for 'Minions'.Saw 'The Grinch' anyway as someone trying to see and review as many 2018 films as possible and loving the story and Christmas films, also to see how Cumberbatch would fare as Grinch. Seeing it, it is nowhere near as good as the 1966 version and is neither a Christmas cracker or a bah humbug. It is also neither among the best or worst films of the year, somewhere in the middle for me.There are definitely great things here. The animation cannot be faulted, so much gorgeous and meticulous attention to detail and rich vibrant colours that really immerses one into the world of Whoville. Some of the soundtrack has a festive and infectious feel. There are funny and emotional moments, the former with the funny and adorable (plus more interesting) Max and the latter with the Cindy Lou subplot, that and the character herself being the sweet and charming heart of the film.It is not a film without soul, having a warm glow more than once and some spirited elaborate set pieces, it does well with sticking to the spirit of the story and with the back and forth between Mount Crumpet and Whoville. It is not too long and has a lively pace generally. As said, Max and Cindy Lou are the best characters. Mostly the voice acting is good, with Cameron Seely being the clear standout.Having said all of this, 'The Grinch' could have been better. It does offer very little new or fresh, trying to be faithful to the source material while not moving enough beyond that that it all feels too safe. It could have done with more humour and heart generally, could have done without the repetitive and tired screaming goat gag and outside of the Cindy Lou subplot soul is missing.Found myself mixed on the pretty unrecognisable Cumberbatch. He does well providing a curmudgeonly touch and has moments of grinchy- meanness, plaudits too for not making Grinch too scary or resorting to excessive mugging. Do feel though that he was not mean or Grinchy-enough and he would have fared much better using his own voice for the character which would have fitted better. Had a big issue with the annoying, intrusive and over-explanatory narration that was not always necessary and with a rather out of place Pharrell Williams. Other parts of the soundtrack grated and too reminiscent of commercial music neither catchy or to my taste that didn't gel with the setting or the rest of the film. Too many of the supporting characters are forgettable and one-dimensional.Overall, better than what the critics have generally said but was rather mixed on a film with a lot of great merits but feels too safe and one does question the point of it. 6/10 Bethany Cox",1,1,1,0,0,1,0
The Grinch,"The Grinch (Benedict Cumberbatch) hates Christmas. To his horror, he has emotionally eaten all the food and is forced to go into Whoville during the Christmas season. It doesn't go well and he comes up with the idea to ruin Christmas by impersonating Santa Claus. Meanwhile, Cindy Lou Who needs to talk to Santa about her wish. She recruits her friends to catch Santa.The 1966 special is perfect. This movie tries to improve on it by expanding on the story. It's a fool's errand. It could never improve on perfection. I actually don't mind the expansion in general. There are two big no-nos. The Whos look way too human and where are their antennas? They're just people with tiny noses. If the Whos are humans, then make Grinch a human and make this a live action movie. I wouldn't recommend it but at least, that could be interesting. This movie tries to be too modern. It needs to get rid of the electronics. The Whos exist in a specific world and the closer it gets to the modern world, the worst the visual content gets. The Whos have a certain style. At some point, it's no longer Dr. Seuss. At least, it's short. As for the voice work, the original had the greatness of Boris Karloff and the iconic song with Thurl Ravenscroft. These are iconic voices like Darth Vader. It doesn't get better than the best. Now it can be argued that Karloff was not the Grinch but rather the narrator reading the Grinch's dialogue. He's still the voice of the Grinch to me and Cumberbatch is doing something less compelling. I can see how the voice fits the character but it comes off weakly. Cindy Lou Who is older which is fine but the Whos sound too modern. They lack the wide eyed innocence that is inherent in their world. Nobody is evil but there is a stress in some of them especially the mom. Finally, there is the Grinch underwear. I get the joke but I'm conflicted about the results. Overall, this is an impossible job. Unless the filmmaker is willing to take unhealthy risks, it could never achieve much more than this movie. It's fine but this will be soon forgotten.",-1,0,0,0,1,0,0
The Grinch,"Okay, here we have the newest version of that one character by Dr. Seuss who is most loved by many: The Grinch. This time it is not starring Jim Carrey, but this 2018 take is entirely animated and I have read people say that this is considered a potential candidate to be nominated for Best Animated Feature Film at the Oscars, but I think the reception was not good enough overall and chances are slim for the film to make the field, even if the year 2018 in animation is not at its most competitive I'd say. The main character is voiced by Benedict Cumberbatch and you will find some other known names in the cast perhaps like Lansbury of course, but also Jones and Pharrell. I cannot say a whole lot, actually nothing at all, about these voice performances for I watched the German dub that has Otto Waalkes in it and actually I am glad I could listen to him all the time and not the in my opinion very overrated Cumberbatch. Waalkes also did a really good job, was perhaps the best thing about the film all in all. But that was not too difficult as the film also left me unimpressed for the most part sadly.First of all, I felt the little girl, who is really the defining human character here, was very uninteresting and pale, not just compared to the Grinch, but also as a standalone character. Her role is so major, but she brought so little. Very disappointing. Okay, as for the crew I will spare you the names of the many writers and directors. The one you need to know of course is Seuss and actually it's been over half a century now already since the making of the original about the one we have here. But the character is still interesting and relevant without a doubt. Even if I felt the sceneries and locations were not as memorable visually as they could have been, I liked the Grinch's looks a lot. Also really liked that they put the dog next to him and that he took good care of it which shows that he really has a heart and yeah as we find out at the end, the problem is his loneliness that turned him into such a miser. But yeah, even the ending that was kinda heartfelt did not feel as emotional to me as it could have been as in theory this ending has a lot to offer, not just for me. One thing I did enjoy though were the minor characters, like the loud goat or the fat reindeer that brings his family in the end and when we see him reunite with said family earlier, it is one of the best moments of the movie. Again that scene shows how the Grinch is a good guy deep inside as he lets him go, even if he cannot fulfill flawlessly his plan now. So he has to recruit the tiny dog to pull the gigantic sleigh. Oh well, the dog is really glad to be of help and that was kinda cute too. He really loves his owner, no matter how grumpy he may be.Okay I think that's all that comes to mind. I believe it was clear that this film would not really suck a whole lot from the beginning. But yeah, I also think it could have been much better too be honest and it was a bit of a missed opportunity as now it could be another decade or even more until the next Grinch movie. Solid quality from Illumination, better than some of their other stuff, but also worse than their best (for that the human characters were just too weak and almost entirely forgettable) I guess. One of the better, but certainly not best animated films of 2018. I give it a thumbs-up.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1
The Grinch,"I watched this with my grandson. Yes, I still think the original cartoon based on the book is superior. There is a simplicity that really works. The Grinch is downright mean. I love Benedict Cumberbach, but found his voice just too soothing to pull off our guy. There was too much psychological mumbo jumbo as the writers came up with an excuse for the Grinch being the way he was. Of course, it was his childhood. The movie is spectacular in its visuals. There are colorful scenes and excellent structures, making Whoville really magnificent. But the story is watered down and using Cindy Lou Who as an active character didn't work for me.",-1,0,-1,1,1,1,1
The Grinch,"This is a reboot for modern times. The differences:First thing I noticed is that Boris Karloff and Thurl Ravenscroft are gone. They are pitifully replaced Benedict Cumberbatch who sounds like a real geek. The hip-hop version of the song was equally bad. Cindy Lou Who is being raised by a single mom. Whoville has some token diversity in the background, but not any main characters.The songs were Jesus oriented and not secular as before, however on the flip side, the Whos were concerned their presents were gone, unlike the first feature where they broke out in song, which I found more spiritually uplifting than their Christmas songs. What kid would recognize Nilsson? And anybody who does would have seen the original and be let down by this one. Who was the target audience?And did the guy giving away reefs sound like he said reefer? Couldn't they get Tony Todd or Samual L. Jackson to read the parts?",-1,-1,0,0,-1,-1,0
The Grinch,Dr Seuss short story of The Grinch gets a second big screen treatment.There was a very good short animated cartoon made in 1966 where the Grinch was voiced by Boris Karloff.This CGI animated version is colourful but bland. The songs have been updated by they come across as mediocre. The voice acting is below par. Benedict Cumberbatch does not come anywhere near Jim Carrey never mind Karloff.Here the Grinch hates Christmas because as a child he was always lonely at Christmas. Forced to go into Whoville during the run up to Christmas to stock up on food. The Grinch sees consumerism gone rampant over the festive period. Everything is bigger including the Christmas tree and there is forced jollity.The Grinch has a twisted idea to ruin everyone's Christmas. One girl Cindy-Lou wants to speak to Santa as she has a special wish. Maybe she can make the Grinch's heart two sizes bigger.Obviously the kids will enjoy this overlong movie. It lacks the wicked fun and zest of the 1966 cartoon.,1,-1,1,1,-1,1,1
The Grinch,"So yes there was the Jim Carey one (which you may think is the original, but seems like Boris Karloff would like to disagree according to imdb at least), but if you watch them back to back and with any nostalgia excluded, you may feel like me ... and see this as the superior movie. Though I have not seen the Karloff one, so I'm not saying the ultimate Grinch.Having said, the Carey Grinch was live action and this is animated. So maybe you prefer one over the other anyway. If that is the case, I will not be able to tell you what's what anyway. But this does take things that I personally would consider ""flaws"" from the Carey adaptation and succeed in making them work (like the santa sleigh with the presents to name one). Very well animated and voice talent that deserves that name and then some. Great kids movie that grown ups can enjoy too",1,1,1,1,1,1,1
The Grinch,"First there was the 1966 Chuck Jones/Boris Karloff cartoon, second was the 2000 live-action Jim Carrey movie, this is the third adaptation of the famous story by Dr. Suess, a computer-animated outing from the makers of Despicable Me. Basically the Whos down in Whoville are preparing for Christmas, everyone is excited to be buying gifts, decorations and food. The only one who is not in the festive spirit is the cantankerous, green-haired creature called The Grinch (Benedict Cumberbatch) who lives in a cave on Mount Crumpit just north of the town. He hates Christmas, it is assumed the reason is because his heart is two sizes too small, his only friend is his loyal dog Max, they only come out of the cave if they need food or to do bad things. Six-year-old Cindy Lou Who (Cameron Seely) notices her mother Donna Who (Angie Tribeca's Rashida Jones) has been overworked looking after her and her twin brothers Buster and Bean. She decides to send a letter to Santa Claus to ask for help for her mother, but she encounters the Grinch, who sarcastically says she should talk to Santa face-to-face about it, she eventually decides to try and trap Santa with the help of her friends. With Christmas just around the corner, the festivities cause the Grinch to relive her sad childhood, he spent it mostly alone and unwanted in a rundown orphanage. The Grinch wants Christmas to end once and for all, so he comes up with the idea everything Christmassy and lessen his distress. To start his plan, he goes to find a reindeer, the only one he is able to lure is a fat reindeer he names Fred, and he steals a sleigh from frenemy Mr. Bricklebaum (Kenan Thompson). The Grinch has a test run, but discovers that Fred has a wife and child, with a heavy heart he lets him go back to them. On Christmas Eve, the Grinch makes a Santa Claus disguise and many gadgets to assist his theft, and he makes Max into a makeshift reindeer to pull the sleigh. During the night, the Grinch and Max go down to Whoville and begin stealing all decoration, presents and food, going house to house. The final house the Grinch goes to is Cindy Lou's, he encounters her when she attempts and fails to trap him, thinking he is Santa Claus. The Grinch is touched by her request to help lighten her mother's workload, and her kind advice about listening to the Whos' singing to take his sadness away, nevertheless he continues with his mission. After stealing every Christmas present and decoration, the Grinch and Max head back to the top of Mount Crumpit to dump it, but the Grinch waits to hear the sadness of the Whos. The townspeople wake on Christmas warning and are shocked to see everything festive has been taken, Cindy Lou believes she is to blame, for ""catching"" Santa, but her mother assures her Christmas is more than just presents. The Whos join together in song, the Grinch hears the singing and is puzzled to see and hear them celebrating without anything Christmassy. The Grinch realises that Christmas is more than just presents, he immerses himself in the singing, his heart grows three sizes, and he is filled with joy and wonder. The sleigh almost falls off the edge of the mountain, the Grinch tries to save it, in the nick of time Fred and his family come to the rescue. The Grinch and Max go to Whoville to return the stolen items, he admits his theft to the Whos and apologises before returning to his cave. Feeling sorry for the Grinch, Cindy Lou comes to invite him to her house to celebrate Christmas, he awkwardly attends. When seated down for dinner, he confesses that it wasn't really Christmas he hated, it was being lonely and his bitterness over being neglected, the Grinch offers a toast, and has the honour of carving the roast beast for the feast. Also starring Tristan O'Hare as Groopert, Sam Lavagnino as Ozzy, Ramone Hamilton as Axl, Angela Lansbury as Mayor McGerkle, Scarlett Estevez as Izzy, Michael Beattie as Store Clerk and Georgia Toffolo as Mrs. Toffee Apple, and narrated by Pharrell Williams. Cumberbatch putting on an American accent is a good choice as the exasperated hairy, green pest, Williams is an odd choice as narrator, and his version of the song ""You're a Mean One, Mr. Grinch"" is not very good. There is nothing wrong with the animation, and it sticks to the basic plot with the mean creature stealing Christmas, but the backstory of why the Grinch is mean isn't great, the lead character integrating with other characters is a mistake, it only makes you laugh a little, and the sentimentality is icky, it is nowhere near as entertaining as previous versions, a disappointing and very average seasonal animated comedy.

The Grinch,"Previously, Dr. Seuss' book ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" was filmed in drawn animation by Chuck Jones with Boris Karloff voicing the title character as well as narrating and in live action by Ron Howard with Jim Carrey playing that same character. Now, Benedict Cumberbatch voices him in computer animation by Illumination Entertainment, makers of the Despicable Me movies. It admirably changes some things and adds some other characters in expanding the story. Chuck Jones' version is still the definitive one and the Howard/Carrey version has some good moments but this current version does make this Grinch a little more sympathetic even before his transformation.

But it was actually enjoyable to see a new twist to it.And it definitely helped that the animation and CGI was quite spectacular, and the level of details and textures was just phenomenal, and it really helped bring the animated movie to life on the screen.Furthermore, the impressive cast list also helped bring the characters to life on the screen in a very convincing manner.""The Grinch"" is definitely an animated movie that it well-worth sitting down to watch with the family for the Christmas holidays.

The Grinch,""" . . . he just stole our stuff,"" proclaim the victims of perhaps Universal Movie Studio's scariest monster yet, THE GRINCH. Universal has long recognized that Ecclesiastical Ogres in general--such as THE MUMMY, and the Egyptian priests manipulating him--and Roman despoilers in particular, including THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME, are especially threatening because they ring so true to Real Life. As Hollywood's pre-eminent House of Horror, Universal pulls out all the stops for THE GRINCH, giving him the same sort of cavernous hide-out, massive pipe organ, and self-pitying misanthropy displayed nearly a century ago by its PHANTOM OF THE OPERA. However, a screaming Lamb gets in the last syllable of THE GRINCH. This is appropriate, since the Lamb of God would no doubt react more violently to most any opulent modern-day Temple than He did to His birth ""den of vipers"" in Jerusalem.

It's bright and colourful, nicely animated, well-voiced. visually imaginative (albeit on-model with the Seuss master vision), has a lot of quite funny gags, and a decent moral.

And then there's Kenan Thompson, stealing the whole movie.It's not bad, just unnecessary.",1,1,0,-999,-999,1,1
The Grinch,"I only watched this movie because my wife wanted a Christmas movie on Christmas. You could describe me as a grinch as I can't be bothered with those kind of holidays. But anyway I watched it, got bored after about five minutes, promised myself to sit through it and that's exactly what I did, sat through it. Okay the animation is well done, like almost any other animated movie I guess, but the story itself is just not my thing. The rhyming of Dr. Seuss might work for kids, but I'm not a kid and so I don't care. Benedict Cumberbatch, never been a big fan of him as an actor, and after The Grinch I will never be a fan of him narrating either. I thought I would be the only one who didn't like this movie but after reading the first page of reviews I guess we're plenty like me.",-1,0,-1,-999,1,-1,1
The Grinch,"This is the classic Dr. Seuss story put to theaters in animation. I'm going to say that it's better than the Jim Carrey version. Well, not by that much really. I admired the animation at least. This is probably the second best Dr. Seuss movie next to ""Horton Hears A Who!"". I think the running time was good.It worked have worked better as a short film. Well, it already DOES work better as a short film. Maybe it's because I've seen so many movies that I can't really find anything good or bad about it. It's completely harmless in every sense of the word. It really just doesn't add anything new or interesting to the story. It's just so-so. **1/2",1,1,1,1,1,1,1
The Grinch,"The GrinchThe easiest way to ruin Christmas is to redirect all Amazon shipments to the Third World.Thankfully, the party-pooper in this animated movie lives a cave with no WiFi.A green hermit named The Grinch (Benedict Cumberbatch) watches over Whoville from his mountaintop with much disdain, particularly for its obsession with the yuletide. To quell the joyous season this year, The Grinch hatches a plan to impersonate Santa so he can pilfer all presents and decorations from the neighbouring township. Meanwhile, a Whoville child hopes to capture Claus so she can make a wish for her overworked mother (Rashida Jones).Outside of the sappy single mom storyline, Cumberbatch's nasally performance and some slick animation, this adaptation of Dr. Seuss' children's book pretty much follows the same narrative of the far superior 2-D animated TV special.Moreover, if The Grinch hates Christmas so much he should just convert to Islam.

The Grinch,"This third screen adaptation of Dr. Seuss's 1957 children book 'How the Grinch Stole Christmas!' was not good. Don't get me wrong, the 2018's computer-animation movie produced by Illumination Entertainment & released by Universal Pictures was not a holiday stinker. However, it was indeed, a huge disappointment. It doesn't have the unique, risky, yet funny entertaining humor of the 2000 live-action film version nor the charm of the original 1966 hand drawn animation television special. It was just adequate and that's really sad. Most of the blame, can be said with how they portray the reclusive, Mr. Grinch (Voiced by Benedict Cumberbatch) who decides to ruin Christmas for the cheery citizens of Whoville by stealing all their gifts and everything holiday related. He really not that mean. He should had been a heel that should had been cuddly as a cactus. A being that charming as an eel. Yet, throughout the movie, he really is not that bad to be around. Even before, Christmas even came, he already had a heavy heart to certain key characters. He doesn't exploit or mistreat them, much at all. That's a problem, because the Grinch is supposed a bad banana, with a greasy black peel who heart is 'two sizes too small', but he's not! Even his reasons for hating the holiday is kinda muddled. I get that, Christmas, kinda remind him, about how alone and unwanted, he thinks, he really is, but the Who People don't really treat him, that way to justified that type of thinking. Throughout the film, people like Bricklebaum (Voiced by Kenan Thompson), who by far, is the best character in the flick, really go out of their way to befriend him. There's nothing to suggest the Grinch is ostracized by the Who People. Now, if the film make the citizen of Whoville look like selfish materialism consumer bullies like the 2000 film version did. It gives a good reason why the Grinch would think of stealing gifts is fine idea to stop Christmas. Even the original 1966 film, gave an understandable motive for him, trying to steal their gifts, as he couldn't stand, all the noise. He found their loud hedonism nature to be annoying. People can related to that. In this film, only the out of blue carolers are highly obnoxious with their over-stalking forcing of religionist beliefs type singing. Everybody else is just normal and fine. While, this movie hints that he might suffer from some type of social anxiety. It never states, outright if he does has it. Because of this lack of depth, the character motive might seem confusing, and very lost. Another problem with the Grinch is the voice. Benedict's American accent voice has no weight. It's sound a little bland. It didn't seem powerful or sinister at all. The tone had no kick. What happened, here!? Was the Smaug or Khan's voice, too dark to use in a kid's movie!? I doubt it. After all, they got Frankenstein Monster, himself, Boris Karloff to voice the titular character & the narrator in the original version. Look, I get that the film will never outdo the original film, but gees, the 2018's remake directed by Scott Mosier played it, way too safe with the Grinch. Even the narrator felt out of place. Pharrell Williams was not a good choice. Not only did he never did any kind of voice acting, before this. He didn't really, have that seniority traditional storytelling depth & tone, need for this piece in the first place. It felt like he was nervously, reading off, a script, as quick as possible rather than helping, expanding the depth of this world like Sir Anthony Hopkins did in the 2000 film. Also, it was somewhat irritating that the writers didn't keep focus on the original story poem-like rhythm for most of the sequence, he was speaking. Things get more frustrating when the movie try to update the original song 'You're a Mean One, Mr. Grinch' by music performer, Thurl Ravenscroft with one from hip hop artist, Tyler the Creator, whom been criticized in the past for his use of homophobic slurs, racial stereotypes, his graphic depictions of violence against women and his allegedly misogynistic lyrics. While, his version was indeed catchy, it still feels dirty to listen to. I can see people, easily getting turn off by it, due to the negatively surrounding his personal life. It will only have niches amount of listeners. It will quickly seem passes. It will never hold the same candle to the Ravenscroft's version; which spiritual transcendence all time. As for the upbeat jazzy version of this song by Bob Malone. I see this one, having more of a shelf life. It's a lot more fun to listen to. As for the humor, in the film. The jokes were not that funny. Nothing really did landed for me. The movie also has pacing problem. Lots of pointless filler scenes that run the time, a little too long like the reindeer hunting sequence & the b plot of Cindy Lou (Voiced by Cameron Seely) trying to capture Santa Claus. None of them, were that compelling nor matter much. At least, the animation was good. It maintaining a colorful and festive atmosphere. Overall: I just wish, the story stood out more. It felt formula, generic & worst of all, recycled. There were too many similar to 2010's film 'Despicable Me' for me to like. If one of your characters sounds & acts like too much like Agnes from 2010's film 'Despicable Me', then you got a problem. In the end, while, I wouldn't say, don't touch this with a 39 ½ foot pole. Given the choice between watching this, again and watching a movie about a seasick crocodile. I'd take the seasick crocodile! At least, I know that film will have some bite to it. Sadly, for me, this will be one time watch.",0,1,1,-1,-1,1,-1
The Grinch,"Pretty much the definition of 'average', 'The Grinch (2018)' really is just fine in every way. It's fairly impressive in terms of its visuals and voice-work but is certainly nothing new, or even compelling, when it comes to its narrative. Really, the visuals and voice-work are only really to the expected standard of today's bigger-budgeted animated fare and the strange 'Illumination-esque' designs, combined with the pulled-back (certainly from the, frankly, creepy Carrey incarnation) but still oddball Seuss stylings, prevent the piece from appearing as aesthetically-pleasing as anything that Disney - or, more specifically, Pixar - are putting out today. The point is that the fact that it looks pretty pretty isn't enough of a selling point to recommend the piece and that's probably the biggest selling point it has. I suppose someone who isn't familiar with the source-story and is young (or willing) enough not to notice the basic nature of the narrative may get more mileage from this bland but inoffensive, family-friendly Christmas flick. 5/10",1,1,1,1,1,1,1
The Grinch,"Review:
For an animation movie made for kids, I actually enjoyed this film. Maybe I'm going soft! The animation was top class, and the vibrate colours and attention to detail was quite impressive. The director stuck to the original concept, which was a plus, and I must admit, I did get a bit emotional towards the end. Don't get me wrong, it's not in the same league as the old Pixar movies, but there is something for the whole family, especially the little ones. The movie kicks off in the town of Whoville, were the humanoids called Who's are filled with excitement about celebrating Christmas. The only one who isn't amused is a cantankerous, green-furred creature called The Grinch (Benedict Cumberbatch), who has a heart ""two sizes too small"" and lives in a cave on the top of Mount Crumpit just north of Whoville. The Grinch has a pet dog named Max and they both only visit Whoville when the Grinch needs to buy food and do bad things. Meanwhile, 5-year-old Cindy Lou Who notices that her mother Donna is overworked trying to take care of herself and her baby twin brothers, Buster and Bean. At First, she decides to send a letter to Santa Claus to help her mother, but after encountering the Grinch, who sarcastically says that she'll have to talk to Santa face-to-face about it, she then decides to go to the North Pole to talk to Santa, but when Donna tells her that it would take a month to get there and back home, her final decision is to try and trap Santa with the help of her friends. With Christmas approaching, all the Whoville festivities give the Grinch a flashback, recalling his disjointing childhood spent mostly alone and unwanted in an orphanage. The Grinch soon decides that he will steal Christmas from Whoville to assuage his distress. He acquires a fat reindeer whom he calls Fred to help him pull a sleigh that he stole from his neighbour, Mr. Bricklebaum. After a test run, the Grinch discovers that Fred has a family. With a heavy heart, he lets Fred go home with them. On Christmas Eve, after making a Santa Claus disguise and dozens of gadgets to help him with his plan, the Grinch and Max, who pulls the sleigh in Fred's place, go down to Whoville to steal the decorations and presents. He soon encounters Cindy after falling into her trap. Her request to help lighten her mother's workload, and her kind advice about listening to the Who's singing to alleviate his sadness, touches the Grinch's bitter heart, but he still carried on with his mission. After stealing every Christmas present, the Who's wake up and are shocked to see that the presents and decorations are gone. At first, Cindy believes that she's to blame because she trapped Santa, but Donna tells her that Christmas is more than just about presents and that Cindy's the best thing that ever happened to her. The Who's then join together and sing, which puzzles the Grinch because they are still celebrating Christmas, despite the theft. After heeding Cindy's advice and immersing himself to their singing, his small bitter heart grows up three times it's original size. The Grinch and Max decide to return to Whoville to return the stolen items. A guilt-ridden and remorseful Grinch admits his crimes to the Who's, and apologises before returning to his cave. Feeling sorry for the Grinch, Cindy Lou comes to invite him to celebrate Christmas at her house, and he awkwardly attends. When seated down for dinner, he realises and confesses that it wasn't really Christmas he despised, but being alone and his bitterness over being neglected. Before carving the roast beast, the Grinch affects a toast ""To kindness and love, the things we need most. What a sweet story! Personally, I can't see myself watching it more than once, but I still enjoyed this adaptation of an old classic. Although he was a grumpy so and so, I liked the relationship between the Grinch and his trustee companion Max, who was always there for him. I did think that the soundtrack didn't suit the film, and the narrating got on my nerves after a while but judging by the box office takings, and the decent reviews, it's still worth a watch. Watchable!Round-Up:
This is the first major release for director Scott Mosier, who did a decent job with this project, even though it has been made a few times before. It was also directed by Yarrow Cheney, who was co-director for the Secret Life of Pets, The Very First Noel and the Minions short, Puppy!. After watching the bonus material, It's amazing to see the amount of work that goes on behind the scenes in the animation world, which is why it takes so long to release movies in this genre. Every hair, colour and facial expression is finely detailed, which goes through many processes before it's final render, so I appreciate the work that went into making this film. With that aside, I do think that the humour could have been much better, and I would have liked to have seen some more depth from the various characters but it's still fun for the whole family.Budget: $75million

The Grinch,"If you have watched the grinch before, this movie offers few surprises. There were some additions, like the single mother and the reindeer, that were cute, but they didn't offer any entertainment. The choice to add more of Max, The grinch's dog, was a good one, as it gave the grinch a more ""human"" aspect, showing that there was some potential there for improvement and that he wasn't that bad after all. Actually, the grinch here was more of a loner rather than the bad guy. So, overall, it was just another grinch movie.",1,1,1,1,-999,1,-999
The Grinch,"Almost nothing from the trailer is in this film, and it's better that way. Illumination Entertainment has a reputation for purely profit-oriented lowest common denominator fluff with no substance. The trailer gave me that impression but the film thankfully overcame that. It's engaging with a good message but the plot is a bit thin. Most of the characters and plot events are purely in service of some gags.",1,0,0,-999,-999,0,1
The Grinch,"The well-known story gets a fresh, new look with this 2018 version. I so badly wanted to like it, but unfortunately it was not to be.The animation is fantastic and the 'camera angles' are really good for an animated film. None of the characters really stood out as special, though, except for the dog Max, who was by far my favorite character. I didn't find the Grinch's story believable or interesting. The film itself is over-sentimental at times, while other scenes are simply too childish, looking like a cartoon instead of an animated feature.'The Grinch' (2018) is definitely more for children, as I doubt it will have the desired effect on adults. This was not as special as films like 'Arthur Christmas', 'The Polar Express' and the more recent 'Klaus'.If you've purchased the DVD, its worth watching the 3 Mini Movies included. They are much funnier than the feature film.https://paulsmoviereviews.wordpress.com/2019/12/03/the-grinch-2018/",-1,-1,0,-1,1,-1,1
The Grinch,"The Grinch (3 out of 5 stars).The Grinch is an okay animated Christmas movie and being like third adaptation of How the Grinch Stole Christmas. From the classic animated feature which was beloved to Jim Carrey's The Grinch which was fun and creative. However, this Grinch film does not do anything new to make this worth while. You got the same plot, same characters, new colorful animation, and decent humor. Adults may be bored or tired of seeing this being adapted again. But kids will surely enjoy this film.The animation was colorful and entertaining which made it fun to look at. Seeing Grinch angry annoyed look was fun. Seeing how he walks around whoville avoiding Christmas carolers, kids building snowmans, and being rude to customers at the store. How he treats his dog Max like his butler. Sure, he slowly find his heart to give back Christmas after he steals everyone's Christmas decorations and gifts. The characters were still fun. There is Cindy Lou Lou, whose mother is busy working all the time and trying to be there for her and her twin brothers. And she wants to trap Santa when he delivers gifts to ask for another wish.The story is the same. I feel like the movie was lacking creativity in seeing something different with this movie. Benedict Cumberbatch voices the Grinch and it was decent. It felt a little flat with the character. Really makes you miss Jim Carrey's version since he was closer to the original material.Overall, The Grinch is a fair family film. Plot, characters, and concept are the same. Been seen and done too many times. It lacked a bit of humor which adults will find a little boring. Except for the kids will love this movie.",1,1,0,1,1,1,1
Supernatural,"Supernatural has certainly found its audience. I compare it to a ballplayer like Robin Yount who came to work every day for the Milwaukee Brewers, did his job without flash and when it all ended he had 3000 hits and a place in Cooperstown. It rivals the Law And Order franchise, Bonanza, Gunsmoke, and even the original Dr. Who for longevity.Other than they did it without flash. Because with the Winchester Family killing other worldly creatures every week and saving humanity from them, flash is certainly part of the program's makeup.The kids get all of this from their father who did this for a living and a conceived mission. When he's killed, Jared Padlecki who gave up the life rejoins brother Jensen Ackles and they've monster hunted every week for 11 years. Not unlike the Halliwell Sisters on Charmed only it gets real physical with the guys.I've read in both their biographies that Padlecki and Ackles, both native Texans are best friends in real life.

Supernatural,"I just bought the whole First Season of SUPERNATURAL after reading the reviews it got at Amazon.com and can honestly say I'm not the least bit disappointed with The Pilot that I just watched.I love a good horror series and this is obviously extremely well written, acted, produced and directed with JARED PADALECKI and JENSEN ACKLES as brothers searching for the answers to their father's disappearance and coping with ""the supernatural"" elements that confront them as they begin their journey.If the rest of the series is as good as the first season indicates so far, I'll be watching the rest of the shows.

Supernatural,"I've watched this from season one, not on CW, but when it went into syndication, and I have watched the series in order. The basis for the show - two brothers, based on the bond of family trauma due to the supernatural, travel about the land looking for the supernatural and usually finding it. The stories are compelling and interesting and often suspenseful. The acting is well done as is the direction. Why am I so ""meh"" about it? I guess it is because, after watching this show through several seasons, I just don't care about the characters. In every episode you could substitute two completely different people going through the same circumstances with different actors playing them and I would have the same connection. In modern TV shows about the supernatural, usually the stories are matephors for the human condition, so it is most important to have characters you know. Characters whose futures you care about. I was a big fan of Buffy The Vampire Slayer and Angel, and I grew to care about those characters in the Whedonverse. I just don't feel the same connection here.If the show is on I will usually sit down and watch it. But if I realize I missed an episode I'm pretty indifferent about it. A show missing such a magic ingredient can only get a 6/10 from me. Apparently from all of the other rave reviews I am alone in the universe in my opinion.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1

The characters and the stories have believability to them, which creates a levity for the show. No social messages or hidden meanings, just normal people and towns with strange happenings. My wife noticed one of the guys is from Days of are lives. I can see the actor going to the big screen one day. 10 out of 10. Get your VCRs warmed up and tape the show if you work nights like I do.

Instead of getting a total sensory feel for the land, e.g. I never did see a change (especially a rapid one) in weather which is not MT, nor much time on the Missouri & other rivers, or lakes.

Yes, there are self-interest groups in state (past & present) such as mining, logging, tourist, Native, corporate with the usual small talk of caps, rights & bureaucracies as in most states (reminded me of the series ""Dallas""), but those subplots seemed more of a veneer for a N.Y. ambience overlaid onto a map of MT (maybe because so many Easterners have summer places in MT).

The division between Wall Street, Native Americans, and a rich land baron who happens to be a rancher is all being played here. The only commonality among the disparate parties is greed. If Costner is trying to be the righteous defender then he's doing it primarily for his own designs as he's painted in the initial episode. That gives him that special JR Ewing sauce. So is it a soap or a statement against squandering natural resources? I see a well-financed new stab at a family soap here. The cinematography is rich using what appears to be Wyoming as a decent stand in for Montana. Certainly there age some good things. I hope the show becomes more real + actually giving insight in how the ruining of what is left of pristine wilderness is playing out That's not as likely as a whole raft of dark back-stabbing will likely be the plan.

Honorable family struggles against all odds to overcome its enemies and themselves.The opening episode takes a ponderous, almost languid approach to introduce us to the characters and this is a plus. The epic production doesn't need to be rushed. The devotion to location also makes this comfortable to watch.Unfortunately, as rewarding as this production is to look at, it falls flat when you listen to it. Big corporations, corrupt government, noble Indians and honorable families... all made up of cookie-cutter characters trotting out an asinine and predictable screenplay.It's a soap opera set outdoors. If you liked Dallas and Dynasty then you're going to thoroughly enjoy this romp through the same tired cliches that were done half a century ago. If you are looking for serious, captivating drama then you're going to be disappointed.So, if you accept it for what it is (a shallow, comic book collection of melodramatic silliness set in the great outdoors) it's great. If you were hoping for more than that, then it'll be a bit annoying.",0,0,0,1,0,1,1

Yellowstone,"I can't say any longer that, imo, this is the most underrated series out there.
It simply is and that's a fact! This series is second to none and that's a promise!This show is an experience. An emotional one filled with constant conflict filled with REAL cowboys. There's something so romanticizing about western shows captured and executed perfectly. When's the last time a series in this genre even mentioned the word ""Wranglers"". Its very authentic. Too real. And the dialogue is incredible. There are countless quotes from this show. That's where this show sets a precedent. THE WRITING! It is stellar and flawless.Every episode improves upon the former. It builds and builds. There are so many characters that you will become invested in and 3D characters. Every actor involved in this show has a very intriguing story or background. You'll be convinced after you realize how fast you binge the two seasons and beginning of the third (s3 episode one available at the time of this review)This also presents factual history of native Americans and casts the possibility of people learning what really happened and how important it is in order to appreciate every Native American. But this show DOES NOT force any agenda down your throat. western series always go hand in hand with Indians. Its always been cowboys and Indians but this show has presented the cowboy life, ranchers lives, and native Americans like never before. This was just a bonus to actually be enlightened and at the same time alway being captivating and compelling evoking A LOT of emotions.This show gives you the feels. I have to say RIP is an amazing character and played so superbly. As well as Costner, the actor who plays Kayce, and arguably the best performance by the daughter, Beth.It's sad that so many people are unaware of this show or havent discovered it due to the platform it's on (paramount network). If this show was on a more accessible and more prominent platform, everyone would be talking about it. It took me two episodes to be hooked. This show has A LOT of drama, constant drama and conflict, which always pushes the plot forward (conflict).Take away the humor and attire that everyone wears in HBOs phenomenal series Succession, and move them to Montana and you get the gist of what you're about to experience. This show is relentless and doesnt hold back punches. And the emotional ones keep coming too.I think it's fair to say that s1 is a solid 8.5 and the second season is 9.Do whatever you have to in terms of finding a way to watch this show because you will miss out on the best show out there!",1,0,1,1,0,0,1
Yellowstone,"Make no mistake, this series contains a lot of action, violence, and drama. However, if you're going because of this, you'll likely bail out of this early. And reading through some of these ""reviews"" I guarantee those rating this less than a seven, have threw in the towel the first few episodes and that's a tragedy and injustice to yourself.
What this series really thrives on is its stellar writing, incredible dialgue, and incredible characters deeply written oh and brilliant casting.This decade consists of truly amazing series and yet I am fully confident this is among the best. You cant view this with a sprint mindset but a marathon knowing each season improves upon the last. And believe me that's saying A LOT! Once you become hooked, you fall in love with many of these intriging characters and follow each of their journeys beautifully portrayed. This show is profound. Simple as that.

Yellowstone,"""YELLOWSTONE"" (Season 2) 9/10 🌠🌠🌠🌠🌠🌠🌠🌠🌠
Yellowstone's character John Dutton I believe is the most perfectly matched role Kevin Costner has ever played. I almost feel like if he could have chose a life as a second alternative to being a movie star he would of chosen to be John Dutton. Even with all the pain that he's endured through life. Yellowstone for me conjures that excitement of peering into a world I'm not apart of like watching the classic night time soaps like ""Dallas"" & ""Dynasty"" the only difference is ""Yellowstone"" is the night time soap for tough guys that women will enjoy just as much. The characters are phenomenal with so many different angles at play. The power shifting between the native reservation, the ranch, the law and the political pundits creates a vast storyline that's very entertaining to watch play out. Of course with a big production like this it's not surprising the acting, music, videography and beautiful landscapes leaves you in awe everytime you watch but nothing's ever guaranteed just because a big pile of money is behind something doesn't mean it will succeed but viewers have shown praise and appreciation for a show that provides a pretty big bang for every single buck. ""YELLOWSTONE"" Hands down is one of my favorite shows.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1
Yellowstone,"After watching the pilot I can't say I am impressed at all. Rather disappointed so far. Acting not the best by all, story somewhat cliché.

I'll watch future episodes, but if you like these type of shows I would advise watching Longmire.",0,-1,0,0,-999,-1,0

And as for that hairstyle - I just wanted to chop off her fringe it looked so ridiculous.Kelley Chow or Kelley Asbille as she is known as part of the stable of actors in the Hallmark Channel, hasn't improved her acting skills - still wooden with one expression.The rest of the cast are ok, although it would be nice to have actors who could articulate better rather than mumble into their chins.

Four Christmases,"Four Christmases does have its good moments, but there are many things wrong with it. It is a rather unmemorable seasonal comedy, but it is compensated by the stellar lead performances of Vince Vaughan and Reece Witherspoon. Vaughan and Witherspoon have surprisingly good chemistry, and they are ably supported by Sissy Spacek, Jon Voight, Robert Duvall and Jon Favreau. The script does have some very witty and funny moments, and there are some great scenes, such as the nativity scene and the charades scene. Another hilarious moment was when Brad unintentionally destroys his dad's living room, his dad's reactions were priceless. The scenery here was lovely and the photography was above average. Plus I have to say the soundtrack was absolutely awesome, and while admittedly formulaic the story did maintain my attention.However, what I didn't like about Four Christmases was that I didn't feel as though there was enough of the Christmas spirit to fully make it the heartwarming seasonal comedy it had the potential of being. Also while Vaughan and Witherspoon have the lion share of the best lines and scenes, while the supporting cast did well they aren't given as much to do. The last twenty minutes or so I found rather lacklustre. Maybe because it felt too over sentimental and just wasn't funny. In fact, the last couple of seconds was the funniest part of that particular section. My main gripe was Seth Gordon's unfocused direction. There is a lot of emphasis on slapstick in alternative to comic interaction, making the film rather uneven.All in all, it is a merely okay seasonal comedy. It could have been better in terms of direction and focus, but it was a decent attempt. And the stellar performances, the soundtrack and some good laughs save it becoming a complete turkey. 6/10 Bethany Cox",0,1,0,1,1,1,0
Four Christmases,"Four Christmases (2008) ** 1/2 (out of 4) It's hard to believe that a comedy like this would feature five Academy Award winners but that's the case and the end results aren't as bad as some critics made them appear. Reese Witherspoon and Vince Vaughn play the perfect couple who enjoy their lives together, which doesn't include their family. After a lie they've been telling is blown, they're forced to visit all four of their divorced parents in one day. This comedy is certainly as light weight as they come but the terrific cast makes it worth watching even though you'll still be scratching your head wondering how so many Oscar-winners ended up in one film. You have Robert Duvall, Sissy Spacek, Jon Voight and Mary Steenburgen playing all the parents but you also have famous faces like Jon Favreau, Tim McGraw and Dwight Yoakam filling out supporting roles. With all these famous faces you can't help but stay mildly entertained throughout the rather short 89-minute running time. The jokes are all rather childish but this is a family comedy after all. We get several jokes with Witherspoon not liking children yet having to hold them only to get screamed at or puked on. We have other small jokes like Vaughn's brothers being wannabe wrestlers. We get jokes dealing with showing pictures that all parents show to embarrass their kids. Some of the humor is a darker, sexual related but it all gets minor laughs. There's certainly nothing here that's going to make you fall on the ground laughing but if you enjoy cheap humor then you'll certainly want to check it out. The cast has Vaughn leading the way giving his best Vaughn performance that only Vaughn could give. Witherspoon once again proves to be better than the material at hand, which is something happening quite a bit. Spacek and Voight doesn't get too much screen time but Duvall ends up with a pretty good role as the redneck dad. Again, this isn't the greatest comedy in the world and I'm sure it'll soon be forgotten but if you have a Redbox near you then it's certainly worth a dollar.",0,1,0,0,1,1,0

Four Christmases,"I can only think of a couple good Christmas films that have been released in the 2000's, The Grinch and Elf, all the others have been average or terrible, this one was rated very low and I was hoping would not fit the rating the critics give it, so I chanced it. Basically Kate (Reese Witherspoon) and Bradford 'Brad' McVie (Vince Vaughn) have been in love and together for three years, and not being married or having children have their own fun, such as role play experiences, and they plan to spend Christmas coming on vacation, telling their parents they are going to Fiji. But when their flight is cancelled by bad weather and they unintentionally appear on the news, they are forced into having to spend time with their parents, both their mothers and fathers have divorced, meaning that they live separately, and they will have go to four Christmases. Agreeing the safe word ""mistletoe"" if they want to leave, they start by seeing Brad's father Howard (Robert Duvall) on his farm, with brother Dallas (Tim McGraw) and his two children, and brother Denver (Jon Favreau) and his wife and baby, and they reveal that Brad's real name was originally Orlando and they cause high tension and stress when trying to install a new satellite dish. Next they go to see Kate's mother Marilyn (Mary Steenburgen) along with her sister, her two aunts and her grandmother, and they reveal that Kate used to be fat and they run into some problems on stage when replacing the original stars of the local nativity for the overly religious Christian church. Visiting Brad's mother Paula (Sissy Spacek) who is a hippie, more and more things are revealed that Brad didn't originally know about while being with Kate, this is of course leads to a big argument between them because they have known each other three years and not told the truth about everything in their past. With the couple parted while things cool down and they are ready to talk again Kate goes to the last of the four Christmases alone to see her father Creighton (Jon Voight), who seems like just a regular man, but obviously feels bad for his daughter and urges that she tries to make things right between them. In the end of course Kate and Brad reconcile and promise to tell each other everything in the future, they go on their holiday to Fiji, and year later on New Year's Day they have a baby girl, and they didn't tell their parents this, but again they are unintentionally on the news as the baby is the first new-born in the city. Also starring RV: Runaway Vacation's Kristin Chenoweth as Courtney and Dwight Yoakam as Pastor Phil. Witherspoon is beautiful and lovely, Vaughn is okay, and the supporting actors I guess are fine, I will admit I did like the opening with the odd role play getting into different characters for sex later, but this is the only bit that made me smile and laugh a little, the rest of it is utter rubbish, the four Christmases are too cringe worthy that they are not funny, the characters they visit are either irritating or unbearable, and the situations that they get into are predictable and mostly unoriginal, it is a ridiculous and awful seasonal comedy.

Four Christmases,"A young couple who is leading a perfect life is forced to spend Christmas with families of their divorced parents.This is a Christmas movie that had a lot of potential. First of all, it had 5 Oscar winners and the rest of the cast are great actors as well. So the performance was on a pretty high level.In addition it had a pretty funny storyline and great jokes. No, I am not trying to say that it was a movie for deep thinking. And one knew exactly how it will end. But it was hilarious nonetheless.Unfortunately, the movie got ruined by trying to include a moral lesson. And this is the lesson that I saw many times in the movies and am already tired of. It tells us how no couple can be really happy together if they don't get married and have babies. And it is done so poorly. Why should I believe that a couple in love that spend all the time together didn't know each other's habits and didn't communicate as well as the redneck brother of Brad and his super pregnant wife? Why would I believe that Kate who had a perfect life, fully aware of what nonsense marriage is changed her mind after spending time with their dysfunctional families and their annoying bratty kids? Sure, it is a perfect message for Christmas where all movies are supposed to be cheesy, but it didn't fit into this movie at all. They started it is an over the top comedy and that was the way to finish it. I almost feel like it wasn't part of the original script and for some unknown reason they decided to add it It took me some time to decide if I should give it a 6 or a 7. The problem I described in the last paragraph pretty much ruined it. But it is hard to give anything less than 7 for a movie that has some brilliant and funny scenes.

There is not a lot of festive atmosphere. The film focuses on a series of unfortunate events that occur around Christmas time. I think there is not enough chemistry between Vince Vaughn and Reese Witherspoon. They do not really match each other. Hence, making a romantic comedy disguised as a Christmas comedy with this combination does not really work.The plot is far too contrived to be enjoyable. I know it is supposed to be a brain off film, but the first two house visits are too silly.Most of the jokes are not that funny, at most they make you giggle but not laugh. Funny moments are far in between, silliness is over the top and everywhere in the film.

Four Christmases,"Vince Vaughn and Reese Witherspoon star as a career couple who never want to spend Christmas with their families. A trip to Fiji goes awry due to weather problems and they are interviewed on live television which blows their cover. So the two agree to visit their various families on Christmas day which leads to all kinds of unforeseen disasters. Robert Duvall is Vaughn's tough dad, Jon Favreau and Tim McGraw his trained fighter brothers who love to bully him, and Sissy Spacek as his mom ""robbing the cradle"" married to his childhood friend. Reese has a foxy mother(Mary Steenburgen)dating a preacher(Dwight Yoakam who has one of those giant congregations), a sister-in-law(Kristen Chenoweth)who tells Vaughn all sorts of uncomfortable details about his girlfriend's past, and a father(Jon Voight)who has never been fooled by her excuses on why she hadn't visited him over the last few years. This mega-cast appear in light-hearted bits, each incorporating their minor parts with enough quirks and personality to leave a decent impression. Vaughn's mishaps putting up a satellite dish for his disapproving father(and the damage resulting to his house) and performance as Joseph(to Reese's Mary)are highlights, as is Reese's incident inside a ""Jump-Jump"" trying to commandeer a pregnancy test while the kids gang up on her(playing keep-away). There's nothing particularly memorable which beckons repeat viewings at Christmas time, because even the supporting cast have such limited time to truly work their magic--while their star power is quite an asset, and certain individual scenes give the characters some moments, the film really never quite utilizes them to the fullest. The ""conflict"" regarding Vaughn and Reese feels rather forced(as if the filmmakers needed to include complications to have them return to each other having ""learned a valuable lesson""), but I think they have some good scenes together.

It's not a great movie at all but it had a few good laughs and--at 88 minutes--it doesn't wear out its welcome. Supposedly Vaughn and Witherspoon didn't get along at all while working on this but you'd never know it from the film. They have some great chemistry and their comedic timing is right on target. The rest of the cast is as good as anyone could be and they all act well enough to make the entirely predictable story go down smoothly. It's not perfect. I could have lived without the TWO instances of projectile vomiting and Jon Favreau and Tim McGraw were too vicious and unfunny as Vaughn's brothers.

Four Christmases,"Vince Vaughn and Reese Witherspoon generate chemistry galore as a couple of cute yuppies who're afraid to get hitched in first-time director Seth Gordon's hilarious new holiday hootenanny ""Four Christmases,"" a raucous, PG-13 rated, romantic comedy of errors complete with Three Stooges style slapstick routines. Although our protagonists think they have it made as live-in lovers, they learn eventually that the road to happiness is paved with marital vows and infants. The source of the wit in ""Four Christmases"" grows out of what this pair doesn't know about each other. They're compelled to cancel an exotic trip to Fiji and endure four episodes with their dysfunctional families. Quadruple the hilarity of the Ben Stiller & Terry Polo comedy ""Meet the Parents,"" and you'll have some clue about how much you'll cackle. The cast bristles with Oscar-winning celebrity thespians such as Robert Duvall, Sissy Spacek, and Jon Voight. Mind you, ""Four Christmases"" isn't aimed at children, but grown-up audiences will guffaw at the misguided misanthropy of the irresponsible protagonists.Although they've been dating each other for three years, neither Brad (Vince Vaughn of ""Fred Claus"") nor Kate (Oscar winner Reese Witherspoon of ""Walk the Line"") have any intention of approaching the altar. Marriage would merely complicate matters for this free-spirited twosome. Anyway, marriage didn't work out for their parents who wound up divorcing. Brad and Kate shy away from that kind of commitment. Every Christmas for the last three years, they send their regrets to their parents that they won't be able to visit because they're performing charitable acts for destitute people in third world countries. Brad goes so far as to research his lies so they contain a ring of veracity. Our couple arrives at the airport to pick up their tickets when they discover to their chagrin that a pea-soup fog has grounded all flights. Matters worsen when a TV news crew captures them 'live' on camera commenting about their Fiji holiday disaster. No sooner have Brad and Kate been exposed as hypocrites than their respective family members contact them and invite them out for a bit of Christmas cheer. Reluctantly, Brad and Kate set out to make the best of a bad predicament with no idea that their lives are about to change beyond anything that they had imagined.The screenplay by Matt R. Allen, Caleb Wilson, Jon Lucas, and Scott Moore turns out to be funnier than you'd expect considering that ""Four Christmases"" is formulaic frivolity from start to finish. Virtually everything that can go wrong for our heroes does, but everything works out for the best by fade-out. The comedy is predictable but nevertheless entertaining. Gordon and his writers depict our couple in the worst case scenarios.Brad and Kate visit Brad's divorced dad who keeps a stuffed skunk on the wall as well as rabbit hunting trophies. Brad has to contend with his two muscle-bound, Neanderthal-minded brothers Denver (""Iron Man"" director Jon Favreau) and Dallas (Tim McGraw), who're semi-professional cage wrestlers. They constantly embarrass poor Brad by pinning him to the floor in humiliating head and body locks and then bringing in their obnoxious brats to slap him silly. Kate learns that Brad's real name is Orlando. Brad's redneck pappy Howard (Robert Duvall of ""Open Range""), who drives a combine for a living, named his sons after the city where he sired them. Brad gives Howard a satellite system, but he winds up wrecking his father's house trying to install it.Things fare no better for Kate when they visit her mother, Marilyn (Mary Steenburgen of ""Stepbrothers""), who reveals the secrets of her daughter's past. Brad learns that Kate grew up as a goofy little fat child who got shipped off every summer to Fat Camp. Brad laughs hysterically at Kate's obese baby pictures and pokes fun at Kate's only friend, a butch gal pal, who wears an incriminating haircut. Worse, Kate's sister Courtney (Kristen Chenoweth of ""Stranger than Fiction""), divulges Kate's mortal fear of being trapped in an inflatable trampoline with the neighborhood kids who accused her of having cooties. Kate relives that horror after Courtney's infant barfs on her after a breast-feeding and sends her off to the bathroom for an apparel change. While she is in the bathroom, Kate experiments with a pregnancy kit, only to have Courtney's older daughter steal the kit and seek the sanctuary of a trampoline teeming with noisy urchins.As it turns out, Marilyn's latest beau is a Pentecostal minister, Pastor Phil(Dwight Yoakam of ""Sling Blade""), who wants volunteers to impersonate Joseph and Mary for their annual Christmas play. Marilyn volunteers Kate because her daughter played a tree in her high school play and Pastor Phil summons Brad to join her. A real child is thrust into Kate's arms, and she is clueless about what to do even when Pastor Phil provides her with instructions in the manger scene. Surprisingly, this church scene is played fairly straightforward with the laughs on our couple instead of what they are doing. Afterward, they visit Brad's mother, Paula (Sissy Spacek of ""Coal Miner's Daughter""), who has married Brad's best friend, collects New Age objects, and bakes marihuana in her brownies. Brad hates his best friend for tying the knot with his momma, and Kate roars when Paula tells her that Brad never wanted to stop breast feeding.Seth Gordon's claim to fame is a documentary called ""The King of Kong: A Fistful of Quarters"" about a father in the suburbs who struggles to rack up the highest recorded Donkey Kong video game score. The secret of Gordon's success with this hackneyed material is the way he maintains a swift pace so the gags follow each other in rapid succession.

There isn't one likable character in this movie, each one one of them all have their selfish tendencies, especially Vince Vaughn's whose character grated me to no end. I'm not a religious Christian or anything but I do believe in God, and I found some of the jokes very offensive, it's almost as if the Director couldn't stand God and cracked on him every chance he had. Witherspoon and Vaughn's chemistry is forced for starters and the only true laugh in the movie for me was at the start where they go and visit Duvall's family and Vaughn is setting up the satellite dish, I won't spoil it but it's pretty funny.Performances. Vince Vaughn is OK but to say his character is selfish is an understatement. The way he treated Reese in this film, I wanted to slap him on numerous occasions. Reese Witherspoon tries her best to be her usual charming self, but the script let's her down completely, she is better than this movie and I think she knows it. Robert Duvall looks bored with his character, and I didn't care for his character either. Sissy Spacek, Mary Steenburgen, Jon Voight,Jon Favreau, Dwight Yoakam, Tim McGraw make a great cast, but can do little with their respected parts. Kristin Chenoweth's character is annoying and despicable.Bottom line. I may be overly harsh with my evaluation of this movie to some, but I really did dislike this movie on a lot of levels. Christmas is supposed to be good-natured and fun, and while I enjoy devious humor, heck I even encourage it to go past the line, this was taking it way too far.4/10",-1,1,0,0,-999,1,0

Four Christmases,"Kate (Reese Witherspoon) and Brad (Vince Vaughn) have been together for three years and are still besotted with each other. Neither of them is particularly fond of their families, though (both sets of parents are divorced, so there are four families to contend with), which is why Kate and Brad make it a point to go on exotic vacations at Christmas, while telling their families white lies about doing humanitarian work. However, when fog grounds all Christmas flights and a TV news crew injudiciously broadcasts Kate and Brad, their cellphones immediately go off, leading to unwanted trips to all four households. And, as the trips proceed one by one, we learn why Kate and Brad avoid their families. They learn things about themselves and each other, and not all they learn is good news.First of all, this film is funny. There are a number of laugh-out-loud moments. And, importantly, much of the humour derives from character and situation. The small amount of bad language is mild, the vulgarity quotient is low, and the message is a positive one. It is maybe a touch over-sentimental but hey! c'mon, it's a Christmas movie! Actually, Christmas is merely the backdrop, the film is about something rather more fundamental than simply Christmas, and there is a great deal of truth in both the script and the performances.The cast is excellent, but special mention must go to Brad's Dad (Robert Duvall, very funny) and his two awful brothers, his Mother's boyfriend (an audible gasp in the theatre), and Kate's Dad (a dignified John Voight, delivering probably the most serious speech in the film).Vaughn has this sort of part nailed, and it's good to see his stock character no longer displaying the air of mild sleaze which has followed him in earlier films. Still, he has a wide range, and it would be good to see him stretched beyond this type of part: sympathetic as it may be, it doesn't really challenge him. Witherspoon always impresses, and continues to do so here.This comedy has some meat on its bones, is devoid of the witless coarseness which so many comedies seem to be built on these days, and has some heart - I recommend it.",1,1,1,0,0,1,0
Four Christmases,"Four Christmases (2008): Dir: Seth Gordon / Cast: Vince Vaughn, Reese Witherspoon, Robert Duvall, Mary Steenbergen, Sissy Spacek: Mediocre holiday comedy about getting the most out of life. That could be largely aided by just avoiding this film altogether. Vince Vaughn and Reese Witherspoon try to avoid family at Christmas but when they are unable too, they are put in a position where they must visit both sets of divorced parents in one day. This becomes a headache to them as well as those viewing the film. The premise is rushed but the concept was stale to begin with. Formula storytelling and a predictable outcome also fails to materialize this beyond the list of worst Christmas films. Director Seth Gordon is backed by fine performances by Vaughn and Witherspoon but veteran supporting cast that includes Robert Duvall and Mary Steenburgen are a waste. Vaughn must face certain facts that have the potential to threaten his marriage and other relationships, although one can understand his dismay at the reality of a former friend marrying his mother. Witherspoon now decides that she wants children, as if that must be the ultimate goal for a family. The veteran actors can only relish the shame that unfolds. Sissy Spacek in particular is a shameful waste barely uttering a word, but then again, this is a massive step down from Coal Minor's Daughter. Crammed together mess results in four times the waste of time. Score: 4 / 10",-1,1,0,0,-999,1,-999
Four Christmases,"Greetings again from the darkness. Vince Vaughn is starting to remind me of what Woody Allen went through ... ""I liked his funny movies"". Just wasn't a fan of ""Wedding Crashers"" or ""The Break-up"", but I certainly recognize his comedic talents. Here, his quirks play a little better, though I never really bought off on he and Reece Witherspoon as a couple.Low expectations, a strong cast, a few clever lines, easily relatable family strain, and a true sight ""gag"" make this one enjoyable enough. The trailer gives away the set-up of the film as Reece and Vince are forced to visit all four pieces of their disjointed families on Christmas. For some reason, director Seth Gordon (""King of Kong"") casts Robert Duvall and Sissy Spacek as VV's parents and Jon Voight and Mary Steenburgen as Reece's. The curiosity stems from the age difference between these actors ... a 15-16 year span. Just struck me as odd. Though not quite as odd as Jon Voight offering parental advice. Now THAT is comedy! Despite the hi-jinx, the messages abound: we all have the weirdest family, it is never easy to really connect with another person, and it's always a good time for cheese whiz. This is really VV's film as Reece has little to offer save for the bounce bounce scene. Mr. Vaughn is truly at his best in the moments of rapid fire dialogue as he helplessly tries to avoid another ridiculous situation.One warning to parents: the film is rated PG-13 and there is a segment regarding the Santa secret, so be forewarned. The unwritten rule is broken. The quick lines and uncomfortable family moments make this one worth a few giggles. Not a Christmas classic, but a decent comedy.I must mention the tribute to the classic ""A Christmas Story"" as the kids peer into the toy store window early on. That scene is followed by the airport scene, where the ticket agent is played by none other than Peter Billingsley, a grown up Ralphie from that movie (and producer of this film).",1,1,0,1,0,1,0
Four Christmases,"Brad and Kate have been together three years, in love, having fun, doing all sorts of things together with no intention of marriage or children.Christmas morning, they're on their way to Fiji, having told their two sets of divorced parents that they're off to do charity work.Through a fluke, they have no choice but to visit each of their four idiosyncratic parents.As the day progresses, Brad and Kate remember growing up, each learns more about the other And Kate realises that her life may not be as good as it could be...Pretty much everything you could expect from a Christmas movie starring Vaughn is in here. From his sarcastic tone, to his cringe worthy moments, nothing is left to the imagination. Vaughn makes the movie, and everyone else is along for the ride.Witherspoon has a look on her face as if to say, I can do funny as well as Oscar, but doesn't convince, so we are left with the notable actors playing the parents to notch up the laughs, as this is the fundamental part of the films story.It's a bit hit and miss. Thanks to Favreau, Duvalls segment becomes irritating very quickly, But Spacek and Steenburgens segments are by far the funniest and realistic. Voights is okay, but just a tad too late, and a little boring.So all in all, it's a typical Christmas movie, easy to watch, with some soppy message about family put into the mix.",1,1,1,0,0,1,0
Four Christmases,"... and I have no idea why. This is one of dozens of holiday films made over the last twenty years, and I don't get quite why that is true when Hollywood makes fewer films overall than they did in studio days before TV, yet there is a glut of these kinds of films versus the 30s through the 70s.It is completely predictable in its outcome. And that doesn't mean the fun is in the journey either because that is paint by numbers too. What you have is a yuppie couple played by Vince Vaughn and Reese Witherspoon who spend every Christmas on Fiji to avoid their dysfunctional families, but this year they are fogged in and stuck at home. A news crew interviewing them alerts their families to their availability and so they are forced to trudge to ""four Christmases"" since every parent is divorced and having their own Christmas. Both moms are oversexed in spite of being postmenopausal. Vaughn's dad is a lonely old man. Well, I should say he is a man alone because he seems quite happy in his solitary hermit existence.And in spite of the fact that the first three of these four gatherings are disasters, Witherspoon reveals to Vaughn that she probably does want to get married, that she does want to have kids. Vaughn quips that if anything should say they were right in traveling light through life it was the disaster that was today.I could say watch and find out what happens, but 98% of you will write the ending that happened without even seeing it.Why does Hollywood make these kinds of movies in the modern era? Maybe to make people feel better about themselves because their families couldn't possibly be this outrageous? To say ""Everyone else procreated and it was a disaster and so should I""? Maybe just because a sloppy script with cliched plot devices and Christmas lights pack them in during the Holidays and after all, isn't that the point?You won't be the worse for watching this because I guarantee you've seen it before under a different name, but I wouldn't seek it out if you can find a better film to watch.",1,0,-1,0,-999,0,-999
Christmas with the Kranks,"The trailer for the Tim Allen comedy ''Christmas With The Kranks"" (* out of ****)promises a lot more merriment that this yuletide yawner yields. ""America's Sweethearts"" director Joe Roth and ""Harry Potter"" scenarist Chris Columbus serve up strictly warmed-over, recycled laughs in this modern day rendition of ""Scrooge,"" and their gags lost whatever their spontaneity that they may have had over twenty years ago. Imagine how hilarious it is to see Tim Allen plunge off a roof as he struggles to place a huge snowman up there? Imagine how hilarious it is to see people fall down on an iced-over front lawn? Or how about the scene where a guy nearly electrocutes himself putting up Christmas lights? Of course, we're supposed to guffaw when Jamie Lee Curtis accidentally crashes a supermarket buggy into product display stand. The only thing worse than this hackneyed hokum is seeing both leads humiliate themselves by cavorting in Speedos and a bikini. Far past their athletic prime, Allen and Curtis should conceal all that cottage cheese. Things might have been funnier with younger leads. This half-cynical, half-sentimental drivel about an upper-middle-class, suburban, Chicago couple who decide to skip Christmas and take a Caribbean cruise plays like a 1950's tale of conformity in the Joseph McCarthy era when everybody feared that Communists were lurking under their bed. Predictably, ""Christmas With The Kranks"" celebrates the holiday on the alter of consumerism gone mad. Religious references are held to a minimum, and the message is that you should decorate your house so it resembles an intergalactic eye-sore with a constellation of multi-colored lights, snowmen, reindeer, and Saint Clauses. Bestselling author John Grisham's novel ""Skipping Christmas"" serves as the basis of this forgettable farce. Incredibly, there isn't a lawyer in the story or a scene in a courtroom! Luther (Tim Allen of ""The Santa Clause"" movies) and Nora Krank (James Lee Curtis of ""True Lies"") have spent the last 20 years celebrating Christmas with their daughter Blair (Julie Gonzalo of ""Dodge Ball"") in the Windy City with expensive house decorations and costly holiday social gatherings. As the movie opens, our protagonists bid their daughter goodbye. Blair has joined the Peace Corps and is heading off for South America. Christmas just isn't Christmas anymore, because their daughter has flown the coop. Luther gets to thinking about things. An upper-level manager at an accounting firm, he calculates that he drops $6-thousand dollars each year at Christmas on food, gifts, and parties. Luther discovers that for half the cost, Nora and he could spend ten days lounging in the Caribbean. No sooner has Nora okayed the idea than the neighbors start to harass our heroes about their anti-Christmas mind-set. A greeting card clerk berates Nora in a public restaurant for her refusal to buy seasonal cards. Their ward boss of a neighbor Vic Frohmeyer (paunchy Dan Aykroyd of ""Ghostbusters"") gives them withering looks, and the subdivision where they live tries to bully them into putting up Christmas lights and shelling out to charities. The Kranks even refuse to buy a police's calendar when two policemen (Cheech Marin of TV's ""Nash Bridges"" and Jake Busey of ""Starship Troopers"") come calling for their annual contribution. In fact, everybody in the neighborhood reacts with shock, suspicion, and contempt when the Kranks refuse to honor a holiday tradition. One character accuses the Kranks of being Jewish. Just as Luther and Nora battle their neighbors, they receive a phone call. Not only is Blair coming home suddenly from Peru, but she is also bringing a native that she plans to marry. Suddenly, Luther and Nora revert to tradition and their neighbors help them in their last minute attempt to deck their halls with boughs of holly. When ""Christmas With The Kranks"" isn't behaving anti-Semitic, the movie acts anti-African-American. Of course, any predominantly Caucasian subdivision in a movie must have its token black characters. A black couple loans Luther their Christmas tree because they are clearing out of town to stay with relatives.Director Joe Roth just doesn't know when he has beaten a stale gag to death. In one scene, the neighbors besiege the Kranks and demand that they bring out their giant snowman and display him on the roof. Luther and Nora dodge from room to room to avoid them, but the neighbors follow them from window to window. Later, an obnoxious neighbor (veteran character actor M. Emmet Walsh of ""Raising Arizona"") invites a truckload of gung ho Christmas carolers to serenade the Kranks with expected results. Worse, the humor sinks like lead and the story is so prefabricated that Allen, Curtis, and Aykroyd sleep walk through their one-note roles. One gag that gets repeated ad nauseam has Allen tromping on a cat's tail. Matters aren't helped when the cat owner turns out to be a poor old lady suffering from incurable cancer.""Christmas With The Kranks"" isn't worth a bah-humbug.",-1,-999,-1,-999,-999,-999,-999
Christmas with the Kranks,"Surprisingly funny film that i enjoyed. I went to go see this in theaters and it was worth it!. It's good natured and had lots of funny moments especially from Tim Allen and Jamie Lee Curtis (my favorite actress. It also had a good cast of supporting actors to help as well. It had some touching moments especially near the end , plus the fact that critics panned this movie i wasn't expecting a whole lot but i decided to go check it out in the theaters since Tim Allen and Jamie Lee Curtis were in it , and i was surprised big time!. SPOILERS!!! One of the funniest moments in the film was is when Jamie Lee Curtis finally gets the Hickory honey ham she wanted badly for Blair , and it rolls down the parking lot and a big truck squashes it , Tim Allen gave me lots of chuckles and whenever Blair phones and Jamie starts getting so excited. The acting is great!. Jamie Lee Curtis is is amazing as always and provides lots of laughs and as always did a Fantastic job!. Tim Allen is hilarious here and was perfect for the part and had good chemistry with Jamie Lee plus he does a really nice thing at the end!. Dan Aykroyd was good here and was also perfect for the part. M. Emmet Walsh adds class and was good. same goes for Elizabeth Franz. Erik Per Sullivan is okay here and didn't get on my nerves Cheech martin is good in his limited role Jake Busey is okay, Caroline Rhea and Autin Pendelton do fine in there limited screen time. Julie Gonzalo is EXTREMELY GORGEOUS!!! and does fine here. Overall Go see this in theaters ya might like it ***1/2 out of 5",1,1,0,0,0,1,0
Christmas with the Kranks,"Jamie Lee Curtis and Tim Allen are two talented actors who can do comedy well, but even their talents can't save this disappointing Christmas comedy. The premise of the movie did have some promise - as some critics have pointed out, it could have been a great satire on the notion of conformity and the commercialization of the Christmas holiday. Unfortunately, the execution pretty much botches the entire movie. I think the biggest problem is that the movie forgot to add heart. The Curtis and Allen characters come across as obnoxious, and their neighbors are not the least bit sympathetic or funny in their obsession that Christmas must go on. Another problem is that the filmmakers for the last twenty-five minutes or so ran out of ideas, resulting in the movie spinning its wheels trying to find some way to pad out the movie. Revolution Studios later went out of business, which means thankfully we will be spared a sequel to this misguided holiday movie.",-1,1,-999,-999,-999,-999,-999

When their daughter is unable to be home for Christmas, Luther and Nora Krank decide to skip the holiday to go on a cruise, which doesn't set well with the neighbors. The first problem with this garbage is the actions of the neighbors. They protest when the Kranks fail to place Frosty the Snowman on their roof. Why is this any of their business? They harass this couple in a way that is more disturbing than funny. The premise is rushed with jokes that fail miserably and an ending that is phony. Director Joe Roth does his best with the flimsy sets but Tim Allen and Jamie Lee Curtis labor under flat material. Both are terrific performers deserving of material worthy of their talent, which isn't this. Dan Aykroyd, M.

Christmas with the Kranks,"When Luther and Nora Krank (Tim Allen and Jamie Curtis respectively) decide to take a sea cruise in leu of having a Christmas of an kind, in part because their daughter Blair will be in the Peace Corps, their neighbors don't take the news particularly well, which draws the ire of Vic Frohmeyer (Dan Aykroyd) the self-proclaimed 'head of the neighborhood'. A battle of wits ensues (pardon my laughter, I just never thought I'd go nowhere NEAR typing the word 'wit' in relation to this movie).It's the little things that make this movie not worth watching. Such small nitpicks as Allen and Curtis not having any sort of chemistry whatsoever, and the film not being particularly funny or clever or what have you, but my biggest gripe is that the usually talented John Grisham choose to stray from what he does best (ie. courtroom dramas), but hopefully the mind-blowing travesty that this film is has proved for him not to deviate from his true talent.Where I saw it: Starz on Demand My Grade: D",-1,-999,-999,-999,-999,-999,-999
Christmas with the Kranks,"What kind of Christmas movie is this? Christmas With the Kranks is not jolly, whimsical, wholesome, or humorous like the typical American Christmas film, but a wretched, loathsome comedy capitalizing on the things the holiday season isn't about such as competition, self-centeredness, cruelty, and worst of all, conformity.The American Christmas movies fall in three possible categories, the great, the good, and the bad, like most films in specific genres, although it's quickly shortening to two, the good and the bad, with emphasis on the bad. Christmas classics are those such as A Christmas Story, It's a Wonderful Life, and White Christmas, which cloud the networks annually, with their cherishable whimsy, and incredibly earnest presence. Christmas trash are films like Christmas With the Kranks and Jack Frost; films that take a contrived, corny idea and make the near-fatal flaw of not satirizing their material and taking them seriously, creating a forced and awkward atmosphere. But this is just a grain of salt compared to the number of problems with this film.The films pairs Tim Allen and Jamie Lee Curtis, two wonderful stars playing two horribly unlikable characters, Luther and Nora Krank. They're a suburban couple who has just sent their daughter Blair (Julie Gonzalo) on a plane after Thanksgiving for a Peace Corps in Peru, leaving both of them to contemplate how to spend the Christmas holiday alone. Luther has a proposal; after spending well over $6,000 on Christmas decorations, he feels they could take a $3,000 cruise and have plenty to show for it. The only catch is that they'd miss Christmas, not decorate for it, and completely overhaul plans to host a party and send Christmas cards.Seems like a fine idea to me, but the film makes a controversial setup explode by having the neighbors (mainly the neighborhood ""king"" Vic Frohmeyer, played by Dan Aykroyd) overreact to the idea of the Krank's taking a year off. They are infuriated at their proposal, ostracizing them, manipulating them by excessive caroling, crowding around their house demanding they return ""Frost,"" an iconic staple of the neighborhood. Good lord, this is the kind of thing you do if you discovered noted hate-monger Fred Phelps was your neighbor. Not if you found out your neighbor simply wants to take a year off from Christmas by doing the kind, noble event of taking his wife on a cruise.The Krank couple is content with fighting them off, until their daughter calls a few days before Christmas and says she can make it home for the holidays with her new Peruvian fiancée. This sends both Luther and Nora into a scurrying state, accentuating the character trait I hate seeing portrayed cartoonishly and that's desperation. Desperation as a form of urgency and poignancy, where one character is genuinely at a loss and trying to do right but is consistently barricaded by unforeseen, unforgiving circumstances is one thing, but being played for laughs is another.In one terribly depressing sequence, we see Nora Krank, after being informed of her daughter's unexpected arrival, rushes to the grocery store to get hickory honey ham, because it's her daughter's absolute favorite. She races an old woman through the whole store (guess who gets the damn ham?), and then pleas a young couple with an infant to buy the ham off them for larger than the sticker price. Seeing Jamie Lee Curtis (In one what be her final starring role until 2010's You Again, which I hear was roughly the same degree of appalling as this one) desperately succumb to petulant beginning for a damned ham, as if the store didn't carry turkey or normal ham as a substitute, is incredibly unfunny. Then when she finally gets the family to cough up the ham for a large sum of money (after bringing up their kid's future), she is bumped and it rolls down the steep pavement into the middle of the road to be crushed by a sixteen-wheeler. Curtis then leads out a blood-curdling scream similar to the one she released in Carpenter's Halloween, when she had a better reason to shriek.The nail that drops into the coffin for this film is that it takes the somewhat original idea of portraying the Krank's as non-conformists, but then collectively makes them into the enemy to the point where they give in to the neighbors' orders of celebrating the holidays. Since when did celebrating Christmas have to involve a tree, lights, ornaments, parties, cards, caroling, and neighborly devotion? Since when did the message of being an individual and being unique, things we've been told since birth, be traded for the message of conformity by force? It's appalling to believe this film got past the stage of production, let alone the fact that Chris Columbus found this material acceptable to be placed on screen during the season of love and jolliness. It's also incredibly saddening to hear Columbus was the same man who directed both Home Alone films and the wonderfully potent Goonies. And please don't get me started on the persistent incorporation of unnecessary, grueling animal cruelty. It's unwarranted in almost any movie, but here, it's simply unacceptable.Christmas With the Kranks contains no laughs, humor, love, or anything resembling that of a competent holiday picture. It drains the talent of its two stars by making both of them succumb to something stupid such as Tim Allen's Luther getting botox, with a terribly unfunny sequence of him trying to eat something when it keeps falling out his mouth, and Jamie Lee Curtis' trying to get a tan in a mall tanning salon and finding herself exposed in the middle of the shop. Not only is this movie terribly not funny, but it's pathetically unconvincing; especially when it tacks on a mawkish ending that just oozes cutesy sentimentality.Starring: Tim Allen, Jamie Lee Curtis, and Dan Aykroyd.

Christmas with the Kranks,"It seems like on IMDb, a lot of people bash the newer Christmas movies, which in some ways I can understand, because most of the older movies could never ever be touched like A Christmas Story or It's A Wonderful Life, but I think we do need to be more open to these new family Christmas movies. I borrowed this movie from my friend and both her and I agree that it really wasn't all that bad. Although that it reminded me of another very bad 7th Heaven episode, I have to admit that I laughed a couple times, you have to just let up about these types of movies.The Krank's daughter, Blaire, has just gone away for the Peace Corps. and she will be away for a year, figuring it might be a good chance to think of only themselves, the parents decide to skip Christmas. But the Christmas loving neighborhood won't hear of it, they have their hearts set on getting the Kranks to love Christmas again and get all the decorations out along with the annual Chrismas Eve party they through. But they won't hear of it... until Blaire unexpectedly decides to come home for Christmas with a big surprise! Over all, I wouldn't say that this was a fantastic Christmas movie, but it wasn't a bad one at all. It had flaws, a lot of movies do, but we need to cut it a break. You have got to admit the botox scene with Tim was pretty funny, even if it was a little over the top.

Christmas with the Kranks,"In keeping with many Christmas-themed movies, ""Christmas With The Kranks"" has the almost obligatory heartwarming scene at the end where a person is magically transformed in some mysterious way and comes to realize the real meaning of Christmas (well, not the ""real"" real meaning - not the birth of Jesus, I mean - but the other ""real"" meaning; you know, being kind and generous and thinking about others - which is fine.) It was a nice ending as Luther Krank (played by Tim Allen) sacrifices something that was very important to him (a Caribbean cruise) in order to brighten the lives of an elderly couple with health issues and seeks nothing from them in return. Nice. I'm glad he did that. But aside from the obligatory Christmas transformation of the ""scrooge"" character, there was very little charm in this movie. As a parody of the secular Christmas I suppose it made some points, but it wasn't an especially fun or pleasant movie to watch, in spite of the efforts of a very talented cast - including Jamie Lee Curtis and Dan Aykroyd in addition to Allen.)There are two things going on here. The first is Luther's desire to just get away from the whole Christmas scene after daughter Blair (Julie Gonzalo) goes to Peru with the Peace Corps. To accomplish that he refuses to have anything to do with the trappings (including the giving and receiving of gifts - although, given his fanaticism on the issue, I wondered where the Christmas wreath on the front door came from!) of Christmas, but he does so in a rather cold-hearted way toward those friends and neighbours who normally partake of the Kranks' Christmas Eve party or his co-workers who normally receive gifts from him. Now, if Luther's boycott was intended to make a point about over-indulgence during the Christmas season, it might have worked, except that Luther simply wanted to take the money that he and Nora (Curtis) would normally spend on Christmas and treat himself (and Nora) to a fancy Caribbean cruise. So there's nothing noble about Luther's motives. They're totally self-serving. In contrast to Luther is the neighbourhood they live in, headed by the deceivingly friendly boss of the street Vic Frohmeyer (Aykroyd.) The neighbourhood apparently demands that everyone take part in meaningless rituals like putting up fake snowmen, and the absence of Frosty from the Kranks' home seems to be all that they really care about - and it reaches the point where the neighbourhood almost seems to become a frightening mob at their front door demanding Frosty's appearance, while Nora cowers in the bedroom. There's even a thinly veiled criticism of various charities and community groups (the Scouts and the Police Benevolent Fund come to mind) using the holiday to raise money, even though they have no particularly clear connection to Christmas. Yeah, there's a statement in all that, but it leaves no one in the movie especially likable.As Christmas movies go there are those that are more fun, and there are those that make the point far more clearly.

When Luther and Nora make the fatal mistake of foregoing Christmas (their daughter has joined the Peace Corps and won't be home for the holidays), all hell breaks loose in the community, with all the resident goons attempting to strong arm and browbeat the benighted couple into submission. Where's good old Scrooge when you need him? Watching ""Christmas With the Kranks"" is like finding a lump of coal in your stocking on Christmas morning; it makes you wonder what bad thing you did to deserve it. Instead of love and good cheer, we're treated to a witless holiday farce replete with labored slapstick and fake snow. All these neighborhood buttinskis are so annoying and irritating that they make you want to scream ""Get a life!"" every time they commit another holiday-related atrocity. Actually, given a more courageous set of filmmakers and a better script, ""Christmas With the Kranks"" might have been a slashing little satire on Christmas materialism (on the order of, say, a ""Bad Santa""); instead, it turns all feel-goody and mushy, converting the vicious neighbors into goody-two-shoe, Santa's Little Helper-types in time for the tear-soaked finale.Screenwriter Chris Columbus and director Joe Roth go for the lowbrow, easy laugh every time. Columbus even seems to be trying for a bit of that old ""Home Alone"" magic again by bringing in a couple of bumbling cops and a light-fingered jewel thief who burgles the upstairs bedrooms while a Christmas Eve party is in full swing below. Nothing works in this film, not the premise, not the humor, not the sentiment. The saddest thing is that the film wastes the talents of Tim Allen, Jamie Lee Curtis, Dan Aykroyd, M. Emmett Walsh, and Cheech Marin among others who probably signed on believing they were creating a Christmas classic that would live on through the ages. Instead, it joins all those other seasonal misfires like ""Santa Claus- The Movie,"" ""Jingle All the Way"" and ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas."" Ah well, you can always serve this instead of a stuffed bird for Christmas dinner. At least this turkey is not fattening.",-1,1,-999,-999,-999,-999,-999
Christmas with the Kranks,"But he sure seemed to have stolen the hearts and sense of humor of many who have watched and commented on this film. ""Christmas with the Kranks"" is a mostly clean, clever and witty, film without the vulgar and crass stuff of so many other more recent ""holiday"" movies. It's a great comedy that's fit for the whole family, although the humor will be mostly understood by the older kids and adults. I just came across the film when organizing my library, and recalled the poor rating it got but how much fun it was to me. So, these comments are written in the spring with the film still fresh in my mind – that's how good it is. What's not to like about this movie? It covers so much of what happens in middle America when Christmas rolls around. But, here's a family whose only child is grown and she's off to work in a social program in a foreign country. So mom and dad can skip all the usual holiday chores and regalia in their neighborhood, go away on a romantic cruise alone, and still save money. Then the complications set in, and what a hoot as Tim Allen and Jamie Lee Curtis go from one miscue to another with neighbors and friends. It's got a great cast, and everyone delivers well. What's funnier than Tim's fruit cocktail dribbling down his chin because he can't close his mouth to chew after receiving a Botox injection? Or, Jamie Lee stepping out of a tanning parlor dressed only in her bikini right in the middle of a mall crowd of onlookers – including her parish priest? Or Dan Aykroyd, the neighborhood ringmaster, organizing the rescue effort to set up the Kranks' Christmas house when daughter Blair changes her mind and flies home. This movie is full of gaffes and laughs, one-after-another, as Tim ""Grinch"" Allen gets back into the Christmas spirit with family and neighbors. Of all the very funny Christmas holiday movies over the years – there are some quite good ones a few decades back (black and white), I rank ""Christmas with the Kranks"" right behind the very best one – National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation. So, don't listen to the sour faces who have no sense of humor, or who don't dig clean fun. Watch this film with family and friends around the holidays this year and next – or at any time in between. Unless you're a Grinch, you're sure to enjoy it.",1,1,0,0,0,1,0
Christmas with the Kranks,"There is nothing better than a great Christmas movie. Everyone can name their favorite and there is nothing more nostalgic than watching your favorite Christmas special every year. It remains to be seen whether The Kranks will become one of those for us, or for me anyways. Christmas With The Kranks which I was stunned to learn, the novel from which it was based, was penned by the amazing John Grisham and the screenplay by the equally amazing Chris Columbus was a fun, heart felt, and often laugh out funny Christmas film. It had it's shortcomings as the critics are shoving in our faces but a Christmas film must be given some slack for being a seasonal film anyways.The story is The Kranks, Luther and Nora have had to say goodbye to their beloved Daughter Blaire as she moves on to the Peace Corp. Suddenly their empty nest syndrome kicks in and they realize their whole reason for having extravagant Christmas's is gone. Luther realizes that this is the perfect opportunity to leave it all behind and take his wife on a luxurious cruise of the Caribbean but in order to truly appreciate the Christmas cruise they will have to boycott Christmas altogether which sounds easy at first but they realize their Christmas happy neighbors, co-workers and town are not going to stand for it. Everything comes to a grinding halt when Blaire calls to say she is coming home for Christmas which changes everything. Now all they've worked towards avoiding they have to bring back, set up, get ready for and prepare the best Christmas ever!! Tim Allen is wonderful in this movie, probably the best of the cast. The character fits him so well and he doesn't come across as Tim Taylor which is always good. Jamie Lee Curtis who I love don't get me wrong but she didn't quite hit the note on this one. She was okay but she wasn't well matched with Luther and she wasn't given the best of scenes in the film, although her bikini scene was very funny. Dan Akroyd makes an unfortunately brief appearance as the ""mayor"" of the neighborhood who at first appears to be hassling them but in the end rallies everyone to their support. The movie dragged a little, it's slightly longer than expected and the beginning of it was a little off putting. It felt like it was going to suck basically. But it got so much better half way through and ended perfectly. From the moment of the hilarious carolers outside their house, the movie was funny, heart warming, and fun to watch. The dialog felt forced at times and some of the gags did as well but it was still fun to watch. Throw in some necessary Christmas magic, and a little heart warming moment of Christmas realization and the film is wonderful. I can't wait to see it again next Christmas. I often wondered if Grisham or Columbus wasn't trying to be a little satirical at parts with the neighborhood perfectly aligned and snow perfectly placed. It felt like maybe they were poking a little fun but nonetheless it's a great family, Christmas movie. I also think they should have stuck with the title ""Skipping Christmas"" but that doesn't effect it much I suppose. Check it out!! 7.5/10",1,1,0,0,0,1,0
The Wire,"I have seen many brilliant shows, and The Wire is one of them. Even the word brilliant isn't enough to put into words how good this series is. The Wire is incredibly well made, with moody lighting, striking location work that also brings atmosphere and great photography, while the music is very haunting. The Wire with its thoughtful and tense dialogue also has some of the best writing of any show I've seen, the stories are ceaselessly compelling and the characters are rich and unforgettable. All the episodes are superbly directed, and very rarely do you feel cheated at the end of episodes. The acting is superb, Dominic West and Idris Elba are especially brilliant. In conclusion, phenomenal. 10/10 Bethany Cox",1,1,1,1,1,1,1
The Wire,"This HBO series is incredible. Journalist David Simon takes his reporting experiences to create this crime show about cops and the drug world in the urban Baltimore. It's a complex entanglement of police, politics, and criminals. The different story lines work together. It's filled with great characters. Detective Jimmy McNulty (Dominic West) is the cop obsessed with taking down the drug trade. On the other side are drug dealers Avon Barksdale (Wood Harris) and Stringer Bell (Idris Elba). Of course, the most memorable is Omar.The difference between this and other TV crime shows may be the realism that's invested not just on the good guys, but also the bad guys. The best example is Omar. He's a feared loner gangster, but he's very much a human being. It lasted 5 season, and it's quite compelling throughout its run. Although the loss of Avon Barksdale at the end of the third season did cause some disruptions. There is always a great sense of realism in the show.",1,1,0,1,0,1,0
The Wire,"I have written individual reviews for each season of this as I have gone through them and, having finished the fifth and final season, I wanted to review the entire series as a finished product  which it sadly now is. I came to The Wire as many people have  on DVD for the first seasons till I was caught up and joined it on FX UK. It was the constant critical praise for the show that attracted me but I was still wary that it would be mostly hype and that a ""good"" show would be undone in my mind due to the weight of expectation. The first few episodes offer you nothing like 24's exploding plane to hook you or thrill you and a colleague of mine bailed out after one episode, describing it as ""people mumbling for an hour"". I can sort of understand this because you do not start watching The Wire thinking ""this is awesome"" but within 3 or 4 episodes you suddenly realise that you are in the middle of a densely populated story that develops character and plot with the deftest of touches.It is not one ""moment"" or a matter of having sufficient good moments to make the show but just the sheer depth and consistency of writing across each and every episode. Season 5 is the only significant loss of this and even when this happens (as it does too frequently in S5) it still leaves a ""very good"" show. Seasons 1-4 are near perfect though and the show is endlessly complex, intelligent, exciting and thrilling. Again this is not to suggest that it has ""big"" moments that stand-out such as action sequences (although it does) but that you will be drawn into the story and characters to such an extent that you will find a four minute review of a crime scene with the dialogue variations on the F word to be fascinating and enthralling.However it is not one or two characters that are well drawn but rather almost all of them are convincing and engaging. West's McNulty is of course the ""main"" character and his superior, drunken sh1t-stirrer is very real but the show provides just as much fleshing out for minor cops, politicians, drug lords, corner kids, junkies and thieves. Royo's Bubbles is another great character than is very much the emotional heart of the show, never letting us dismiss users as just ""junkies"". I won't start listing others because it would fill the review but special mention to Stringer Bell, who is wonderful, season 3 in particular. The one exception to the ""realism"" of the show is Omar, who is a fantastic creation of cocky control and cool  he doesn't fit that well into the world created but he is still a lot of fun and the writers ensure that season 5 sees him harshly brought back into the world that all the other characters inhabit. The acting is roundly excellent and fans may have forgotten that the cast doesn't feature many faces you will know apart from a couple from Homicide etc, but yet this approach works because it allows us to only know Elba as Stringer, West as McNulty, Doman as Rawls, Pierce as Bunk and so on. They are well served by the writers and they respond to it accordingly; the only depressing thing is that for many of them they will never have it this good again.I will not go on about it because I think that The Wire doesn't need my praise and my hype to tell people that it is good. Generally I have found that the best way to do that is to put the DVD in someone's hand and tell them to give it three hours of their time as a start  after that few have given up on it but rather have gone on to watch all five seasons. People can tell a product of quality when they see one, and that is what The Wire is. It may have been completely ignored by the Emmys and other major awards but it does and will have the last laugh because this is a show that will stand for decades as one of the finest ever made. Do yourself a favour and get ahead of those who will discover it when it starts topping ""best of"" lists and give it a chance now because once you are drawn into it you will agree that it is nothing less than awesome.",1,1,1,0,0,1,0
The Wire,"We sometimes might wish to be able to hear what certain people are saying. Obviously you can't just do that, even if you are police and you want to convict criminals. You have to prove that those individuals are indeed breaking the law. And even then, you might not be able to get the Wire ... This show takes its time, because it was able to do that. And it's all the better for it. You might not think that a single episode is standing out particularly, but the whole construct is great indeed.Still even though it has that certain quality to it, you might not like the show, because this is close to reality (criminals not just shooting any cop they see or many shootouts in general). There is still action and still death ... and when that happens the impact is even greater. Because we get to see both sides. The cops and the bad guys .. both have their good sides and their bad sides. Yes even the ""bad guys"" are not just evil.I only had a chance to listen to one audio commentary so far (most things were apparent watching the show itself, like no added music other than the one that might be in the scene, i.e. radio car, no flashbacks, except one that had to be done under pressure and so forth ... all adding to the realism of the show), but the show portrays people and they don't feel like characters. It does not happen often that I do remember character names of a show or a movie I watch. Maybe a couple, if I did dig the character/movie ... but with the Wire, I could name at least a dozen.A great show that takes its time, written based on real life ... but in a good sense. This is really incredible and if you have the stamina to work your way through it, it is more than rewarding ... Changes or not, life is life ... whether someones listening in to you or you're listening (watching) into other peoples lives ...",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
The Wire,"I'd heard of The Wire long before it was finally aired on British network television, all of the things I'd heard were good. Often glowing reviews lead to high expectations which aren't quite met... that wasn't the case here, The Wire lived up to its reputation as one of the best television shows ever. It helped that all five series were shown over a few months as opposed to five years so there was no opportunity for the viewer to lose track of who was who in the large cast.At first glance it might appear that the this is just another cop show but it is far more than that, not only does it show both sides of crime, which is unusual, it shows how that crime permeates through the City of Baltimore: politicians want the statistics massaged so it looks like they are doing something about the ever constant crime but don't want to supply the money to do something really useful, the schools where the children are being taught how to pass the tests but not learning anything that will help them escape the life in the drug trade they seem to be destined for and a political system where everybody is just trying to get into higher office and keep it once they get there.With a large cast played mainly by actors I didn't know it might be expected that it would be hard to keep track of who was who. Luckily the cast all did a great job so that even though I couldn't remember every name it was easy to remember how they fitted into the story. While I don't think there were any weak actors there were many who stood out; Dominic West brought a degree of humour to the series as Detective McNulty, Idris Elba as ""Stringer"" Bell, the drug dealer who wanted to keep things low profile and businesslike rather than a constant war and Felicia Pearson who was brilliant as ""Snoop"", a senior member of one of the drug dealing gangs who thinks nothing of killing anybody who even vaguely threatens them. I have a feeling that a lot of the cast will go on to become well known in many roles as they have proved themselves so well here.I certainly recommend this to anybody who enjoys serious drama that isn't of the ""case of the week"" variety, be warned however there is a lot of swearing and violence that some viewers may not be comfortable with although none of it seemed gratuitous to me. While it may not have won awards I am certain people will still be talking about this years after the programmes that won the awards are forgotten.",1,1,0,0,0,1,0
The Wire,"The streets of Baltimore as a microcosm of the US's war on drugs, and of US urban decay in general. Seen not only through the eyes of a few policemen and drug gang members but also the people that influence and inhabit their world - politicians, the media, drug addicts and everyday citizens.Brilliant series. Started slowly and without an indication of how good it would become. While not bad, Season 1 wasn't that riveting. So uncompelling was it for me that I didn't watch Season 2 until several years later, and am now glad I did. In Season 2 we see the genius of David Simon and Ed Burns at work, with a script that is thoroughly engaging. It is here that it becomes obvious that this more than just a crime-drama series, it's a human-drama series (and the humans involved happen to largely be policemen and drug dealers). Incredibly gritty and plausible.Seasons 3 and 4 demonstrated that no character is indispensable and nothing is predictable about the series. Every time I figured I could see the way ahead, which characters would carry the series into the next season and/or what the overarching storyline for the remaining series would be, the show took a turn in another direction. Not twists for twists sake, just good, plausible plot development.Throw in superb performances by everyone involved and you have an incredible series.Season 5 was a bit disappointing in that it wasn't quite the powerful ending I was expecting. The fake serial killer angle felt silly and implausible and was overplayed. Remainder is very good, but that took the shine off the final season. Ultimately, however, the series is a classic of TV drama.",1,1,1,0,0,1,0
The Wire,"The Wire, in its totality, was depressing in a rage-against-the-machine kind of way. It was an exploration of the drug scene in Black communities in a way I haven't seen since New Jack City, but even more gritty and raw. The Wire showed a side of Baltimore that you pray is dramatized. And when the series concluded there was a gaping hole where hope and optimism used to be.The main focus of the show was drugs--the dealers, the users, the suppliers, the cops, the politicians and those directly and indirectly affected by it all--while various other stories were a supplement. That was the back drop for the series. The players changed but the game remained the same. Affixing itself to the drug sphere were politics, politicians, the justice system, the police, the docks and dock workers, the kids and the Baltimore Sun (Baltimore's main newspaper).All of these entities were on display just to show how far the tentacles of corruption and seediness can reach. Everyone is part of a game of some sort but only the dope dealers admit it and only the dope dealers' game has only two conclusions: prison or death. Everyone else's game can end in promotions, recognition, pay raises and retirement, but in the dope game there are no such luxuries. At my job we have a saying: ""Screw up to move up."" That saying was born because so many screw ups have found a way to move up the ladder whereas on the streets that would never happen. The dope dealers openly say, ""this is all part of the game,"" whereas as the politicians, the brass, the various titles in the various professional fields were all running game without voicing it. They have slightly different rules, slightly different risks and slightly different goals, but they all were scheming and running game.The series wrapped up leaving me despondent. It left me with the feeling of: this machine is too big and running too strong to stop it or even slow it down. The more things change the more they stay the same. One corrupt politician is replaced by another, one dope fiend by another, one dope dealer by another, one puppet commissioner by another, one lost child by another. Very little was offered by way of hope and progress. And when a glimmer of hope began to shine we found out that it too was false.As a whole it was awfully depressing, but such is life. Those you root for to win don't always win and those you root for to lose don't always lose. It's funny because each episode began with a printed quote from one of the characters and although I read them, I never tried to tie it to the story. The final episode had a quote from Snoop; it read, ""Deserve ain't got nothing to do with it."" Boy was that true and on display in caps, bold, italicized and underlined. Does doing the right thing deserve to be punished? Does corruption deserve to go unpunished? Do liars deserve to be rewarded? Does honesty deserve to be chided?A big part of the appeal of The Wire was its authenticity. And it's that very same authenticity that would prevent me from letting my kids watch this show. Even if we took away the language, the violence, the drugs and the nudity; we were left with a very bitter message: it doesn't matter if you do right or not, the game is rigged. Don't try to fix it, you'll only be destroyed in the process and the cycle will continue. My children would glean a very morbid message from this show and an idea that the path to success lies in treachery, deceit and underhandedness. There were few characters I genuinely liked, there were mostly characters I hated and those I didn't hate as much. Occasionally, I'd root for one character I loathed to eliminate another character that I loathed more. Of course things didn't work out that way. This was no movie with everyone getting their just deserts in the end. This show was about a broken system with no one with the courage to fix it, and those that did have the courage didn't have the power. Put that in your pipe and smoke it.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
The Wire,"HBO's ""The Wire"", another ground breaking TV crime series from David Simon who grandfathered ""Homicide: Life on the Street"", raises the bar for crime dramas by dedicating a whole season (13 episodes) to a single story with unparalleled realism. Telling of a motley bunch of detectives who set about to bring down a Baltimore drug ring which supplies a black innercity housing project, the gritty 12 hour first year series slowly develops a broad range of characters from street punks to senators in a world where the blacks and whites of good and evil are reduced to shades of gray and everyone is connected by their humanity for better or for worse. Not the usual cops vs bad guys fare with episodic ups and downs, ""The Wire"" is one long drama about people which happens in a law enforcement and crime setting. For realists only, this series will require some viewer patience while the complexities of the plot and the characters are developed. One of a kind...so far. (A)",1,0,0,1,0,0,0
The Wire,"""The Wire"" is a 60 hour-long novel, divided into five parts by its five seasons. Deep, complicated and interwoven, the series has a huge cast, all of whom are connected by multiple, overlapping and intersecting plot lines. Though the show initially takes the form of a standard ""cops and criminals"" tale, it soon becomes apparent that these lowly figures are mere pawns on a vast chessboard, the series gradually expanding to tell the story of an entire neoliberalized post-industrial city, and the institutions that attempt to serve it.We begin in the The Baltimore Police Department, an institution at the mercy of both a political obsession with the war on drugs and its own endemic incompetence. From here we expand to incorporate life on the streets, observing the street level foot-soldiers, the middle management lieutenants and the upper echelon barons of the drug trade. ""The Wire"" then turns its gaze to the longshoreman unions at the Baltimore docks, all of whom are suffering from a drop-off in commercial traffic and who unknowingly act as couriers for narcotics coming into the city. We then turn to the public schools, its inhabitants locked in a cycle of crime and poverty. This is a battleground between valiant teachers, disillusioned students and an indifferent City Hall. The series then expands further, turning its sights to the Democratic Party Machine and local newspapers. These institutions are likewise plagued by corruption and back scratching. Indeed, when an idealistic new Mayor comes onto the scene, he is promptly stymied by the crippling deficits left over by his predecessors and by political jockeying in the Police Department.It is important to note that the series focuses almost entirely on places of work, ""The Wire"" interested in the way in which the conflicts inside the state apparatus mirror those within the criminal communities. This includes not only the influence of the police on the illegal, subalternized capitalist economy, but also the ways in which the latter (through bribery, loans and money-laundering) underwrites the upper echelons of the state through the circulation of its accumulated wealth (at which point it becomes finance capital).So ""The Wire"" portrays a world caught up in an epic Darwinian struggle, the weak crushed whilst the strong are swiftly promoted. If crime as an analogy for business has become so common that it has morphed into an empty truism, ""The Wire"" at least reflects the fluctuating, noxious nature of contemporary capital. Gangsters who cling to old codes of acquisition are supplanted by savvier outfits who take the form of a kind of all-grasping oligopoly. But as fast as one cartel rises, it is replaced by yet another, each successive cartel more ruthless than the other. Significantly, all these gangsters rely on a mixture of old-style terror cell tactics (few people in the gang know the contacts of anyone else), modern technology and complex codes. This is not organized crime, this is business warfare, the gangs replicating state-like repressive structures that, like a legitimate organization, are ferociously hierarchal and strategically meritocratic.At its best, ""The Wire"" is a work of urban anthropology that attempts to show how the ""invisible hand"" of the market stretches out across an entire city. Unlike most crime films, which zoom in on ""one of 8 million stories"" (The Naked City), ""The Wire"" gently zooms out, attempting to trace commodities as they change hands and states. Context is king, but this desire for super-objectivity poses a problem, for the larger the society it attempts to reconstruct and incorporate into its narrative, the less socially explanatory ""The Wire's"" vision becomes. Everything is wired, everything is connected, but the more we zoom out, the more invisible these wires become.The cast recognises this, of course. As the detectives ""follow the money"" throughout the series, they eventually get lost in a world that has simply become too huge, too labyrinthine, for them to process. They trace the money from the streets to the skyscrapers, eventually getting lost in the tangle. It thus soon becomes clear that policing both bolsters an unjust status quo and represents a profound disavowal on the part of the state. Law enforcement (which ignores the circulation of capital) involves the fabrication of the ""otherness"" of the criminal, whilst the flow of money makes it clear that the supposed ""other"" is in fact constitutive of the state.Late in the series, when the detectives find the lair of one gangster, they are surprised to find no signs of crime. This is because the gangster has ""laundered"" his lifestyle, his money now having no connection to the drug world. This is the legal, whitewashed face of criminality, highlighted by the presence of Adam Smith's ""The Wealth of Nations"" on the gangster's bookshelf, a symbol which effectively links the sanitized world of finance with commodity exchange on the violent streets, capital changing hands, laundered and re-invested ad-infinitum.So these aren't ordinary gangsters. These are gangsters who study Business Administration and discuss the ""elasticity of demand"". Success in the criminal world is directly linked to feeding the consumer's desire. But though the gangsters largely supply product to drug addicts, they themselves are addicts, for they ruthlessly desire to accumulate.But not all ""The Wire's"" gangsters are the same. Some represent a tendency towards the formation of cooperative dealerships, others care only about self-interest, self-reliance and personal control, whilst others prefer instead to impose their own more neoliberal economy. Finally, there's a gangster called Omar, who represents a more romantic ""Robin Hood"" version of crime, taking advantage of the mistrust generated between the corporate and competitive styles, using guerrilla tactics to trick and rob local kingpins. On one hand, Omar becomes a local myth in his own short lifetime, but on the other, he violently debunks the myth of original accumulation.10/10 – ""The Wire"" has both rendered most previous crime/gangster movies obsolete, and set a trend for all modern crime films.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
The Wire,"I have finally finished the complete series. It took me a month to watch it completely, and it was completely worth it. I am going to try and write a decent review and do the series justice, but I don't know if I will be able to.At first, The Wire is merely a very pretty good show that has a lot of different characters and story lines. I appreciated it and enjoyed it to a minimal extent, but never truly loved it. Even after the first season I wasn't entirely in it's grasp. I felt sort of the same feeling with the second season. I think that this season is definitely the season with the most different tone. Point being, I stuck with it because I could sense what type of show this was- a slow-burner. Somewhere between the third and fourth season I realized what a great achievement this was. It wasn't that the series was improving. I wouldn't say that at all. It was just that it was me. I had gotten familiar with it, with the characters, story lines, and themes and realism it brings. Sure enough, the feeling the show brought at the end of each episode was that of complete satisfaction. It never went for cheap thrills, or cheap manipulation or emotion. It demanded attention and time, and at the end I would be getting my 'paycheck' so to speak. I can definitely see why many people have seen the first couple of episodes and then tuned out. I am extremely grateful that I stuck by it to the end.Without giving any spoilers, I want to talk about the actors here. Completely unrecognizable, and had never seen them before (besides Idris Elba). Yet, I don't remember any important character being played lousy or falsely. There are so many excellent performances here. The performances of the 'street' characters, like Omar, Bubbles, Stringer, D'Angelo, Avon, and Snoop to the performances of the 'heroes'- McNulty, Greggs, Daniels, Freamon, Carver, Bunk. Then there are those who appeared based on their institution by season- the politician Thomas Carcetti, the high-class elite of 'the Greek' and the Sobotkas, the school kids Michael, Naymond, Randy and Dookie, and the news media- Gus Haynes and Scott Templeton. There is a large number of characters that are as compelling as any imaginable. I also want to give a shout out to the cinematography, which never became colorized or stylized. One might say it looked 'dull' compared to other big cable shows, but it only added to the meaning of the TV series. Ultimately, The Wire probably joins together with Breaking Bad as the best television shows I have ever seen. It's uncompromising, honest, brutal, realistic, and ultimately completely rich in it's meaning. Words cannot express just what I mean by that, but hopefully people seek it out.",1,1,1,0,0,1,1
The Wire,"When a series is as widely praised as 'The Wire', it might be useful (from a British perspective) to compare it with our own top cop shows. And in terms of strength of characterisation, it gets only a middling mark. The characters are all strong, but you can never altogether escape the sense that they've been designed to fill a role, and some of the dialogue is just a little too crisp for real life. Watch my own favourite police show, 'The Cops', and you'll see how, for all 'The Wire's much-feted realism, there's still a faint coating of gloss on the grime; and no single character is as interesting (or as well-played) as Jayne Tennyson in 'Prime Suspect'. But this does not mean that 'The Wire' does not deserve praise. 'Prime Suspect', in spite of pretending to be a police procedural, in fact used all the usual hackneyed plot devices of televisual thrillers. 'The Wire', by contrast, tells a highly plausible story, and maintaining this single story over 13 hours without the slightest resort to melodramatic cliché is a fine achievement. The program also deserves credit for attempting, within the scope of fiction, to seriously explore the dreadful state of America's neglected, and often ignored, underbelly. This makes 'The Wire' a rare, and serious, program; but also a fine drama whose tension mounts if you're prepared to wait for it.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0
The Wire,"One of the great TV series, The Wire is an exploration of crime, policing, corruption, and politics. Seasons tend to focus on particular investigations, but they are more about exploring the nature of an aspect of Baltimore and its struggles. The first episode focuses on the drug trade, the next on corruption and compromise on the loading docks. The series takes long looks at the school system and the nature of political compromise.One interesting thing is that nothing ends. Characters jailed in one season are followed into prison in the next. Cops that lose their jobs are followed into new professions. It is as though the shows world simply keeps growing, constantly growing new roots that reach into new areas.The series also avoids the typical cop tropes. Cops are frustrated when the law slows their progress, but they don't make speeches about how if the government would just get out of the way they could get stuff done. Instead, cops generally accept that there are rules they have to follow because that's just what the job is.The Wire is unrelentingly honest about the Sisyphean task of the police. The first episode follows the successful hunt for a drug kingpin, but the last episode shows that, with him off the street, the drug market still flourishes. It is a message given over and over.The Wire isn't perfect. I found the early episodes of season 3 less than engrossing, and the final season was rather ridiculous, although still reasonably entertaining. The final of the drug bosses was its least interesting. But these are minor complaints about a show whose fully-drawn characters, gritty realism, and intriguing stories make it one of the great series of the modern age of television.",1,0,1,0,0,0,0
The Wire,"The first episode of ""The Wire"" was really boring to me. I was at the edge of giving it up after 20 minutes, and I was almost sure that I won't continue to watch it further than the pilot. Then, I decided to give it a chance because of its reputation and I was hooked. Unlike other crime series where every episode has own, more or less independent plot, while all are connected by common background or group of main characters, here the whole season is one story, like an extremely long movie. Just imagine one episode of some crime show stretched to 13 hours. Of course, it will seem boring at the start, but at the other hand, this approach gives authors a chance to develop every aspect of the story to the smallest details and to do a deep characterization of every character and their mutual relationships and backgrounds. Combine this with excellent cast capable to carry this kind of story and with extreme level of realism, without good guys and bad guys, just regular people with all their virtues and flaws, whose lives took various paths and took them to opposite sides of drug war, and you'll get strong and deep human drama. This is not a crime show, this is a heavy drama that tries to show the reality of people in the specific surrounding. I will restrain from rating, at least until I'm done with the first season, but it seems it will justify its reputation. Give it a chance. It takes just a little patience to get through the introduction and once you are pulled in you'll see it was worth it.* * * *Last night I finished the first season. You know that feeling when it hurts that there's no more. I mean, yes, there are four more seasons, but if I understood right, they are independent stories without connection to previous seasons. I don't have a feeling that I just finished the show, but more like I spent whole life with those people. It's like I personally know and love every single one of them and now they are all gone at the same time and I miss them badly. I'm not sure I can go that far to say it's the best TV show ever made, especially before I go through all five seasons, but it surely is pure 10/10. And nonetheless movie 10/10. Cause in every aspect, except for its length, this is more one big movie than a regular TV show. Anyway, this is something everyone should see, regardless of personal taste and interest, in the same way as everyone should read Dostoevsky. This is, or surely will become, classic for all times.10/10",1,1,1,0,0,1,0
The Wire,"This series is very difficult to cover or review because of the period when it was produced. That was under President George W. Bush and it started being aired after 9/11. The second fact is that we have to, understand Baltimore is a very special urban community where the African American population is vastly dominant. Let's consider only the period before and during the broadcasting of this series. In other words, the whole city was a ghetto and the Black population was of course in the worst and most derelict neighborhoods.African American population
in Baltimore
Year Percentage
1990 59.2%
2000 64.3%
2010 63.7%We also have to understand that a second demographic group was dominant in Baltimore and this is very clear in the first two seasons and still present, though more on the side, in the three latter seasons. And that will be the main problems considered in the first two seasons.The first two seasons have to do mainly with the Harbor of Baltimore, a harbor that is dying at the time because it is entirely controlled by an absolutely corrupt Dockers' Union held by two mafias, the Polish and the Greek mafias in Baltimore with vast connections across the East Coast and the US. Their general way of trafficking is simple. It mostly uses containers brought in by container ships. One container, only known of the dockers' union people, has to disappear from the computerized log as soon as it is lifted from the ship. That particular container gets out of the harbor untraced and is delivered to some criminal network. Either the goods in the container are the front hiding drugs inside fridges for example, or whatever can be a proper case or vessel for heroin or cocaine packs. Or the goods are just blocking the vision of a specially devised back compartment that is not even ventilated so that no one can suspect foul play, and in this compartment, a certain number of women are hidden to be delivered to some prostitution rings.It all came out when one of these unaccounted women came up dead in the harbor waters, and when a whole load of women was discovered dead in a container. It took two seasons to corner the dockers' union chief who was the main organizer and beneficiary of this human trafficking, him and his family, mainly cousins or nephews once, twice or more removed. At that time the series was not so much concentrating on the Black community, but that changed completely when the harbor mafia was brought down, which I believe was only possible because the harbor itself was totally bankrupt because instead of using the profit of this commerce to invest to remain up at the top in the severe competition in the field of maritime container commerce that started raging in the world with the emergence of Asian companies and the rejection of flags of convenience, and in this last case the Greeks were number one. This evolution killed many harbors that did not follow the trend and it brought down Greece as a nation when that maritime traffic and industry collapsed in Greece, revealing the deep unhealthy social situation there. It took ten years to clean up the Augean stables and to bring the country and nation back on track. It also took the selling of the Piraeus harbor to the Chinese for it to become clean and profitable.When this situation was dealt with, finished, classified, then the series turned to the situation of the African American community. It finally decided to go ""way down in the hole"" and check how it was in that ghetto. It insists mostly on the completely abandoned neighborhoods in the black section of the city that are not even safe as buildings, that are sometimes vacated in order to be pulled down but never get demolished and end up boarded up and being used by squatters or coffins for murdered gangsters. And the situation is so desolate that it would take pages to describe this vast urban wasteland with tens of thousands of people, mostly children, teenagers, and women, living in such conditions.The second problem is drugs. Drugs are under the control of Black traffickers, at grassroots level (at street corners because a street corner provides four ways to run if you have to, instead of just two, and one being blocked by the oncoming gang fighters or police patrols, three escape routes in one case and only one in the other case, so it has to be street corners) and at middle level, that is to say, Baltimore, the city and the direct area around it, with necessarily a higher level which is either Black and in New York, or Polish and Greek and it is an invisible and unidentified white network at a wider level. That means Baltimore is the battlefield of two or three gangs trying to take control of the whole city and at the same time, they have been obliged to accept some kind of zoning policy. This situation is a pure and simple war situation with constant guerrilla warfare and firearms killings. The gangs can only survive and keep some balance if they regularly kill some of the underlings or small captains of other gangs, each gang against the two or three other gangs. This leads to one or two or three leaders who are untouched and untouchable. Normally. Sooner or later there is always someone who will have the guts or the unconscious dumbness to kill a chief. To do that this kamikaze had better be young and small because all adults or even teenagers, not to mention all women, are suspicious and cannot approach the ""bosses.""The third problem, that could be the solution, is education. No money, no qualified teachers, no policy, no means of any sort to bring this black population out of their total cultural fallow wasteland where becoming a corner operator is the only future they can imagine if they are boys, and being a ghetto courtesan of some kind, in other words, for anyone who wants such services, if they are girls. Some teachers believe they can make a difference but we are in the years of the Iraq war and trillions of dollars have to be found to pay for this never-ending war so that federal money was becoming scarce for education and other services, the police particularly as we are going to see. As for education, there is no real possibility to educate these young people out of the ghetto, out of poverty, and we have to be clear on one point: the drug traffickers, the holdup bandits, the hijackers, the kidnappers, all of them are Black in the ghetto and all their victims are Black too. The gangs are not exploiting the whites. They are exclusively exploiting the Blacks, and from time to time but rarely victimizing Asians. This is the acme of capitalistic greed and exploitation. The whole series does not give us one single case of a child becoming a teenager and managing to get out of this ghettoic rawkus alienation through education. We are not even shown any picture of a college in this city of Baltimore. Colleges are off-limits.That leads to the last problem: the police. Under the Black mayor in three seasons, the police have money for overtime and cars, but it is in the hands of the friends, associates and buddies of the Black mayor. If you are not Black, no way up except if you accept to do the dirty work of covering up the extraordinary level of crime, particularly blood crime, in the city. It is this rotten situation that brings in 2004 or 2006 a new Black District Attorney who is supposed to be clean. How long will it last? And a new white mayor who captures a section of the Black vote by promising a special effort for the schools and special treatment for the police that would be cleaned up. But that mayor is a mayor and of course, he is a politician with ambition, and within two years he manages to be elected governor of the state of Maryland. He keeps part of his promise for schools, though we are not shown the result. But he does not keep his promise for the regeneration of the police, and this time a couple of impatient rebellious cops, one white, one black, cheat with their police department, with the city council and with the press: they use illegal wire-tapping equipment to be able to penetrate the communication among the top leaders of the gangs to manage the tracking of a special delivery. But they need extra personnel, extra cars and extra money for overtime. To achieve this target they create from nothing at all a serial killer fable among the homeless in the city, by using and manipulating the killing of homeless people mostly by other homeless people and mostly for petty grievances, and by attaching a red ribbon to the wrist of a few victims, organizing the ""fake kidnapping"" of a wasted distant cousin of one of these two cops. The press is im-'press'-ed and reacts at once, revealing a lot about these homeless people and at the same time bringing a lot of attention to the police situation that cannot cope with such problems. The two cops get the means they want to fight against this phantasmatic serial killer, and they use these means to corner and arrest the main Black drug leader and capture an enormous delivery of cocaine and heroin, plus a great number of underlings. One of the middle-of-the-way underlings will accept to take several murders under his responsibility, the main leader could be concerned with, but an important white lawyer often defending the gang people is revealed to be corrupt too at grand jury level, and then this lawyer, the DA office and the white female deputy (who is the mistress of the Black deputy police chief I am going to deal with later, and this one is married to a Black lady who wants to make a career in Baltimore's politics and eventually become Mayoress, isn't that all simple?) work out a deal. The main gang leader will walk free and keep his capital but with a clear understanding, he will not deal with the drug market anymore. One middle of the way underling will serve a moderate amount of time for several murders, and the others will serve moderate time for drug dealing. [...]",0,-999,-999,-999,-999,-999,-999
The Wire,"This is a review of all five seasons, a total of 60 episodes. This is not a series for the squeamish, and many sensitive people could not sit through more than five minutes of it. It is ultra-realistic as a study of the struggle between the police and the criminal black drug-dealing underclass in Baltimore, Maryland, USA. About 50% of the dialogue consists of expletives, and barely a sentence is spoken in 60 hours which does not include 'st', 'fk', 'mother f..g', 'd..k', 'c..k sucker', and so on. Few of the characters seem to have any other mode of expression. The impoverishment of language on the police side is, however, slightly compensated by the bizarre patois of the street, which, constructed as it is of strings of offensive expletives, nevertheless contains countless priceless linguistic gems and apothegms, and intriguing twists of language such as 'True, that', 'No man, I be cool', and colourful characters like Omar who say things like: 'Omar cool', always dropping his verbs. All of the acting in this series is outstandingly brilliant, but the two performances which stand out above all the rest are by Andre Royo and Michael Kenneth Williams. Both create characters as fully-rounded and memorable as any found in Charles Dickens. Royo plays the endearing but hopelessly pathetic Bubbles, a street character who is a heroin addict and a police snitch. He often tries to get off drugs ('I be clean, I be clean') but continually relapses. He is soft-hearted, always struggling to be a better person and to help some young lad he likes, is frequently beaten up by thugs, never gives up, and finally succeeds in straightening himself out and regaining his self-respect. Williams plays the semi-villain Omar Little. He has a strict code of honour: he only kills and robs drug dealers, 'an' don't never do nuthin against no citizen'. Williams has the most amazingly ink-black skin and unusual face, and for anyone who knows about African tribes, it seems plain that he is descended from the Akan of Ghana, and probably from a line of chiefs. Omar has so many endearing qualities, and considering he only kills drug dealers, that we forgive him everything. We even become fond of his sawn-off shotgun because it inevitably means that some horrible villain is going to get what he deserves. There are so many remarkable characters in the series that it is impossible to do them justice. One can never forget the lesbian policewoman Shakima, played by Sonja Sohn. And Lance Reddick as the police officer Daniels is unforgettable also, as indeed he was to become again in the science fiction series of 88 episodes, FRINGE (2008, see my review). In Season Four, this series shifts heavily into the corrupt city politics of Baltimore, expanding its scope and becoming even more interesting. It then becomes a bit like the Danish series THE KILLING (2007, see my review). Season Two explores the corrupt world of the Baltimore longshoremens' union and the docks crisis, where the port is becoming defunct and Russian prostitutes are being shipped in in sea containers. It is all very seamy, but alas, all these things are happening, so perhaps we ought to know something about them. It is Seasons Three to Five which really take off. Although not as strongly plot-driven in the detective sense as the first two seasons, and being far more complex and rambling, they weave such a rich and fascinating tapestry of 'human interest' that the drama rises to an extremely high level of intensity. Several of the serious rogues in the series are so well portrayed that they become powerful human presences. You might call it the fascination of true evil, like watching cobras in a nest. Proposition Joe, a thoughtful and extremely fat drug lord, has the endearing hobby of tinkering with broken clocks in a small shop. A girl drug dealer who is about to be shot asks, as her last words: 'How is my hair?' Stringer Bell, another murderous drug lord, is an earnest student of business studies at a university when he is not organising horrible and ruthless crimes. Avon Barksdale, another ruthless murderer and drug lord, has an abstracted, almost whimsical quality about him. People are murdered suddenly by being shot in the head, throughout the series. You never know who is going to get killed next, from one scene to another. But the gruesomeness is not dwelled upon by the camera, and mostly the victims just fall over. Character after character, all of them slowly built up as interesting, suddenly vanishes from the action. One main character is shot unexpectedly by a ten year-old boy when he stops to buy cigarettes. The main theme of the series seems to be the relentless and unending succession of sudden and unexpected deaths in the jungle of Baltimore's low-life. In one pathetic scene, a young black boy caught up in drug dealing, asks an older man who is trying to persuade him to give it up and live a clean life somewhere else: 'How do you get from here to the rest of the world?' We see that everyone in the series is trapped, whether in the police force, in politics, in local journalism on the failing Baltimore Sun newspaper, or in drug dealing. And worst of all, they are all trapped in Baltimore, which is portrayed as an unremitting hell hole, from which, like a black hole in outer space, nothing, not even a flash of light, can escape. But the series is so vivid, so alive, so brilliantly made, that as viewers we do not mind being trapped in Baltimore, and keep watching episode after episode compulsively. The quality of the acting is incredibly high all round. And several episodes were directed, surprisingly, by Agnieszka Holland, one of the finest feature film directors there is these days.",1,1,1,1,0,1,0
The Wire,"My wife gave me the complete series as a Christmas gift and although the television series is more than a decade old now I do not feel it has lost any of its relevancy regarding crime and human nature over this past decade or two.There are a total of 60 episodes spread out over five seasons and there are just too many great performances and excellent story lines to mention them all. Suffice to say that the two main characters are two Baltimore city detectives. Jimmy McNulty (played by Dominic West) is a white Irish rebellious detective who will screw anyone to get to the criminal he is chasing. Along the way he hurts a lot of his fellow cops, his bosses and lets down his immediate family time and time again. With all his faults though once he gives you that great Irish grin of his all is forgiven, no matter what the circumstances.McNulty's partner is Detective William Moreland, better known around the station house and the bars simply as ""Bunk"" who knows McNulty best. Bunk is a heavy set well dressed black cop (played by Wendell Pierce) who likes to chomp on a cigar and drink hard liquor to extremes. Bunk has a lot of life in him, and is considered a cops impression of what a real detective should be. A hard drinking, womanizing, persistent cop who really wants to get the worst criminal elements behind bars serving hard time. Both Bunk and McNulty have ex-wives and two children but their lives really evolve around the city of Baltimore's urban city corners where drugs are always readily available, and murders are popping up within the walls behind condemned row houses by the dozens. The other two characters who deserve special mention are the drug lords, Avon Barksdale (played by Wood Harris) and Russell ""Stringer"" Bell (played by Idris Elba). Now these two gangsta's grew up on the city streets of Baltimore like many other city hoods but the difference is they had both street smarts and the will to kill anyone who got in their way. Theirs are interesting story lines throughout the series and keep the audience guessing what they will do next. No spoiler alert so I will defer from giving away too much on their path to destruction.Two characters who you can't help but feel compassion for due to their diverse journeys throughout the series are the drug addicted junk man Reginald ""Bubbles"" Cousins played to perfection by Andre Royo, and the shotgun wielding gay drug thief Omar Little, also played with fearless perfection by Michael Kenneth Williams. Now their lives when involved in any scene are never predictable and you cannot help but root for them to win. Hell, even the cops cut them a lot of slack as they can see that their hearts are big, but their minds are twisted after living on the streets their entire lives.I could go on and provide details on at least another dozen strong performances by other cops, attorneys, judges, police captains, shipyard workers, and even kids, but I suggest instead that you keep this crime themed television series on your ""must watch"" list and if you ever want to see a series that captivates the drug crime world of a major urban city such as in this Baltimore story you won't be able to stop watching until you watch at least a couple more episodes before you go to bed far too late in to the early morning hours because it is just that good a dramatic crime series. And isn't that really when the crime comes out? Late at night?I give it a perfect 10 out of 10 and a MUST SEE for a television crime and dramatic series.",1,1,1,0,0,1,0
The Wire,"It took time and energy to grasp this series in full, but for better clarity and smoothness, I decided to watch them in chronological sequence. It was a right thing, as many later events and motives had their roots in prior actions reflected in prior series.Drug trafficking has become a serious issue in the Western world, but often its use is depicted as a glamorous party component, elevating your mood and abilities. The real world for most is totally different, full of misery and danger, what is well seen in The Wire, where even those committed to do something about it, in spite of their job or background, run up against lack of several things: will, money, opportunities, rights... Desperate times call for desperate measures, but you never know how all it will end, and usually there is no ending, just a temporary relief or standstill. Thus, all the series is harshly realistic: there is no general win, drug business has not vanished, but one could call it a victory when someone (particularly a young person) finds his or her way out of this often vicious circle.Its broad ensemble cast is evenly strong, there are no (at that time) internationally famous persons stealing the show and requiring additional fee... Every character had its meaning and place, but, in some series, Detective Jimmy McNulty (Dominic West) was too limited time on screen, plus I often mixed up younger Black drug dealers - their nickname, faces, and gang affiliation. But all in all, they were all enjoyable to follow, as there were very few fully good or bad types - even many of those dealing of killing daily felt compassion in some other spheres, and the police included many rather dubious persons.Thus, a recommended series, although I understand them who claim that it provides an inclined and questionable overview of Baltimore - ""decent"" neighborhoods were almost not shown. Well, but big cities are full of ghettos and seclusion, and the target audience was hardly meant to be all-inclusive tourists.",1,1,0,0,0,1,0
The Wire,"In the beginning,David Simon was a writer for the Baltimore Sun. Teaming up with Ed Burns who used to be on the police force, Simon developed a handful of characters based on stories and people he wrote about. Together he and Burns designed what is perhaps the smartest piece of television in history along side the SimpsonsThe Wire is all about the drug wars going on in the roughest part of Baltimore, and what goes down on either side of the law. What makes the show so special is the way it is presented in an objective unbiased way. When the media or network drama show crime in the world, the material is always dumbed down or dichotomized, meaning broken down into a two sided issue (good vs. bad). The Wire does not do this, it shows the big picture. For example, there are frequent times when some of the criminals are likable, and the cops are not. There are no easy heroes, or villains, there are no clichés or gimmicks, and there is no illusion to what we see. It is real. In season one, a mismatched handful of police officers from two departments (homicide and major crimes) are brought together to become a special unit with one objective. They are to monitor the drug criminals using a wiretap until they have enough evidence to bring down the operation. It is harder than it sounds, way harder. The smartest of these cops is Detective James McNulty, an eager, sharp-thinking cop, who leads a wreck of a life, (part of which has to do which his drinking problem). His team is also dedicated and hard working, but in the police department, the chain of command makes it hard for them to do their job. Sitting in the big chairs are people who are more interested in their jobs and good publicity rather than running expensive slow operations like wiretapping drug drug lords, which doesn't result in frequent arrests.On the other side of the law, the head honchos are ruffians who are only interested in business, but the pawns in that game (the ones who sell the drugs on street corners) are in a very disturbing and sympathetic situation. A lot of them are just kid, youngsters who say no to an education. Some of the ones we meet are only grade school aged! They do drug dealing to make money which barely keeps them surviving in the harsh world they live in.The complexity and grittiness and anger of the show has resulted in a lack of commercial success, but anyone who likes good television, will not only love The Wire, they will praise it.

The Wire,"My Rating : 8/10If you want fancy storylines, plot twists, cliffhangers, big-budget blockbuster-level shows there's Game of Thrones, Breaking Bad and Mad Men which will ample please you.

It's about how our society is flawed and a complete failure to the poor and minorities.This may be too slow and boring for some (I found S2 and S5 really slow and I believe younger viewers will find the technology outdated) and I indeed didn't enjoy it very much but it's not something to be enjoyed per se.

The Wire,"Some years ago, 'The Wire' was on repeat via 13th Street, but unfortunately I missed the first season. Recently I have watched this again, this time the whole shebang. Though a second run is never quite the same (read: as fresh as the first run), it was still a pleasure of the seldom kind.Season 1 turned out to be (of course) quite important in laying out some groundwork for the later seasons, but it's not my favorite. 'The criminals' and 'the cops' are the two main groups that return in every season and then there are a few groups that appear for only one or two seasons; for instance, one of my favorites is the harbor gang, which only appears in the second season (except for a few very, very short bits later on). All these 'gangs' make it that the show seems to wander at times, but it all concerns the city of Baltimore and its confrontations with, mainly, drug-related crime. And even though there are my favorite groups in this, there is nothing in it that I really didn't like. The least of it all would be Carcetti and his gang and some of that political stuff going on, but I can't deny it's all crucial to the story.One of the biggest strongpoints of 'The Wire' is its cast; a great bunch of actors who inhabit the screen with fierce charisma. And in mentioning Bubbles, Omar, Bunk, Cutty, Rhonda, Frank, Bodie or Herc separately, I'm only addressing the fact that one will have his or her favorites - I might as well have copy-pasted the whole list of characters.The story of a city. The city of Baltimore. Okay, not every side gets the spotlights, as for instance it could have been interesting to have a hospital setting in this, but you can't have it all. And though the story is not told in the usual way, like 'good guys vs. bad guys' or something, there is a lot of (sincere) sentiment in it and certainly 'The Wire' shows a big ol' soft spot for its characters (and Baltimore) at times... but does not refrain from being ruthless as life itself will be as well.A wonderful show that deserves watching, and I'm pretty sure I will watch it again to discover and understand even more about the characters, their motives and how everything ties together. 9 out of 10.",1,1,1,0,0,1,0
The Wire,"The first time I heard of ""The Wire"" was on some forum discussing TV shows. After checking out some clips on Youtube I wasn't all that impressed. With nothing left to watch I decided to give it a go. And I must admit that this show is very rewarding on many different aspects even if it can be relentless and it doesn't hold back one bit. Don't expect any mercy from this show. And I mean none since most of what you see happening to these people on the screen is true to life (at least the core of it). You will learn to appreciate the characters even if they aren't really likable. And here lies the strength of the show. There is a wonderful story present but is not something you haven't seen before. The attention to detail however is. This show has a depth that is not present in other crime dramas. ""The Wire"" shows all the sides and aspects involved in (mainly) drug trafficking. We will follow the police,the criminals,the politicians and the victims of the drug trade. While the overall tone of the show is meant to be serious and educational,it doesn't mean that there is no room for entertainment. I can't remember another serious crime drama where I laughed so hard as I did with this show. ""The Wire"" is filled with the most funniest scenes you will ever see. And considering the context you will not see these jokes coming. It has been a while now that I have seen this show and I still think about it.

The Wire,"The Wire delivers over and over again in this remarkable television series that will serve as the bench mark for what television can be.The city of Baltimore, along with an enormous cast of virtual unknowns, star prominently in a story, spread over 5 years, of the breaking down of America.

Cases are built, plots are laid like threads over the show's length and it all culminates in unexpected ways. Criminals are heroes, Cops are criminals. There is no black and white.

The Wire,"The wire is more of a social commentary rather than an entertaining TV series. It was groundbreaking in its day because of the many themes it tackled. The show was not one targeted to audiences but seemed to be more about the writers sharing their own experiences and then turning that into a narrative that they felt had to be told. The pace is slow moving, the cast a mixture of talents (and very fake accents that were sometimes annoying), and the plot at times, tedious to get through. The nature of the series meant it is one that people would tire of after a while since the experience was that of the writers, not really something an average audience would find interesting. By the third season, it starts to go downhill, and it appears to have been hurriedly cancelled in the fifth season as the race to tie up loose ends is very apparent i.e characters had to be killed off or brought to justice quickly!Overall, it's worth a watch but the audience should not think the series is about audience entertainment, or that they are the focus of the series. That is the secondary focus. It's more like an academic course in socio-anthropology with acting! This is what makes the show not one for general consumption as it does appear to be somewhat of an ego trip (or maybe a catharsis) for the creators/writers.",0,0,0,-999,-999,-999,-999
The Wire,"Set in Baltimore, with story lines of crime and law intertwined with each other. The show mainly follows Jimmy McNulty (West) and his fellow detectives and superiors; as well as street level drug dealers of the Barksdale Organization, led by Avon Barksdale (Harris). Corruption becomes a subplot and seasonal theme including: the city port (Season 2), the political scene (Season 3), the school system (Season 4) and the media (Season 5). Praised for its realism, which includes some slow spots as well as the killing off of its most well-developed characters at random points in the series. While things slow down and speed up at many points of the series, there ceases to be anything remotely uninteresting.

The Wire,"The Wire is quite different from anything else you will see on TV. Usually when films are presented in foreign languages there is either dubbing or subtitles. This has neither. The criminal street dialect that pervades the shows is almost as incomprehensible as Russian. You recognise some familiar swear words, but you soon learn that ""shit"" has several hundred different meanings depending on context. Lots of words are familiar, but used in ways you have never heard before. A word like ""do"" could translate to almost any verb in an English dictionary. I find this quite frustrating. So much strange ""shit"" happens that I cannot understand at all or why anyone is doing it. The police too have complicated, but easier to decode jargon.Further the characters, both police and criminals have a sense of what is appropriate behaviour totally different from mine. Their motivations make even less sense that those of hippopotami. Sometimes the actors discuss why they did various things. This rarely makes any sense at all to me. People are intensely and imaginatively cruel to each other, seemingly just for something to do. Watching too many episodes in a row can be depressing.At the same time, the alien world this series presents is so different from anything I have experienced in my own life, or on film, that it is quite fascinating, even if repulsive. It is a huge puzzle to be solved. It is inspired by the same spirit of Fellini's Satyricon, or science fiction, creating an alien world.I am gay, and most TV entertainment is filled with handsome young males whose bones I would love to jump. The actors here are in general utterly repulsive, even when they have fine bodies. Many are grossly obese. The makeup people deliberately modify each handsome young actor in some quirky way to creep me out or perhaps they just find them that way.",0,-1,0,-999,-999,-999,-999
Palm Springs,"IMDB lists this film as a comedy romance. Well, I can see the romance part but a comedy? No. In fact, the film, despite starring Andy Samberg, is certainly NOT a comedy nor is it funny....and I really don't think it was intended to be.The film is a reworking of the basic concept in ""Groundhog Day""...a guy (Samberg) keeps repeating the same day again and again and again. The big differences are that others CAN get stuck in this same time loop as him and it's just not funny nor sweet like ""Groundhog Day"". In fact, although most reviews are very, very favorable and it has an overall score of 7.5, I didn't enjoy it very much. Part of it was that I never liked the characters and part of it was that the film, at times, was dark and bleak...and unnecessarily crude. Overall, a film many like...but I felt underwhelmed.",-1,-999,-999,-999,-999,-999,-999
Palm Springs,"Or is it? Sometimes you can't tell. Also while this is reminiscent of a Bill Murray classic, it does not contain the moral lesson. At least it is not meant to be taken that way. Doesn't mean there is not good things happening and characters developing. It just not as attached to the story or rather resolution as the Murray movie was.Having said that, this also is more in the R-rated territory. So while it has some nice moments, it also isn't afraid of pulling punches. This is really funny and the two leads give it their all. Even JK Simmons who's barely in it, is as grounded (no pun intended) as he always is. But it is about the chemistry of the two lead actors and it really translates more than well.

Palm Springs,"For a film that rips its premise off the ultimate time loop movie, ""Groundhog Day,"" ""Palm Springs"" is surprisingly unpredictable and exceedingly charming. It's got an anarchic anything goes vibe and a pair of vibrant actors, Andy Samberg and Cristin Milioti, who also happen to have a ton of chemistry together. It's a movie for our very troubled times and seems tailor made for a quarantined audience, where day bleeds into day and the repetition of the weekly grind is sending many of us to the loony bin. The sweet message at the center of this otherwise naughty film is that it's not the what we do that keeps us happy but rather the who we do it with. It's all about appreciating the little things that make life worth living moment to moment rather than focusing all of our energies on the big things that we chase at the risk of letting peace and contentment pass us right on by.This message is most effectively encapsulated in the character played by J.K. Simmons, who spends the first half of the movie trying to kill Andy Samberg and then has a great scene toward the end that makes the most mundane situation imaginable seem like a little piece of heaven.

Palm Springs,"You could compare Palm Springs with Groundhog Day (1993), this version is just a modern take of that classic movie but it's certainly as funny if not funnier. I liked both of the movies but I prefer Andy Samberg to Bill Murray. Bill Murray was more of a grumpy unsastified character whilst Andy Samberg has a more laidback-not-giving-a-toss character. It's not completely the same story though. Palm Springs has a lot of good humorous scenes, and Andy Sambergs usual funny face and expressions are contributing to that. Since Brooklyn Nine-Nine I'm a fan of Andy Samberg, he has everything to become the new star comedian. And even if his previous movie Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping didn't leave me with a great impression this one is certainly a step forward. Palm Springs is for the fans of silly comedies, with a touch of romance, but it's not the typical romcom as for that the plot is also interesting to watch. There are elements that make it intriguing, things you have to think about. A comedy that I will for sure watch again in the future.",1,1,1,0,0,1,0

Palm Springs,"As I've said in previous reviews and for many years, the modern day rom-com is nearly dead. There are outliers a few times a year typically but the formula was incredibly overdone back in the 1990's-2000's, that I think we began to grow numb of what a great rom-com can actually be. Palm Springs is a GREAT rom-com and it's also one of the best films of 2020, if not the best. Not to mention how perfect it is for the summer season and current quarantine most of the world is stuck in. What better than a rom-com about two characters stuck in a time-loop of never ending death at the end of their day?

Palm Springs,"Palm Springs' directed by Max Barbakow (incredibly at his first feature film) is for me the good surprise of the end of this strange cinematic year 2020. It is also a film that proves once again, if necessary, to skeptics and cynics that there are entertainment films and romantic comedies that do not insult the intelligence of viewers, and that 'feel good' movies can contain a dose of fantastic (and even references to quantum mechanics). The premiere of 'Palm Springs' took place at the Sundance Film Festival, after which the movie was supposed to be screened in theaters, but then the world froze and same as many other productions Barbakow's film had to find a streaming platform as its main broadcast channel. I'm so sorry for their missed opportunity, because this funny movie would have had good chances to be the big surprise and maybe even one of the blockbusters of the summer of 2020. Unfortunately, COVID-19 had other plans.The film begins with the awakening of Nyles (Andy Samberg), on a sunny morning in a resort in the middle of the desert, where he accompanies his (not very committed) girlfriend to the wedding where she is the bridesmaid. Nyles, a rather non-conformist guy, almost ruins the party with an impromptu speech influenced by intense drinking at the bar, and later in the nighr he he meets Sarah (Cristin Milioti), the bride's sister and the family's 'black sheep'. The two seem to have a 'click' that will take them to the desert at night where the beginning of a sexual encounter is interrupted by an event ... and here I stop telling more about the story so as to avoid falling into the sin of spoiling.What happens next is a combination of crazy and romantic, fantasy and clever comedy. Many comments on the film mention that the inspiration comes from 'Groundhog Day', a film I have not seen. What I can say is that I did not find any logical flaw in the script written by Andy Siara, who manages to give credibility to the pretext and substance of the characters, makes us viewers care about them, and even adds a touch of science with which the heroes will come out from a complicated situation. I didn't know the two lead actors or I don't remember them from other movies, but they both manage to win our empathy. J.K. Simmons, an actor we know from countless television series, is distributed here in a very different and original role. 'Palm Springs' is one of the best entertainments of the year, a kind and smart movie that I warmly recommend. It's fun.",1,1,1,1,0,1,0
Palm Springs,"Cheerful, charming & compelling throughout, Palm Springs brings the Groundhog Day formula to its romantic comedy premise and adds a few tweaks that only end up providing some welcome upgrades to the time loop subgenre. The film doesn't bother itself with what's causing the time reset and simply takes the idea and runs with it.Directed by Max Barbakow, the film is crafted with so much heart, verve & passion that it has no trouble whatsoever in bringing the audience into its repetitive world and make them navigate it with our protagonists. What also makes the ride such a fun, breezy & captivating delight are the wonderfully scripted characters and their witty interactions & evolving relationships.Each reset allows the characters to play with the possibilities and it is amusing to watch no doubt but it is in the intimate moments shared by them where the film finds its finest highlights. At the end of the day, none of it would've mattered if it wasn't for Andy Samberg & Cristin Milioti who are excellent individually but even better when together, for the chemistry they share is both heartfelt & infectious.Overall, Palm Springs is a hilarious & heartwarming romantic comedy that brims with life and expertly balances its genre elements to provide a refreshing delight that's gripping from the get-go and remains an enjoyable & entertaining fare for the entirety of its runtime. Steered by Andy Siara's flavourful script & Barbakow's energetic direction and bolstered by Samberg & Milioti's spot-on chemistry, Palm Springs is one of the best films of the year.",1,1,1,1,0,1,0

Palm Springs,"There's something about time loop movies that are pretty cool, though I guess it probably has to do with Groundhog Day simply being one of those classic films that spur people on to adapt it to different situations. This one is certainly no different, and it does have some uniqueness about it that I particularly enjoyed. The difference with this one is that multiple people are actually trapped in the time loop, and they are able to interact with each other, which I thought was quite cool. The other thing is that while we know who is trapped in the loop, we don't know how long they have been in the loop, namely because they have been caught in it for so long.So, basically have this guy Nyles, who as you can guess, has been living this day over and over again. Like, it's a wedding where his girlfriend is a bridesmaid, and it is located out in the desert, Palms Springs to be precise. Obviously, he has used the opportunity to, well, pretty much try everything, and he also discovers and awful lot of secrets as well, such as his girlfriend being unfaithful to him. However, the catch comes when one night he is out in the desert with the maid of honour, and is attacked, and he flees into the cave, the one that originally started the time loop, and she follows him in.It's pretty cool actually, and while I'd suggest that it is slightly different to Groundhog Day, it still has a lot of the elements. It's pretty funny as well, especially with a lot of the shennanigans that he gets up to. In fact, it seems as if he has been in this loop for so long that he no longer cares, and it has just become part of his life. Not so with Sarah, who is looking for a way out, and decides that the only way to do it is through quantum physics. Actually, it's quite interesting how these days quantum physics is thrown around with the idea of time loops, but that is probably because despite having been around for about a hundred years, there is still a lot we really don't know about it. In fact, it is just another one of those 'new frontier' type of things film makers and such that is probably why it appears so often.Anyway, this is a pretty cool film, and quite funny as well. While it doesn't really break new ground, it's stull quite fun to watch.",0,-999,-999,-999,-999,-999,-999
Palm Springs,"It's like I said, I love ""Groundhog Day"" (1993). I've seen it over a hundred times.... But, I enjoy time-travel movies in general, including the time-loop variety in the vein of that Bill Murray-Harold Ramis classic, such as ""Edge of Tomorrow"" (2014) and Netflix's ""Russian Doll"" series. Time travel is an inherently cinematic notion, of an art form that literally consists of moments in time--still images, shots and scenes--along a continuum--what used to be the film strip--that may be edited, rearranged and begun again, reviewed by the spectator ad infinitum. The main difference of ""Palm Springs,"" although it's partially a continuation of a thread from ""Russian Doll,"" is that it places multiple characters in the time loop instead of just the usual lone (and usually male) protagonist--to wake up in the same place on the same day every day, always at a wedding in Palm Springs. Thus, there are shifts in perspective running concurrent with the temporal repetition of events and place. Besides offering a greater gender balance to the rom-com formula, this opens up an array of possibilities in montage and storytelling.In this case, the bifurcated narrative is largely exploited for efficiency. I'd be fine lingering in such a scenario, a sense Murray gives us in ""Groundhog Day,"" with his various schemes and explorations of his situation. It's a fantasy that's well suited to the episodic format of ""Russian Doll."" Unlike these prior efforts, however, ""Palm Springs"" rushes through and is able to do so because Andy Samberg's Nyles has been living this repeated plot for long before we caught up with him in the movie, and so he is able to quickly get Cristin Milioti's Sarah up to speed when she joins him in the repetition. Interestingly, the idea of beginning the picture with the male character having already re-lived the same day untold times was a feature of Danny Rubin's original screenplay for ""Groundhog Day,"" but Ramis altered this rather arthouse notion to an easier and more commercially-friendly beginning where we enter the time loop at the same moment with Murray. ""Palm Springs"" is able to have it both ways.Neither does ""Palm Spring"" afford much space to philosophical or religious musings. Indeed, Nyles declares on the first night we meet him that there's no god. Even the supposed quantum physics within the picture doesn't rise above the sophistication of an installment from the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Ultimately, ""Palm Springs"" is merely a place we're meant to inhabit fleetingly, for some laughs and the cliché love story conquering all. Some critics are surely tempted to analogize this version with the unraveling of habit and structure making days seemingly run into each other--losing track of time--for many in the real world of 2020 by isolating themselves or otherwise limiting their activities due to the pandemic, but the timing here is as accidental as that for the characters within the movie. No, ""Palm Springs"" is a lovely fantasy, where death is a reset button and where one feels more freedom than ever without the threat of tomorrow, as well as to experience it safely with others. There's no meaning underlying this romp beyond the hackneyed wholesomeness of family life provided by J.K. Simmons's Roy and romantic coupling that's the foundation of the entire premise. That's fine; fun need not always be wrapped in layers of existential profundity--a ""shaggy dog"" story will do. Some days are well enough by just enjoying the slight variations to the same format. I'll see ""Palm Springs"" again.",1,0,1,0,0,0,0

Palm Springs,"Once you've seen one time loop movie, in many ways you have seen them all but this years Sundance Film Festival hit Palm Springs, where the film was bought by streaming service Hulu for a mind-blowing 17,500 000 (a Sundance record), is an extremely enjoyable ride that makes a star out of its co-star Cristin Milioti in the process.Directed by debut feature film director Max Barbakow, Springs is a sun-soaked romantic comedy with a sci-fi/time loop twist as Andy Samberg's long-suffering and carefree Nyles finds himself living out a particular day in Palm Springs over and over, an experience that leads him to find solace in drink, the threat of being hunted by J.K Simmons jaded fellow loop sufferer Roy and most importantly the friendship he strikes up with Milioti's newly looped Sarah.There's lots of instances where Springs feels familiar and lots of beats it plays out that are to be expected from such an affair but Barbakow (working off a great script by Andy Siara) and his two lead performers inject a hearty dosage of soul and charm into much of the films elements ensuring that we as an audience are constantly given laughs and even in many ways emotionally resonate feelings as Nyles and Sarah's relationships grows.In what's by far his best lead turn in anything outside of the likes of the great but low-brow Lonely Island backed Hot Rod and Popstar and his work in TV hit Brooklyn 99, Samberg shows there is more to the man than objects in boxes and pants mishaps as he brings Nyles to life.The real joy however is his interplay with Milioti who shines as the flawed but affable Sarah.A long serving performer in TV and movie parts, Milioti is a revelation as Sarah. She shares great comedic timing with Samberg and as the two begin to explore their repetitive new lives and decide to live it up, the film really hits a strong groove that while culminating in a little bit of a so-so final stretch, is extremely entertaining while it lasts in the films particularly memorable middle section.There's no doubt that we will be seeing a lot of Milioti from now on in, with Hollywood sure to be knocking down her door.Final Say -It doesn't reinvent the time loop wheel and has moments where it coasts along but Palm Springs is a mightily enjoyable ride when everything clicks and will work wonders for the futures of its two on fire lead performers.3 1/2 dinosaurs out of 5",1,1,0,1,0,1,0

Palm Springs,"The 'Groundhog Day' scenario is starting to be used in films more and more I've noticed. 'Happy Death Day' took a crack at - and it went extremely well. 'Before I Fall' also used it - with slightly less successful results. And now 'Palm Springs' has used it. Ironically the only one of those films I haven't seen is 'Groundhog Day'. I absolutely loved 'Palm Springs'. The concept worked perfectly here, and they worked the concept perfectly. It was funny, touching, thought-provoking and inventive. It never felt like it was stepping on anyone's toes either. It just worked.The cast are a big part of what made this so great. Andy Samberg for starters nailed the lead role. He was endlessly likeable, relatable and hilarious (without turning it into a full-blown comedy). It's hard to imagine many actors playing this role as well as he did. Also Cristin Milioti deserves almost an equal amount of credit. She had to make us fall in love with her (despite being quite a flawed character in a lot of ways) so that we would buy Samberg's character falling for her. And she pulled it off and then some. Finally, J.K. Simmons was a great addition to the film. He actually isn't given a whole lot to do, but what he is given to work with he utilises extremely well.I love that the film made you question yourself over whether the scenario would be good to have happen to you or not. Personally, I would absolutely love every minute of it. I could live the same day over and over for 1000 years quite happily. But I understand why a lot of people wouldn't like that too.

It's a film that had big boots to fill but the good news is that it's a complete success and every bit as enjoyable as its predecessor. At three hours I wasn't sure about the pacing, but even during the slower first half the viewer's interest remains piqued thanks to the witty dialogue and huge cast of well-established characters doing their thing.The time travel plot might seem a cop out to some, but I really enjoyed the way it gives characters a chance to revisit earlier productions (and even allow the likes of Robert Redford to show up in clever cameos). The climactic action is well worth the wait and bests the battles in LORD OF THE RINGS: RETURN OF THE KING in terms of pure CGI spectacle; it only took them 16 years to get it right.

Avengers: Endgame,"Hawkeye loses his family with the snap. Tony Stark and Nebula are stranded in space. They are rescued by Captain Marvel. What remains of the Avengers set off to confront Thanos only to find that he had already destroyed the Stones. Five years later, Scott Lang escapes from the quantum realm. He is shocked by the new world order and comes up with an idea to save everyone, a Time Heist.This is the 22nd film in the MCU. The best aspect is that it pulls together the whole series of movies and fulfill many of their emotional storylines. Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, Black Widow, Hawkeye, Ant-Man, and Nebula all get some powerful personal stories. Thor is doing a funny ""The Dude"" Lebowski. Iron Man is his family. Captain America finally gets his love. Hawkeye becomes vengeance. There are some other aspects that I would alter with the Infinity Gauntlet.For Ant-Man, Paul Rudd's comedic takes diminishes his pain from losing Hope. He's not quite as broken as Hawkeye. His lost keeps conflicting with his humor. Black Widow's fight with Hawkeye lasts too long. Sometimes, less is more and doing fewer reversals would add power to each turn. Nebula's final confrontation with herself needs some better work. She needs to have a talk with herself or do an Indiana Jones and shot right away. She could give a punchline like ""I don't like how she looks"". The movie yadayada a lot about time travel. The only explanation is that it's not any of those movies. It's a funny line but it's basically saying that it has no rules. Then the characters say that there are rules. I don't begrudge the MCU for yadayadaing the rules because that could get real complicate. Finally, this MCU ends like many MCU movies, with a chaotic massive final battle. I'd prefer cutting that back and the female Avengers assemble is a little too convenient. Just have two other women. That's enough. It becomes fan service. Overall, the emotional resolutions are great. The recalls to the other movies are satisfying. The story works for the most part.

Avengers: Endgame,"""Avengers: Endgame"" is a new American movie from 2019 and well do I really need to say a lot about the basics here? Maybe only a little bit as absolutely everybody should know by now who the Avengers are. I believe it is essential that you have seen the previous Avengers movie from 2018 in order to appreciate this one here. But you don't need to have seen everything before that from the Avengers universe by any means in order to understand this one here. Directors Russo and Russo are back and they also got their screen writers on board again here, but this is really not a surprise and accurate as this is basically a duology. Also despite the ending from the previous Avengers film, all the actors are back and with that I really do mean ""all"", even some that did not show up in the last Avengers movie, but in previous films from the universe. Michael Douglas and Michelle Pfeiffer would be the best example, even if all of these really only have very brief screen time. And what was with that Robert Redford inclusion? Now that did feel a bit bizarre. Anyway, in this 3-hour(!) film the remaining Avengers are faced with the big challenge to find a way to turn things right again and when the option of time travel arises, this seems to be their only chance. Sadly, Thanos, the titan and main antagonist, who managed to erase half the universe in the previous film, finds out about the remaining Avengers' plans. It will be a tough battle. But one when there are new heroes on the horizon offering hope such as Captain Marvel Carol Danvers who just got her own movie not too long ago. That one featured a great deal of Samuel L. Jackson, who is almost unseen in this one here. But I mentioned Thanos already and would like to say a few more words about him now. I really loved him in the 2018 film, but in this one here, he was a bit underwhelming. I understand he is weakened because he destroyed the stones not too long ago and also does not really care too much because his mission is complete, but still the way we see him basically fight all Avengers at the very same time in the previous movie and here Captain Marvel alone can almost keep him under control at his neck. Or Thor out of nowhere severes his head. It just felt a bit too easy for me honestly. Now that I mentioned Thor here, he is in it pretty much for the comedy only this time as he has turned into quite a bum over the years when everybody is clueless how to bring the lost souls and friends back. And there are many other comedy-themed moments in here. You will laugh, but you will also be sad on some occasions. I will go into further detail about that statement in the next paragraph, so if you want to avoid in-depth spoilers, then now is the time to stop reading.I personally was more shocked by the death of Black Widow than by the death of Iron Man, perhaps because I have never been a huge RDJ fan in this franchise, even if I don't mind him either. And well, Scar-Jo plays in some films I quite adore, so it was sad to see her go, also because the build-up was very strong and you never knew if it was her or Jeremy Renner's character who would die. I like him too, so a loss-loss for me. Oh well I read Black Widow will get her own film soon, so I am curious how that turns out. 100% I'm gonna watch it. And at the end, when we find out about Captain America's personal decision how to spend the rest of his life, it was a bit sad and touching too, even if I think I read that Evans is finished with the franchise after this film. We'll see how his replacement does. I have a bit of a feeling by now they are really trying too hard to get African American actors in here for the sake of it. But maybe he can prove me wrong and he is actually good. Another scene I did not like very much was the female-power-centered one when we see virtually all female characters line up all of a sudden. That did feel cringeworthy and just for the sake of pleasing liberal Hollywood. But yeah, there were many really good moments that quickly make me forget about these, so it is all good. There were great moments without a doubt and I think the Avengers universe keeps going in style. But you should not expect this film to be as good as the last. I think it stays lower quality-wise. Stan Lee's final brief cameo was also rather underwhelming. May he rest in peace. Okay finally, the closing credits were kinda special this time because we also see the protagonists in a unique way and do not get the usual epilogue scene with indications to the next movie, but it makes sense as of course there is definite closure in this movie here and the Russos most likely won't return or if they will, they have no ideas yet what will come up next. It must be special to top Thanos and these two films for sure though. But yeah, the universe is restored, half of the civilization erased is back and Thanos is defeated, so time to take a breath for a little while. And pay attention to how it is those who survived the cleansing (Black Widow, Iron Man and Captain America) who are eventually those who can be called fallen, well CA only to some extent. I think it is not necessary to give you a recommendation here as you probably know very well how much you like superhero films. The one thing I think is essential though is that you must absolutely watch the 2018 film before seeing this one and then you can decide for yourself if you want to sit through another 3 hours on the subject or accept evil being victorious. Make the right choice for yourself. I give Avengers: Endgame a thumbs-up, but not a too enthusiastic one as before.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Avengers: Endgame,"Much like I did for Infinity War, I was caught up a little bit on the hype, but mostly I think I prioritized seeing this so that I could browse Reddit again, since so many popular posts are memes from the final two Avengers films. Unsurprisingly perhaps, I found that it was very much the overall picture I found with Infinity War, which is that it is far from perfect, a blockbuster pure and simple, but that it is quite a piece of work in terms of how well put together it all is.In terms of that structure, at time of writing this there are quite a few comments comparing it to the final season of Game of Thrones (which right now just has 2 episodes left) in the way that it has to bring everything together. The comparison is unfavorable, partly because GoT continues it very rushed approach to writing, but mainly because Endgame does it very well. The detail of the plotting is of course filled with holes that are best just to ignore, but the structure allows for a very nice conclusion as we retouch on moments from within the existing films, allowing nostalgia, references, and a sense of winding it up (although of course it will continue as long as the films make money). As with Infinity War, the writing somehow gives characters enough time despite there being so many of them; it hits several tones but none undercuts or takes away from another; and it mixes humor and action into a plot that takes itself seriously enough so it feels like it has weight.Of course it is still a blockbuster film, and far from perfect, but it is impressively done and very easy to enjoy if you go with what it is doing.",1,0,1,0,0,0,0
Avengers: Endgame,"Minor spoilers.This is not the film I expected after the last Captain Marvel (Brie Larson). If you missed ""Ant-man and the Wasp"" that has an important tie-in. Brie Larson was in the film far less than expected. When you have so many Avengers on the screen at one time, it is hard for anyone to get a major part.After they did the Blues Brothers, we are getting the band back routine, they did a very awkward ""Back to the Future"" movie that did not work as well as planned. I expected Nebula would trick Thanos and get some stones followed by the mother of all battles led by Captain Marvel. They didn't make that film.The production had some good laugh lines and some hold back the tears moments. Not to give away too much, but it was rumored some stars didn't want to do the series anymore. They were given a Captain Kirk exit.And yes, there is, of course, the mother of all Avenger's battle which will be hard to top.Stan Lee as a driver.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Avengers: Endgame,"The 22nd film in Marvel Cinema Universe has an end of term feel about it. This shows with the lack of post credit scenes.With the population of the universe halved, Thanos has completed his task.The remainder of Earth superheroes try to retrieve the Infinity Gauntlet but Thanos destroyed it.It is the appearance of Ant Man who escapes from the Quantum Realm and shows up on Earth after five years that leads to a plan and it involves a Time Heist.What is left of the team go back to different time zones and different parts of the universe to collect the infinity gems. This means re-enacting scenes from previous Marvel films such as Captain America 2: The Winter Soldier. It leads to a moment where Robert Downey Jr, Tom Hiddleston, Chris Hemsworth all vie to be in the same shot with a particular superstar actor who supposedly called time on his acting career last year.It is a big spectacle, there is a major battle that comes across as flat when it needed to be better choreographed. There are some emotional scenes with some characters among the fallen.However this is one long movie. It needed to cut at least 45 minutes from its running time. The time travel elements might make sense in comics but not here.

Avengers: Endgame,"I usually do not watch movies twice in such a short amount of time. But after I did the Double Feature (at the Midnight premiere) with Infinity War almost 2 weeks ago, I re-watched Endgame yesterday and it was as amazing as my first impression of it was! And while I will not spoil anything about Endgame, I will talk about things Infinity War! So if you have not seen that yet, do not blame me for anything revealed here.My summary is a pop culture reference and there are quite a few in the Marvel movies, hinting at other franchises (Alien got name checked for example in Infinity War and even ""copied"" or ""homaged"" if you will and there are a few in Endgame too). But those little digs are not too important, they are just nice touches for those who know them. Having an understanding of the MCU as a whole, from Phase 1 to now Phase 3 is way more important. And as someone who is not too familiar with the comics myself, I can tell you that knowing the movies is enough to enjoy the franchise.Still you can google the other stuff or even make your own conclusions. Now that is a lot of foreword and I haven't even gotten one word about Endgame. But as I said above, no spoilers here. What we do know (from the trailers) is the beginning. But whatever we saw and thought we knew - what happens not even half an hour into the movie, will rattle you. Now what?Yes the first hour of the movie is ""slow"", but it had to be. There are ramifications after the snap and the characters we learned to love, that we have close to our heart, have been torn apart. Quite literally gone with the wind - everyone is thinking how is this going to be resolved (no pun intended)? And the movie will give you answers, and will even try to sort of explain things that are quite - unexplainable.And while there is full on drama, there is still a lot of humor. The movie takes beloved characters and does things to them - or rather the weight of what happened does things to them. What exactly? Well that would be telling, but let me tell you some very bold choices have been made. And if you are not emotional at least during some scenes, you are taking away a lot of fun for yourself.I can be a cynic too at times, but taking this apart (which you can do with every movie), is only hurting your own viewing pleasure. There is so much love in this, for the characters, for details, for the fans - it's just a rollercoaster and I'm not afraid to say that I shed a couple of tears. It is after all tying knots and bringing certain things to a conclusion.That doesn't mean there isn't anything more coming (because we know there is, next up Spiderman as an in between movie before Infinity War?). And there are some familiar faces coming back to Endgame from other movies that we haven't seen in a while but also new cameos like Ken Jeong. I'm guessing there will be a deleted scene with him, his scene seems to short for storytelling purposes I reckon.Epic fights, epic emotions and dialog that is hinting at things to come later in the movie ... which you will see even clearer with repeat viewing(s) ... The Russos did it - Kudos to them, Kevin Feige, Stan Lee (RIP) and everyone else involved in this of courseEdit: Endgame works even for people who have not seen a single MCU movie yet (confirmed by a friend of mine). But of course the gravitas and the conclusions of everything will work way better if you have seen the rest of the movies. Also let me add that this is ""technically sound"" as some would put it - or just plain great visually speaking. But I reckon this is a given anyway.

Avengers: Endgame,"So, it all came to this, the Marvel Cinematic Universe is the most financially and commercially successful superhero franchise for the last 12 years, and this was the conclusion to the Avengers storyline, the most anticipated, and highest-grossing movie of 2019 (it made $2 billion in 11 days, faster than Avatar, and surpassed the record of Titanic), it's the highest-grossing superhero movie of all time, directed by the Russo brothers (Welcome to Collinwood, You, Me and Dupree, Captain America: The Winter Soldier & Civil War). Basically half of all life on Earth was disintegrated by Thanos (Josh Brolin) and the Infinity Gauntlet. Carol Danvers aka Captain Marvel (Brie Larson) rescues Tony Stark aka Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) and Nebula (Karen Gillan), who were stranded in space following their defeat by Thanos on Titan. They reunite with the remaining Avengers: Bruce Banner aka Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Steve Rogers aka Captain America (Chris Evans), Rocket (Bradley Cooper), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Natasha Romanoff aka Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), and James Rhodes aka War Machine (Don Cheadle). They plan to retake the Infinity Stones and reverse the disintegrations, they locate and confront Thanos, but find that he has destroyed the Stones, in anger Thor kills Thanos. Five years later, Scott Lang aka Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) is returned (by chance) from the quantum realm to find the world devastated and half of the population disappeared in a snap. Scott finds Hope van Dyne aka The Wasp (Evangeline Lilly) and her father Dr. Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) have vanished but finds his daughter Cassie (Emma Fuhrmann) is now a teenager. Meanwhile, Rogers is attending grief counselling sessions for survivors still struggling following the wipe out, while Romanoff is at the Avengers' compound tirelessly keeping watch over both Earth and the rest of the universe with the help of Rhodes, Danvers, Okoye (Danai Gurira), Rocket, and Nebula. Lang returns to the compound; he explains that five years had only five hours for him in the quantum realm and theorises that it may be possible to build a time machine to reverse the annihilation. Stark refuses to help out of fear that he will lose his daughter Morgan (Lexi Rabe), who was born after the disintegration, but he talks with his wife Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), and does his own experiments. Banner has embraced the Hulk part of him, and melded himself and Hulk together as one, he agrees that it is possible to go back in time and steal the Infinity Stones before Thanos is able to collect them. Banner and Rocket travel to the small town of New Asgard, where Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson) and the last survivors of Asgard have settled, they are shocked to Thor overwhelmed by guilt, with overgrown hair and overweight, eating junk, drinking, and playing video games with his friends Korg (Taika Waititi) and Miek, but they eventually convince him to return. Romanoff recruits Clint Barton aka Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), now a ruthless vigilante after his family was disintegrated. Initial experiments with the time machine with Lang go awry, but Stark arrives to shows them his findings to perfect it, and testing it with Barton, it is confirmed that it works. The Avengers plan which places in time to travel to where the five Infinity Stones are located. Banner, Lang, Rogers, and Stark travel to the battle of New York City in 2012 (Avengers Assemble) to retrieve the Time, Mind, and Space Stones. Banner visits the Sanctum Sanctorum and convinces the Ancient One (Tilda Swinton) to give him the Time Stone. Rogers successfully retrieves the Mind Stone, after battling with himself. Stark and Lang's interference inadvertently allows Loki (Tom Hiddleston) to escape with the Space Stone. But Stark remembers the Space Stone being in S.H.I.E.L.D. headquarters in 1970, he and Rogers travel back to retrieve it, Rogers sights Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), and Stark has a meaningful conversation with his father Howard (John Slattery). Rocket and Thor travel to Asgard in 2013 (Thor: The Dark World) to extract the Reality Stone from Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), while there Thor has a conversation with his mother Frigga (Rene Russo), as it is the day she will be killed, which he cannot reverse, and he retrieves his hammer Mjolnir. Nebula and Rhodes travel to Morag in 2014 (Guardians of the Galaxy) and steal the Power Stone before Peter Quill aka Star-Lord (Chris Pratt) can. Rhodes returns to the present with the Power Stone, but Nebula is unable to return, her cybernetic interface has connected with that of her past self. Through this connection, the past version of Thanos learns of his future success and the plan of the Avengers to undo it. Thanos captures Nebula and sends past Nebula to the present day disguised as her future self. Barton and Romanoff travel to Vormir in the same year and learn that the Soul Stone requires the death of a loved one, they argue which of them should sacrifice themselves, but ultimately Romanoff falls to her death, allowing Barton to obtain the Soul Stone. Reuniting in the present, the Avengers fit the five Stones into a Stark-created gauntlet. Banner volunteers himself to wield the gauntlet, reasoning that he can withstand the radiation poisoning and the immense pain brought on by using the Stones. The snap of Banner's fingers is successful, all those disintegrated are resurrected, and one of the two of the group reunite with loved ones. However, past Nebula uses the time machine to transport past Thanos and his warship to the present, he attacks the Avengers compound. Nebula convinces past Gamora (Zoe Saldana) to turn against Thanos, and kills her past self, while Stark, Rogers and Thor battle Thanos. Doctor Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) arrives with other sorcerers, the Avengers: T'Challa aka Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman), Peter Parker aka Spider-Man (Tom Holland), Wanda Maximoff aka Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) and Sam Wilson aka Falcon (Anthony Mackie), the Guardians of the Galaxy: Drax (Dave Bautista) and Groot (Vin Diesel), and the armies of Wakanda, Asgard, and the Ravagers. The fight between good and evil begins, Danvers arrives and destroys Thanos' warship, and Thanos seizes the gauntlet, but Stark maneuvers the Infinity Stones from his hand to his own, clicks his fingers, turning Thanos and his entire army into dust. Parker and Potts console Stark as he dies from radioactive overexposure to the Stones. A funeral is held for Stark, with all the Avengers, including leader Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), the Guardians of the Galaxy, Wakandans, Asgardians, and all other associated characters, attending. Barton and Wanda take solace in the fact that Romanoff and Vision did not return in the snap. Thor makes Valkyrie the Queen of Asgard, he joins the Guardians of the Galaxy to find his true purpose, free of the burden of royalty and leadership. Barton returns home to his family and Parker returns to school, where he is reunited with his best friend Ned (Jacob Batalon). Meanwhile, Rogers is tasked to go into the past to return the Infinity Stones and Thor's hammer to their original time lines, but after doing so, he chose to remain in the past to live a full life. Rogers appears before Wilson and his friend Bucky Barnes aka Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan) as an old man, he passes his shield and the mantle of Captain America on to Wilson, and a flashback reveals that he finally found happiness with Peggy Carter. By the way, there is no post-credits sequence, only some sound effects. Also starring Benedict Wong as Wong, Pom Klementieff as Mantis, Letitia Wright as Shuri, Jon Favreau as Happy Hogan, Marisa Tomei as Aunt May, Angela Bassett as Ramonda, Michelle Pfeiffer as Janet Van Dyne, William Hurt as Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross, Cobie Smulders as Maria Hill, Winston Duke as M'Baku, Linda Cardellini as Laura Barton, Maximiliano Hernández as Agent Sitwell, Frank Grillo as Brock Rumlow, Ring's Hiroyuki Sanada as Akihiko, Tom Vaughan-Lawlor as Ebony Maw, James D'Arcy as Jarvis, Robert Redford as Alexander Pierce, Ross Marquand as Red Skull (Stonekeeper) and a posthumous cameo by Stan Lee as a 1970s Driver. You will almost not notice or care about the three hour running time, it is a story in three acts: the devastation of the world, time travelling to reverse it all, and the battle to save the world, the cast playing the superheroes and the villains are all great, it is the characters that really add to it all, it has good humour, it has amazing special effects, fight sequences and spectacle, and it gets you emotionally as well, a fantastic and fitting conclusion to the saga, a brilliant fantasy action adventure. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Visual Effects, and it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Special Visual Effects. Very good!",1,1,0,0,0,1,1
Avengers: Endgame,"Given the hype and the huge buildup to the opening of this movie, I wouldn't have expected any less of a reaction than what I find on these review boards. And to be fair, the film does encompass and bring to a finale a massive story line with a virtually complete cast of characters that form the Marvel Comics Universe. However a little bit of objectivity is in order, and the movie's current standing after three days of release (as I write this) is just a bit hard to fathom. At number five on IMDb's list of Top Rated Movies, I can only shake my head. Think of your absolutely favorite movie of all time, (unless this one is it), and ""Avengers: Endgame"" has just surpassed it. This is a pet peeve of mine and I've written about it before in my reviews, so I don't want to get carried away here. Suffice it to say that for me, any brand new release to achieve such a ranking isn't really a reflection to how good it is, but a response by the majority of fans who come to these pages to give it a top rating.So rather than being a complete killjoy, I thought the movie was good for what it was, but it took quite a stretch to bring back the characters who went missing following Infinity War. The plot utilizes the time worn (no pun intended), time travel gimmick to hurl the principal heroes back to three (or four) different pasts in order to undo the havoc created by Thanos (Josh Brolin) and his destructive use of the Infinity Stones. For once, one of the characters, can't remember who it was, stated that going into the past is really creating a new future, so that the present reality eventually becomes the past. I liked that because if you think it through, that's exactly correct. But in so doing, a whole lot gets muddled as the story progresses, and the idea that Thanos 'used the stones to destroy the stones' makes everything that follows feel like the writers making it up as they went along. Which of course, is what they did, but you know what I mean.There are a lot of huh? moments in the picture - fat Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is one - why? Thor cutting off Thanos's head another - too easy, why not any time prior? Stuff like that demeans credibility and took me out of the picture for a moment. Captain America (Chris Evans) battling himself? Doctor Strange's (Benedict Cumberbatch) circular reasoning - ""If I tell you what happens, it won't happen"". Enough stuff like this makes it all a bit muddled to follow, especially when things reach a fever pitch and the last hour descends into a gigantic free for all.But there were interesting elements in the picture. I liked what the writers did with the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), even if he didn't go into 'Smash' mode much. The fully functioning time/space GPS conjured up by Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) was kind of nifty, Elon Musk will probably start working on that any day now. I take with a few grains of salt that Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) died at the end, because, you know, no one dies in the comic book world and lives to tell about it. See, I could be a film writer too. Best of all, I'm glad the film makers got a chance to insert Stan Lee into that 1970 time line scene, because he's my favorite Marvel character, and even though he's not around any more, he'll live on as a result of all his story writing and Marvel movie appearances.In summation, by all means, see the movie, but keep things in perspective. I may see things differently after watching it a second or third time, but right now, my initial reaction is tempered with some reservation. It didn't help that there was no after credits scene, but I guess that was the point. What comes next is anybody's guess.",0,-999,-999,-999,-999,-999,-999
Avengers: Endgame,"After 'the vanishing' in Infinity War, there were still a handful of superheroes left knocking about to try and restore order to the universe, but in Endgame the real hero is a rat. A lowly rodent scampers across the controls of Hank Pym's quantum machine, activating a few switches with his little ratty feet, bringing Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) back from his five-year stay in the quantum realm. And it is Lang's return that kick-starts a desperate attempt to reverse Thanos' nefarious handiwork.If you can swallow such lazy writing, then you'll no doubt have no problem with the rest of the film, which resorts to that old chestnut - time travel - with all the paradoxical problems that arise as a result. Unfortunately, I struggle to let such things slide, annoyed by rather casual approach taken by writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, whose script scampers lightly over the temporal issues like a rat over a console (I'm sorry, I just can't let that go). While the film is undeniably enjoyable as a slam bang piece of mega-budget entertainment, it isn't as flawless or as clever a denouement that one might hope for.Visually, Endgame is hard to beat and it's great to see all of the A-list stars of the past MCU movies coming together for one last effects-filled battle (it's amazing what $400,000,000 can buy), but for the culmination of a twenty-two film series, I had dearly hoped for something a bit more considered and fulfilling than a great-looking movie that is ultimately dependent on the actions of a rat (yes, it irritated me THAT much...).",-1,-999,-1,-999,-999,-999,-999
Avengers: Endgame,"My wife and I watched this movie at home on DVD from our public library, about 11 months after we similarly watched ""Infinity War"" where Thanos wanted to destroy half the universe.In fact the very first scene of this one depicts people, parts of families, just disappearing. Thanos is so powerful, and possessing all the infinity stones, would take a giant coordinated effort by all the Avengers to figure out a way to defeat him. And only some kind of time travel to secure each infinity stone would enable them to accomplish what is needed.The movie is long, very long, at just over 3 hours with the credits.

Avengers: Endgame,"Well, I finally got around to watching ""Avengers: Endgame"", even though I already watched ""Spider-Man: Far from Home"", so I already knew some of the events that were to transpire in ""Avengers: Endgame"". And I am not really fond of the superhero genre, but I still watch the movies when given the chance, as they are usually visually fantastic and provide adequate entertainment. And of course with all the hype that ""Avengers: Endgame"" had gotten, of course I just had to sit down and watch it.First of all, the movie was long. A little bit too long actually. I did feel that directors Anthony Russo and Joe Russo were taking their sweet time getting to the core of the storyline, and just dancing around the bushes. In my opinion, the movie did suffer from this.Visually, well let's just go with 'wow'. Yeah, the movie was phenomenally stunning to look at visually given the CGI and special effects. But of course, being a Marvel movie, then you'd have top of the line special effects. And it is the visuals that carry the superhero movies quite a long way down the road.Story-wise, then I felt that the plot and storyline portrayed in ""Avengers: Endgame"" was a little bit too predictable and too generic. You already knew the movie's outcome when you sat down to watch it. Of course, Marvel weren't going to kill off a heap of their most beloved characters. No chance of that happening. So there weren't really much of any surprises along the way. And the time traveling aspect of the movie? Seriously? That was just downright idiotic.What worked for the movie, aside from the great visuals, was the impressive ensemble of actors and actresses that made an appearance in bigger or smaller parts throughout the course of the movie. Thumbs up for that. However, I found some of the dialogue to be a bit too corny and felt that it was written for a young audience.Was ""Avengers: Endgame"" a fulfilling closure to the Marvel storyline? Hardly so. The movie, while being entertaining enough, felt a bit shallow, with parts of the story quite poorly written. But if you, like me, come to the superhero movies mostly for the special effects, then ""Avengers: Endgame"" will definitely blow you away.All in all, I am rating ""Avengers: Endgame"" a six out of ten stars.",0,1,-1,0,0,1,1

Avengers: Endgame,"I haven't heard more people upset about spoilers since the Star Wars prequels, so please consider this sentence the spoiler space you very well may need if you don't want to learn more. Then again, I'm going to discuss the idea of this film more than the actual movie itself.Avengers: Endgame is the blockbuster of 2019. It's a juggernaut that has the biggest cast of any superhero film ever, wrapping up almost 12 years of storyline and multiple movies, all to answer the question that came up at the end of Avengers: Infinity War: after you kill half of everything, what happens next?There's been a lot of soapboxing and online hand wringing about this film. Plenty of people feel the need to show that they're above the paltry populace, happy to proclaim their intellectual superiority and state that comic book related films demand that adults remain stuck in the days of adolescence. Much like the issues of today's politics, I'm not going to change anyone's mind that feels that way. All that ends up is two people shouting their talking points and refusing to learn anything from one another. But my snide comment is this: can't you just leave well enough alone?This is a popcorn movie that appeals to the biggest audience ever. And that's fine. You can ignore it if you like - we've never lived in a time where there's more opportunity to enjoy the media that you want. Me, I ignore mumblecore, critic beloved films and Oscar-bait movies for the most part. And that is also fine.All that I know is that I've seen nearly every Marvel film with the same set of guys that I've seen movies with since I was 25 or so. Each movie is an event where we get the chance to grab a meal, catch up and enjoy one another's company in the midst of our exceedingly stressful and busy lives. If a movie can do that, it's already a success before you even watch one frame. Movies bring us together, a light on the cave wall where we can hear a fantastic tale that's bigger than us. That's what this movie is - modern mythology of larger than life heroes who are the best of all of us battling the worst villains possible.Spoiler warning part two - here's where I get into major plot points. You've been warned.More than the overall tale, I enjoyed the story beats here. Hawkeye becoming Ronin, enraged that evil survived the purge while his family did not. The main sacrifice of this film isn't Black Widow's, but his. He was the first person who saw her as more than a killing machine and gave her a chance at life. Now, she repays the favor, taking him from killing machine back to family man. However, he must sacrifice their friendship and the knowledge that her loss will always be in the background when measured against the perceived greater loss of Iron Man.But hey - I've always loved the background characters more than the heavy hitters.There are moments here that really portray what the three main Avengers have had to give up to protect us. Iron Man must lose the stability and family he never knew he needed. Captain America's longing for Agent Carter, trapped by a glass wall that may as well be decades and not inches thick. Thor's descent into depression as he realizes that he couldn't save the day. Their fates each show them finally achieving the final part of their hero's journey save Thor, who is fated to repeat his journey over and over throughout rebirth after rebirth, even after Ragnarok, the end of all things.Those small moments mean more than the big explosions and special effects throughout this film. Tony's quick hug with his unsuspecting father. Thor's moment with his mother, who sees right through his deceptions. Even Quill's way too brief reunion with Gamora. The heart behind each charcter is why we care. There are hundreds of superpowered characters on the screen. The fact that we know the minute motivations of more than one of them is a credit to this tale.I love that this film both wraps up and begins new stories at its close. Sam Wilson must become Captain America, finally receiving the approval and friendship of the Winter Soldier. Thor realizes that his role is to be an adventurer, not the king, and gives the ownership of Asgard to Valkyrie. Even Steve Rogers realizes that despite becoming a grief counselor and telling people to live the new life they've been given, when the opportunity arises to return to his life, it's one he should embrace.Speaking of Rogers, I haven't heard an audience start cheering in the theater for a long time. The fact that he's able to lift Mjolnir, Thor's hammer, was not lost on this audience. Before, he was able to budge it. Now, his journey has made him truly worthy to lead the forces against Thanos, even if he appears alone at the seeming conclusion of the final battle.I also like the synchronicity that the first words that kicked off the Marvel cinematic universe were Tony Stark saying, ""I am Iron Man,"" which are also his last words. There's just something poetic about that.Hey look - I was happy that Crossbones got a few seconds of screentime. I'm that kind of geek. And if that fact upsets you, I'm never going to convince you that this is a good movie.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Avengers: Endgame,". . . (that is, CNN and MSNBC) have labeled our current threat to Life the USA as we've known it as Washington: Endgame, in apparent homage to AVENGERS: ENDGAME. Where these courageous news outlets may differ amongst themselves is in regard to which facets of the Armageddon-like Final Battle of the movie represent who, among the Axis of Evil's Real Life gathering of Satanic Forces. While ""R. Maddow"" on MSNBC has not been shy about pointing out that the cinema Bad Guy's Giant Flying Slug is a dead ringer for POTUS #45, CNN's ""A. Cooper"" seems equally convinced that this flick's ""Thanos"" is met to represent ""The Teflon Don."" Today, in THIS Reality, as ""Little Rocket Man"" is initiating the World's Nuclear Meltdown, as Iran verges on erasing Israel, as the USA's cold Trade War with Red Commie China is a nuclear football away from turning Red Hot, and as ""Mad Vlad"" Putin's henchman (aka, the White House Pawn, aka the KGB Puppet) declares himself ""President for Life,"" does it really matter whether Rachel or Anderson is the most correct?",0,-999,-999,-999,-999,-999,-999
Avengers: Endgame,"This is made by people who do, for people who do, and this movie itself, does, love the MCU. You can think of it as a TV show finale. After 21 episodes that are all feature length. And before you can even say ""oh no those are all terrible"", this immediately proves itself to be an exception to that rule. Where the equally masterful Infinity War was almost one long action climax, this is less about fights. Which doesn't mean it doesn't have any. Or that they're anything less than excellent. And this film is definitely never boring. This focuses on character exploration. Every member of the original Avengers team, and a handful individuals that aren't, all get significant depth. I remain one of the few people who argue that Age of Ultron did deliver that, albeit in small concentrated format. This easily tops that. Everyone is pushed into a situation new to them. The trailers hint at some of these, whilst leaving others as incredible surprises. Make sure you avoid spoilers before watching this.This picture moves fast and packs a lot into its not quite lean running time. In other words, it's directed by the Russo Brothers. The length is justified. I wouldn't cut anything from this. The emotional moments don't feel sappy. The countless callbacks and references don't feel like they're just there to make you feel good for paying attention to all that lead to this one. The acting shows just how well all of these performers understand the characters. And the screenplay does the same for the writers. The effects are astonishing, yet again getting us to care about individuals that we know are all CG. It uses the varied skills, equipment and the like, of the unique heroes and villains, creatively. This delivers deeply satisfying closure. It truly is a conclusion. It's not trying to get you back to the theatre for the next adventure. The few currently confirmed entries into this franchise don't need hyping, anyway. Spider-Man with Mysterio? Another Black Panther story? The unfairly fired James Gunn returning to round out the trilogy of the Guardians of the Galaxy? Solo Black widow, *finally*? More Dr Strange? Shang-Chi, The Eternals, Blade? Keep 'em coming.I recommend this to everyone who's taken this entire journey. And if you're someone who's skipped some, or held off on this series up to this point, this is an excellent reason to address that. Unless they're simply not to your liking. This is not going to change that. It's not meant to. 10/10",1,1,0,0,0,1,1

Avengers: Endgame,"Greetings again from the darkness. In what was originally titled ""Avengers: Infinity War Part 2"", we get the much-anticipated conclusion to the most recent 22 Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) films ... specifically Phase 3. Regardless if you are a deep-rooted fanboy or a casual viewer, you likely know the questions heading into this finale:Can the Avengers defeat Thanos?
What role will Captain Marvel (and her pixie haircut) play?
Will those who died in AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR be brought back to life?
Will Tony Stark/Iron Man make it back from drifting in space?
Who will survive this final battle?We knew this one had to be big, and in fact, it's colossal/humongous/monumental ... whatever your preferred adjective might be. And you can rest easy knowing that all of the above questions are answered quite clearly in this 3 hour epic from co-director brothers Anthony Russo and Joe Russo and co-writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely (the same directors and writers behind AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR and a few other MCU entries).Marvel has excelled over the past decade plus by combining interesting characters, understandable story lines, visually stunning effects, and clever humor. This finale offers all of that and more. In fact, it's difficult to imagine a more perfect ending to this galactic odyssey ... and I don't offer that praise lightly. From the use of Traffic's classic ""Dear Mr. Fantasy"" and a gut-wrenching opening scene that yanks us right back into that feeling of dread provided by 'Infinity War', we know we are in for a ride that is quite a bit more somber and even more emotional than what we've come to expect.The fallout from the Thanos snap is clear as we catch up with Black Widow, Captain America, Thor and Hulk. Each is dealing on their own terms, and while the Banner-Hulk merger is quite something to behold, trust me when I say, you've never imagined seeing Thor in his current state. This marks Chris Evans' 10th film as Captain America, and he is front and center through much of the film - as is, in a bit of a surprise, Karen Gillan as Nebula. It makes sense given her tie to Thanos, and Ms. Gillan holds up quite well in the spotlight.Since the previous and speculation has been on time travel and the Quantum Realm, brace yourself for a bit of convoluted talk about how that works, but that's the closest thing to a negative I have to offer - and even that is offset by numerous punchlines at the expense of BACK TO THE FUTURE and most every other time travel movie ever made.The theatre was packed with Dallas area critics and industry folks, and there was a significant amount of cheering, applauding and more than a few sniffles. Yes, this one will take you on an emotional journey as well as a visual one. It has a tough/emotional beginning and a tough/emotional ending. These are characters we've gotten to know over multiple films ... and you should know just about every major or mid-major character from every Marvel film makes an appearance, as do numerous minor ones. It's quite a remarkable reunion. And yes, the brilliance of Tilda Swinton as The Ancient One more than offsets the Pepper Potts scenes.Creator Stan Lee does get his final posthumous cameo (good for more applause), and there is a 'women's movement' moment that seems to be Marvel's ""we hear you"" statement. Much of what we see is ""inevitable"", but as the Avengers assemble this last time, we are there to laugh, cry and gasp. This is what happens when 'over-the-top' is 'just right'.",1,1,1,1,0,1,1
Avengers: Endgame,"Here it is then, after eleven years and twenty one movies of differing quality, we finally reach the Endgame.But does it deliver?Does it really live up to Infinity Wars sombre ending?Yes, my goodness yes, and despite my expectations being stupendously high on the verge of me thinking that I would not enjoy it, it's easily one of the most satisfying cinema experiences that I have ever experienced.The trailer would lead you to believe that this film would be emotionally draining, the most serious of the MCU, but there is as much humour in this than any of the other phase entries, and they are genuine laugh out loud moments.But the humour does not pull the viewer away from the emotional pull that the characters pour on to the screen, and with every laugh out loud moment, there are some gut punches the film gives that will leave you reeling, if you've been even semi-invested in this behemoth of a cinematic universe.At just over three hours, Endgame truly does not feel like that, and throws some wonderful curve-balls for almost every main character, and Kudos to the Russo Brothers, they give each character a goal, an ambition, that makes you care all the more for their quest.The main meat of the film is the strained relationship between Stark and Rogers, reluctance, denial, guilt, anguish, and anger all play a part when they are together on screen.The second act is the foundation of the film, it's genius, almost jaw-dropping in the fact that it shouldn't make sense, it could easily fail, but the writers have so much respect for the franchise, and filmgoers, that it works so effortlessly.To say a lot about the third act would to give too much away, but viewers will not be disappointed. It delivers on a grandiose scale, almost delusional, but its awe-inspiring stuff.You know not to read any spoilers, and unfortunately they are so easy to find, but everyone knows not to.But rest assured, it left me stunned, satisfied and teary eyed.Marvel have done something epic, and there will not be a film like this around for a very long time.",1,0,0,1,0,0,0
Avengers: Endgame,"I loved Infinity Wars, it being a totally awesome comic book film that did a great job of having dream team ups and great action and fights. Thanos was an awesome villain that looked unstoppable at times and seeing him snap and reduce half the population to ash was epic. One thing I have to say about this film is that I have never enjoyed a film so much while at the same time being disappointed with it. Was it epic? Yes, but it did not feel as epic as Infinity Wars. Did the main cast do a good job? Yes, but I felt the direction the story went was not all that good. It just seemed very off to me personally. I was not expecting them to rush off to where Thanos was and kill him with ease and then get the five years later line. I just did not care for that at all. They made too much time pass in between the snap and the reformation of the team and a new plan. There are other things that bothered me, but I did enjoy the action and the humor and other aspects of this film...it just was not as good as Infinity War.The story starts out showing us that Hawkeye lost his entire family to the snap which seems a bit against the odds as it were. Then we shift to Tony Stark in space afloat and seemingly near death with Nebula when Captain Marvel comes to the rescue and the gang manage to track Thanos down and kill him after learning he disposed of the stones. Five years later, Ant-man resurfaces from the Quantum realm and somehow manages to come up with a going back in time plot that seems out of his area of expertise. Well, soon the Avengers are back together and planning to get the infinity stones so they can snap everyone back into existence; unfortunately, the Thanos of the past comes to learn of this plan and makes a plan of his own to get the stones the heroes collect.The film was good, but it had problems, as I felt the film was just jamming characters in the film to make as many characters appear as possible. In Infinity Wars it felt more seamless and natural how things fell, this one it felt forced. We have not even seen Pepper in Rescue before in the films, but she shows up here. I was on the fence about Captain Marvel before, when I saw her in her own film, but now I am more sure...I don't care for her. I do not get the goofy ass smile she has like she is superior to everyone else. In the comics the likes of Thor, Hulk would annihilate her in a one on one battle, yet it looks to me like they are setting her up to be the number one Marvel hero going forward and it sucks as she is not that huge of a player in the comic world. The whole females teaming together to get her through the enemies was stupid too, mainly because if she just flies the opposite way, there are no enemies and she could have easily gotten the infinity gauntlet out of there! They went with the total wimp Hulk in this one too, kept expecting him to redeem himself against Thanos after the butt kicking he got, but nope, he was a non factor in the final battle. In the comic Hulk is stronger than Thanos physically to the point Thanos has said he would not go toe to toe with the Hulk as it would be an unwinnable endeavor. The good news the main Avengers save the film and make you enjoy it more than you would if it had Captain Marvel leading the charge. The originals keep you watching despite the flaws in certain areas of the film.So, I enjoyed this one a lot, and I do like it better than Age of Ultron; however, it is not as good as the first film or Infinity Wars. The original cast is good and keeps you watching even though you know that some of them are not going to make it through the film. Unfortunately, if the future is Brie Larson as Captain Marvel then phase four of the Marvel plan is not looking so bright in my eyes. Not sure if it is too late to recast her or not, but she has no charisma. I will still watch sequels such as Spider-man, Guardians, Black Panther and Dr. Strange, but some of the movies they have planned for the future have me scratching my head. I always thought the Marvel Universe had more heroes than that of DC, but they seem to really be running out and relegating several big name heroes to series rather than big screen. Still, this one ends the infinity saga and not sure what they could ever do to top it and the infinity gauntlet anyways.",1,1,-1,0,0,0,0
Avengers: Endgame,"I would be lying if I said that I wasn't a little disappointed. The Avengers: Endgame has been one of the most anticipated movies since... well since The Force Awakens but that was way back in 2015 and in this day and age that's like a million years ago. The point being: Endgame was the talk of the town since all of those beloved MCU characters faded away. Infinity War was such an epic movie what could Marvel do as an encore? Or better still, what could Marvel do to conclude the magnificent journey they took us on?If anything, Endgame proves that it's hard to write a perfect ending. Perfect endings are stuff of legend. Whether the ending has a twist, a ride off into the sunset, or a mixed bag they are hard to write and hard to execute. Endgame is supposed to be just as the title suggests: the end. This is where the Avengers wrap it all up. Endgame was one long goodbye and it seems they tried to make it as heartfelt and dramatic as possible.Infinity War started with a bang and ended with a bang. It was a fast moving roller coaster throughout. It came together so nicely with all the different characters, the different tasks, and the different battles. It was a superb blend of flavors that came together for an excellent meal. Endgame, on the other hand, was almost like a decompression. If you were huffing and puffing from Infinity War then Endgame was a chance for you to rest, catch your breath, and absorb all of what happened. It was a long slow exhale with just one last burst of energy before retiring. And it wasn't what I was expecting.Not that getting what one expects is necessary to be considered good because sometimes you can be surprised in the best way. After all, we've trusted Marvel thus far so no reason not to trust them to put the finishing touches on their masterpiece. Now that I've seen their final brush strokes and the completed work I have to say that their hand slipped a little when adding the finishing touches.Like a fireworks show or a symphony I wanted the ending to be this huge crescendo. I'm not talking simply about the last 20-30 minutes of the movie, but the entire movie. I wanted to see all of the fine Marvel characters in their finest form, or close to it, as they went for their last hurrah. I wanted them all to be like John Elway retiring after his second Super Bowl, retiring on top, not Muhammad Ali who held on too long and had a less than flattering exit from boxing. But that's not what I got.We got to see heroics, of course it's a superhero film, but it was so subdued. The entire tone of the movie was muted. It was a somber morose three hours. The humor wasn't as humorous. The fighting was somehow less awesome. Everything was just darker and more lifeless. Even the hero moments which were supposed to evoke the most joy, awe, and righteous triumph didn't quite do it. Now it could be because it was 12 a.m. by the time the movie wrapped up and I was tired but I don't think that was it. Many a movie has revived me due to it's captivation. End Game didn't revive me or stir me in the way I thought it should. If anything, they put me to rest along with the Avengers saga. I was going for a conclusion, yes, but I also wanted reinvigoration and revival. Sadly, I got solemn and subdue",-1,-999,-999,-999,-999,-999,-999
Avengers: Endgame,"Maybe it's better to see Infinity War (2018) because it do picks up what is left of that particular flick. Clocking in over 3 hours it was for me way too long to watch.Maybe no-one will understand me but 3 hours it has to be good. And it do has it moments building up to the fight towards the last part of this flick but it also has a lot of boring moments and moments were they are talking too much.I's towards the last half hour that it really becomes what you're waiting for, the endgame. As said, it's not all that bad but the irritating conversations of Tony Stark made me yawn a lot and even reach for the remote control.Nice to see that Spiderman is involved sadly we do know by now that it could be a once in your lifetime experience. DC and Marvel coming together, not for Disney anymore. Money makes the world goes around.

The web-series delves into minutes details which will be interesting even for the folks who come from non-financial background. A big shout out to team of writers which includes Sumit Purohit (Inside Edge), Karan Vyas (Ventilator) and Vaibhav Vishal.Scam 1992 is flavored with a brilliant background by Achint Thakkar, transformed you into the beautiful era of Mumbai in 90's with magnificent cinematography by Pratham Mehta, splendid art direction by Nida Shaikh (Once Upon A Time In Mumbai), outstanding production design by Tarpan Shrivastava (Dishoom) and Payal Ghose and a eye-catching costume design by Arun J Chauhan (Zindagai Na Milegi Dobara). May be the story of rise and fall of Harshad Mehta seemed bit long but you cannot miss the sharp editing by Kunal Walve, though I would still argue that series could have shortened by few episodes.Scam 1992 boast of some of the finest performances of this year. To start with first and the foremost is Pratik Gandhi who gives a knockout performance as he deep-dives into the body language of Harshad Mehta with a Gujarat accent. This is one of the actor who needs to be watch out for. Shreya Dhanwanthary is simply superb as Sucheta Dalal who investigated and exposed the Harshad Mehta scam. I loved her in the scene where Sucheta gives a befitting reply to Harshad Mehta when he tries to bribe her with an exuberant salary. Apart from these, the actor who play Harshad's brother was good along with Nikhil Dwivedi, Ananth Mahadevan, Rajat Kapoor and Satish Kaushik.On the whole, Scam 1992 has raised the bar of the Indian web series with its magnificent direction, brilliant performances and captivating story.

When they said Harshad Mehta, all it comes to the mind was that the person is a fraud and has looted a lot of public's money.
But, after watching this series it was more like the whole system and not just 1-2 persons committing this thing, it was more like the absence of the policies which made everyone, mainly the big players to take advantage of the system in a certain way to manipulate the markets and control it & earn big sums up to their own advantages. All of this changed after this scam was exposed.
This series gave a wholesome view into the life of Mehta & his brother who later became a lawyer and is still practising it in Bombay High court and about their family & personal lives which was like more inspiring than the scam itself.
The man was living off with a lot of positive energy which makes him as a hero to few people in the market.

Scam 1992: The Harshad Mehta Story,"Scam 1992 (Web-series) review :Its been more than a month since this web-series premiered on Sony Liv; so in today's era, where reviews pop up almost minutes after a film or show goes live on OTT (wonder how??!!!), my take would appear a bit too late for all those who have already watched it. Probably, I wouldn't have bothered reviewing it now if the content was crap but thats not the case here. Scam 1992 is one of the best series Ive seen this year so naturally, review toh banta hai boss!!Based on Sucheta Dalal and Debashish Basu's book, Scam 1992 gives an accurate account of the stock market scam perpetuated by stock broker Harshad Mehta who was referred as the Big Bull in those days. From his modest start as a jobber in the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE), the web series chronicles his rise to unprecedented levels as he virtually controls the Dalaal street (BSE's second name) to his downfall as he languishes in jail for a securities fraud running in to ten thousand of crores. Whoa!!Director Hansal Mehta is in top form as he not only lends a racy pace to his narrative but also explains the complicated financial terms in layman language to his audience. The manner in which Harshad Mehta manipulated the entire system through non existent Bank Receipts (BRs) is authentically depicted. The infamous press conference where Harshad's lawyer Ram Jethmalani accused the then Prime Minister of accepting a one crore bribe is intercut with actual images.The casting is also a triumph. Pratik Gandhi is outstanding as Harshad, the scamster who prides himself to be called Amitabh Bachchan of the share market. In one scene, we see him getting his suit stitched from Bachchan's tailor, no less. His cool attitude almost makes us root for him like an antihero until we see the horrid repurcussions of his insatiable ambition.Shreya Dhanwanthary plays Sucheta Dalal, a Times of India scribe, who uncovers the muck which starts from Mumbai's Dalal street and extends right up to the New Delhi parliament. Her performance is brilliant to say the least. Here is an actor to watch out for in the future. Undoubtedly!!The supporting cast - Ananth Mahadevan as the RBI Governor, Satish Kaushik as the foul mouthed stock bear Manu bhai, Lalit Parimoo as the CBI director and Rajat Kapoor as the investigating officer - are top notch. It is pleasant surprise to see Amjad Khan's son Shadab as the rival broker Kedia who abhors Harshad.Blending great content with equally fantastic performances, Scam 1992 is not to be missed at any cost. Do yourself a favour if you havent watched it yet. This is a bluechip material indeed!!!Regards,

Scam 1992: The Harshad Mehta Story,"Scam 1992: The Harshad Mehta story is a web series from Sony Liv created by acclaimed filmmaker Hansal Mehta narrates the real life story of Harshad Mehta (Pratik Gandhi) who after feeling unsatisfied with his life as a salesperson decides to enter into stock market. With his determination and cleverness, he rises from a stock broker to a stock leader in the early 90s. But his overambitions lead to him making money illegally which gets exposed through times of India journalist Suchitha Dalal (Shreya Dhanwantry) which leads to his gradual downfall turning him into a criminal and noted person in the eyes of law.
I didn't know anything much about the Harshad Mehta scam story due to I was getting a fresh viewing experience while watching this series. I didn't binge watch and took my own time in finishing the series, at that time I didn't even try to search about the actual story in internet so that my viewing experience doesn't get affected. And the last episode made me sad and gave me the same feeling when I finished watching ford Vs Ferrari. That movie too I saw without knowing the real story. Harshad Mehta may not be a good person, but I liked about him in this series was his determination and daring attitude. I hoped him to bounce back in the final episodes with this attitude. Pratik Gandhi owns the show completely. Physically, he didn't resemble Harshad Mehta but got into his skin and lived like him and conveyed all the emotions well. I wish him to get more great opportunities in this industry. The supporting cast were also equally brilliant with many unknown actors as well as seasoned actors. My favourite was Rajat Kapoor as the CBI officer madhavan who appeared only in few episodes sometimes making one feel that he is the second hero. Cinematography was standard and art direction presented very well the 90s Bombay. Script is very engaging. There are 10 episodes with a runtime of 40-50 minutes which explores in detail the story.
On the whole, scam 1992:the Harshad Mehta story is a very well made web series. Even though the stock terms used and the business didn't get into my head, the script,performances and direction kept me hooked throughout.

Scam 1992: The Harshad Mehta Story,"Scam 1992: The Harshad Mehta Story's 10-episode web series resurrects the broker who was once celebrated as the ""Big Bull"" of the Bombay bourse for his ability to keep riding the rising market. Mehta was celebrated as a financial wunderkind who shook up an archaic system and transformed Mumbai's Dalal Street into New York City's Wall Street.In the beginning of the series Harshad Mehta, the trader mentions four elements - research, risk, passion and luck. But he omits the one thing that transported him from a cramped chawl in the distant suburbs of Mumbai to a sprawling terrace apartment in a posh neighbourhood that faced the sea and had its own swimming pool. Crookedness, the fifth element, served Harshad Mehta exceedingly well. Without crookedness, he might have remained a jobber at the Bombay Stock Exchange or, at best, a mid-level operator throughout his life.Though the series has an excellent ""adapted"" screenplay based on a book written by the lead journalist Sucheta Dalal, who is portrayed in a stellar performance by Shreya Dhanwanthary in the series. Pratik Gandhi donning the role of Harshad Mehta delivers a very good performance ably supported by by some very good supporting actors. But the production design falters big time mainly owing to budget constraints. Editing, costumes and makeup are good. Music is well handled for a series of this nature. Scam 1992, however popular it may be, is definitely not Hansal Mehta's best work.Overall, though not exceptional as per the rating here 9.5 which I believe is grossly exaggerated if one considers the merits. Scam 1992 works perfectly as long as it is tethered to what we know about Harshad Mehta's rank unscrupulousness. Paradoxically, the series begins to lose focus after the fraud becomes apparent and becomes a little predictable therein. However the web series is a must watch for everyone who doesn't want the regular run a mill storyline or the regular crime dramas. A poor production design and some glaring errors and omissions drags a couple of points, in an otherwise wonderful series. 7.4 stars out of 10.",1,1,0,0,1,1,0

Scam 1992: The Harshad Mehta Story,"In the recently started rat race of the OTT platforms in India, Sony Liv has so far been lagging behind. But with one show they have now left behind all the competitors. At least for this festive session when viewership traditionally remains higher than average. Scam 1992: The Harshad Mehta Story is undoubtedly one of the finest biopics ever made in India. Based on the fraudster ( or a maverick genius?) Harshad Mehta's life as depicted in Sucheta Dalal and Debasish Basu's bestselling book 'The Scam', 'Scam 1992' is yet another earthen, gripping and thought provoking work by the Director Hansal Mehta of 'Aligarh', 'Shahid' or 'Omerta' fame.Set in the late 70s , 80s and early 90s, the show steals your attention with its first scene. The moments from the past have been so magically recreated that you feel like you are time travelling to those years. Even though plenty of CGI effects have been used, the creators have mixed those with such panache and ease that you don't feel repulsed even for a single moment.Each and every dialogue is intelligent and has a strong punch underneath. I was wondering how they could maintain such consistence in writing the dialogues from beginning to the end, after ten almost forty minutes episodes. Unlike other cheap shows available online, there has never been any attempt to make the dialogues mushy or melodramatic. The dialogues as I found form the soul of this beautifully crafted show.Many will shy away from it thinking its a lexicon of jargons commonly used in the stock market. But hey, you are making a big mistake. You won't even be wrong to take it as your first basic and genuine guide to the stock market. Almost every phenomenon, event, activity of the share market has been thoroughly and lucidly explained by the director, so much so that even if you do not possess any interest in the stock market, you may end up dabbling there to try your luck once you finish watching this series. The creator was not in a rush to finish the things. And that has given him the liberty to show every minute detail of Harshad Mehta's struggling period, his meteoric rise to glory and eventually the disgraceful end. The journey is long but not for a single moment it appears exhausting. The unemotional approach to depict Harshad's life is the forte of the series and the creator does his job with élan. At times Harshad appears very much vulnerable, at times he is emotional, at times he is crooked. But throughout, he is one of his own kind. The non judgmental tone of the director to portray the Big Bull of Bombay Stock Exchange leaves it up to you to make your own image of him- a genius or a monster.The show is bold in its depiction of the contemporary political scenario of India albeit without any distinct desire to appear partisan to any ideology, very much banal these days in the age of sycophancy. Harshad's connections with the New Delhi power corridors show the true color of Indian politics. Use the one with power and dump him when he runs out of gas.Now coming to the best part of the series, acting. Pratik Gandhi as the talented Mr.Mehta has done a fantastic job so much so that I was wondering why Bollywood has such a powerhouse performer so far. A product of Indian theatre activism, Gandhi is phenomenal in his portrayal of such a complex character. He has the potentials to reach the league of extraordinary gentlemen like the stalwarts Guru Dutt, Nasiruddin Shah, Om Puri or Irrfan Khan. He is so much vocal even when he is not uttering a single word. He is expressive even when he has the least of the scopes to emote. He is monumental in his depiction of Harshad Mehta. The other actors like Shreya Dhanwanthary, Satish Kaushik, Rajat Kapoor, Sharib Hashmi- everyone does justice to their roles. Watthour an iota of doubt, you can watch Scam 1992 just for the brilliance of its lead actors.The final verdict- Scam 1992 is an honest and earnest effort from Hansal Mehta to depict the scamster whose name sounds almost like his own- Harshad Mehta. There are no ostentations to glorify the first real superstar or supervillain of the Indian stock market. What he does is perfect portrayal of a decade and a half in the bygone era of the Indian money market which strongly needed a megalomaniac like Harshad to expose the inherent weaknesses of the Indian financial system. Scam 1992 is a victory for everyone associated with its creation.",1,1,0,1,0,1,0
Scam 1992: The Harshad Mehta Story,"The web series tells that Harshad's journey starts like an ordinary youth, whose father's Clothes business collapses.The lower-middle-class family gets caught in financial difficulties. Harshad Dreams are big right now he worked from clergy to support the family to sell goods on the streets.He turns to the stock market and jumps at the speed of a cheetah. But a setback brings him and the family back on the road.Director Hansal Mehta and his authors, Sumit Purohit, Vaibhav Vishal, and Karan Vyas, had done considerable research into the script, and this reflects well in the series.Being a stock-market virgin, a few words fall down every now and then, bouncing on my head. But the author has kept it as simple as possible, clarifying the story with some excellent dialogues.Hansal Mehta tries his best to keep the story as possible, even if we know the end. By the end, the story starts from economic to political but the detailing is quite spectacular!The most talented symbol in the picture is Pratik Gandhi. A popular Gujarati actor, in Scam 1998, he is honored to be at the center of the spotlight, seeing a scintillating performance.As Harshad Mehta, actor Prateik Gandhi remains rigid in character. There is no attempt to make the scamster heroic. Nor does the performance point fingers at the character's misdeeds.Among the supporting cast, Shreya Dhanvantari has more opportunity to shine in the second part of the series, and she performs well in those parts.Veteran Satish Kaushik leaves a mark, as foul-mouth stockbroker Manu Manek. The rest of the cast, some of the popular Gujarati artists, are very reliable and give excellent performances.Whatever Hansal Mehta has done to open Harshad Mehta's saga reflects any commendable aura, but still retaining the original dignity of a saga that saw the Indian middle class money.Hansal Mehta tries his best to keep the story as possible, even if we know the end.Hansal Mehta's clever direction, Gandhi's brilliant performance and quotable quotes make this Harshad Mehta story adequate.",1,1,0,1,0,1,0

Scam 1992: The Harshad Mehta Story,"Let me start with What's good first.
1. The performance of Pratik Gandhi is great. I saw him first in Gujarati movie Bey Yaar and felt he is a great actor but he isn't that good looking. So Bollywood only gave him supporting character roles. Thanks to OTT platforms underrated actors are getting chances to show their talent to whole India.
2. The dialogues are great. They give you the feel of the 70's masala films of Amitabh Bachchan. Ironically, the series mentions Harshad Mehta as Stock Market's Bachchan so many times that you'll forget counting.
3. The story is good. It is a rags to riches story that Indian audiences loves to watch again and again.
4. The director Hansal Mehta has tried to make a subject like stock market as simple as possible so that the masses don't get bored. This was a good decision.
5. The makers showed the real culprits who got away and the dirty politics behind the Harshad Mehta scam.
6. The music is perfect for the web series.
What's bad:
1. Before the series starts, there is a disclaimer about this being a true story with certain creative liberties taken by the makers. Harshad is actually shown as a good guy who did some bad things and became a scapegoat of dirty politics. I am myself confused who Harshad Mehta was and did he deserve what he got in the end. I actually felt bad for him. Was it whitewashing or not? I don't know. This confusion won't leave you as well.

Star Wars: Rebels,"The Clone Wars' never really hooked me. It was technically impressive, but it never did find a cohesive narrative, and it was saddled with many of the same problems as the prequel trilogy. With 'Rebels', virtually the same creative team manage to channel the spirit of the original trilogy while keeping a tighter focus on character and building a stronger and tighter narrative arc.The core characters are all likable and have good chemistry. The focus does skew a bit to heavily toward Jedi in training Ezra at times; likely an attempt to appeal to kids. But there's plenty of room for the rest of the crew of the Ghost, and together they form a pretty solid team.From a technical standpoint, 'Rebels' is light years ahead of anything on TV today. The ships and environments are almost photo-real, and the action is staged in a bold, cinematic way. Like most computer rendered animation, the character models are a bit wonky at times, but here too 'Rebels' shows improvement over its predecessor.Not every episode of its first season is a winner, but neither are there any clunkers, and a few come very close to being great. Hopefully the best is yet to come from this promising entry in the ever expanding Star Wars mythos.",1,0,0,0,0,0,1
Star Wars: Rebels,"I have just finished the second season of star wars rebels and it is great just like the first season. The premise of this season sees the crew of the ghost trying to help form the rebel alliance while on the run from the inquisitors and Darth vader. The character of ezra Bridger is really well developed this season, his journey is the best part of the season. I like the character because he has humour and allot of depth to him especially for a supposed kids show. Kanan, his jedi teacher is also an interesting character as his journey develops really well over the season and I like the interaction between ezra and him. All the other crew is still great as well such as zeb and hera. Also the returning characters were a great addition to. The main story of the birth of the rebellion is really interesting. But the show really does feel a bit dragged out at times with filler. But the last two episodes remind you why the show is great. The script has allot of well placed humour and a more serious dramatic feel then the first season that really works. The style is good with all the action scenes flowing really well, plus the slightly darker tone is very interesting. But there is some filler as I mentioned before that overall hinders the pacing of the show. Overall this is a great second season to a show that is progressing really well.",1,0,1,0,0,0,0
Star Wars: Rebels,"Yes, i accept this show is for kids and at times that really comes across but as a huge Star Wars fan i feel like this show does a really good job of giving us the fans some added context and interesting stories that broaden the universe. The premise of season 3 sees the crew of the Ghost attempt to lead the rebellion to victory over the empire while avoiding a new calculating adversary. Ezra Bridger has always been the main character on this show and i thought this season developed his character very well. After the events of lasts season he is torn between the light and dark side of the force and i thought they matured him alot this season to change him from annoying child to complicated leader. Freddie Prinze Jnr reprises his role as kanan jarrus and after last season's finale he has to go through changes this season that also develop his character and his relationship with Ezra as time goes on. The rest of the crew, Hera, sabine, chooper and zeb all have stand out moments, i especially liked sabine's story over the season that interested me alot. There is two main villains this season on the show first after his return at the end of last season Maul is a lingering threat on this show and his story was fascinating to watch as it resolved itself in a way that was hugely satisfying. The main villain though is Grand Admiral Thrawn and he is a great antagonist, he is always one step ahead of our heroes an he is just such an interesting complex villain that brings out a different side of the empire. The story is set in a really interesting time period in Star wars history as it sees the slow formation of the rebel alliance and i found different aspects of this story really interesting as these people come together to fight the empire, an entity that sees interesting subplots amongst themselves. The script being based for kids has some very childish but some of it can be charming and funny. to be honest the drama does work for this show and it is definitely darker then your average kids show which i appreciate. The style of the show is grander this year with more big battles and it really works to raise the scale and get you closer to the vents of Rogue one. But the pacing of this show is a bit off, I feel like there is a few filler episodes that could have been removed and improve the overall quality of the show. Overall this is the best season of this show and with it confirmed to be reaching its final season i'n hoping it gets even better.",1,0,1,0,0,0,0

Okay, this show isn't as adventurous or action-packed as Star Wars the clone wars was, however, this show does have funny humour and some serious moments. I even like the fact that the voice of the clones Dee Bradley Baker voiced Ezra's dad and even came back as Rex.But the only reason I saw this show was to see after matters of clone wars. However, the haters are right to be angry that Star Wars the clone wars got cancelled for this and I actually agree with them. And I have to admit the relationship between Cannan and Ezra kinda reminds me of Anakin and Obi-Wan. In my opinion, this show is helpful for after matters of Star Wars the clone wars but not as good as the clone wars and it is way too much of a lighter approach. Like I said on my Forces of Destiny review, Disney made a mistake by buying Star Wars and making it into a playground at least Tron Evolution wasn't like this at all.

Star Wars: Rebels,"Star Wars Rebels has turned out a welcoming change of scenery from The Clone Wars, and it's very watchable though sometimes a flawed gem of a show. Some of the stories in the first season alone make these chapters worthy additions to the Star Wars canon, and you can forgive the reliance on The Prequel Trilogy backstory used here, because it uses those references for some satisfying payoffs in the end. Oh, and NO JarJar Binks! *Phew*Star Wars Rebels is a charming and pretty serial to look at and behold, and episodes like Rise of the Old Masters give this series real teeth and personality; it's not afraid to tackle themes that would otherwise be too much for a children's show. It's a brave show that knows when to play it safe, and when not to play it too safe if it compromises the story. Another stand out episode is Path of the Jedi, which follows some of the beats seen in 'The Empire Strikes Back': confronting your fear, the force and preparing yourself for what seems to be the inevitable. The series does borrow from the source movies, but it stands its own ground, and some of these play like entertaining apologies for The Prequels.Disney has done rather well with redefining Star Wars in the 2010s thus far, and Star Wars Rebels along with The Force Awakens show they know exactly what they're doing, and they're bringing back the 'wow' in Star Wars at long last.",1,0,1,0,0,0,0

Star Wars: Rebels,"Unlike many of you reading this, I didn't grow up watching the Clone Wars TV series, and got into this series by accident.

The failing of the recent third trilogy means that it all needs a reboot, and shows like this one help. We have a wonderful motely crew of characters in their own rebellion around the time after Episode III, centring on the master/pupil relationship of two characters, which really is more father/son, more so even than in the movies.I liked the characters, and that the whole show matured from the start with the viewers. The stories initially are very childish fun & humorous but to my personal surprise the stories turned harsher and more aggressive. All for children and they will love it! Why not? Kids are more able to handle mature themes than some realise (I loved Battle of the Planets when I was a kid), and this shows them respect.The show is colourful, humorous and thoughtful.

Star Wars: Rebels,"I have been a fan of the Star Wars Franchise since I was 5 back in 1977, when I Saw Star Wars-ANH. Now in my forties that love grown into the animated series's like The Clone Wars; and Star Wars Rebels. first there was the short lived series The Clone Wars of the early 2000's which I truly enjoyed; but was canceled. It was shocking, because the animated series was so much better than than Pre-quels. IIn 2014 I was excited when I found out the Disney XD channel released Star Wars- Rebels. The series ran from 2014-2018. I was also shocked when season four was the series finale. Just like with the success of The Clone Wars, Rebels gets pulled too soon.This is a great series, especially for those who are the 1st generation Star Wars fans.I can see why some do not like the series, but this is also for new fans ( Kids)as well.It introduces new characters like Zeb(Steve Blum) who is a Lasat. Lasat' are similar to Wookies. The Inquisitor(Jason Isaccs) is a Pau'an who turned to the dark side. Pau'an's come from the planet Utapain( Revenge of the Sith). If you seen the pre-quels you know what I'm talking about. Also new to the saga is Agent Kallus( David Oyelowo) an Imperial. As the series goes along new characters emerge. It wouldn't be Star Wars if you shelved those classic characters. Those that play a big role are Darth Vader, Obi-Wan, Lando, Tarkin, the Wookies, and those classic droids and Stormtroopers to name a few.Star Wars- Rebels follows Ezra Bridger( Taylor Gray) who is an orphan from the planet Lothal. Lothal is a planet a lot like Tatoonie. There are a lot of Moisture Farms, Spaceports, and various species from all over the galaxy. Ezra team up with the crew of The Ghost. They are a small band of Rebels fighting The Empire. Ezra gets imvolved with them trying to flee from TIE Fighters, and Kanan (Freedie Prince Jr.) helps him aboard the Ghost. The crew includes Kanan , an experienced Jedi, Sabine( Tia Sircar) a Mandalorian, Jeb( Steve Blum), Hera the owner of the Ghost( Vanessa Marshall) a Twi'lek ; and their trouble making Astro-Mech Droid C1-10P)-(Dave Filoni). All have teamed up together because either their home worlds were destroyed or taken over by the Empire.
Now Ezra knows is stay with the crew is a temporary time, but really doesn't have a reason to return to Lothal. While he is aboard he does get involved in a few adventures. At first he doesn't want to, but listens to the advise from Hera, and does whats right. Then he really starts to bond with them when he see Kanan in action with his lightsabre. Kanan knows there is something special with Ezra, but Ezra has to learn patience first. Kanan knows that Ezra has a purpose; and can be a valuable asset to them only if he has the proper training.When Ezra gets taken Hostage by the Empire, he knows his only chance is to escape. Thinking his temporary friends will not return for him he outsmarts 2 stormtroopers and escapes through interior of the ship taking a trooper helmet. When he hears communication that the crew has come back for him he is shocked. They rescue him, but now it is time to return home.He know he has bonded with all of them especially after they did rescue him, and does want to leave. Before returning home he devises a scheme and hopefully it will work. When they land on Lothal, as Ezra leaves he swipes Kanan's Lightsabre; and returns to his place. He is unaware the Kanan is right behind him and at his front door. Kanan makes him an offer, he can keep the Lightsabre for a souvenir or come with him and learn more about the force. When Ezra hears this, he accepts Kanan's offer. He is now a Padwan learner and a Jedi he will become. This is a great series with excellent animation and every episode delivers a TKO.",1,0,0,0,0,0,1

In time ""Clone Wars"" improved, and that was OK, I did not mind sticking around for the growth process, as it featured characters I knew and cared for, a narrative that was engaging even though familiar, so it was worth investing time in.I cannot say I feel the same way about ""Rebels"", aside from the short appearance of Obi-Wan, who also seems to have gotten the Disney treatment and now looks about as bland and uninteresting as possible, the rest of the pilot episode was a mish-mash of up and down ideas and concepts that are supposed to plant the future development of this series...and guess what, didn't care one bit about any of it!The animation is sub-par, even when compared to early ""Clone Wars"" episodes, and as a reminder ""Clone Wars"" started back in 2008, you would think that in the intervening years they would have upped their game enough to have done a better job on ""Rebels"".On top of that, 'Rebels"" is populated by characters I don't find interesting at all, they are products of a studio that knows how to approximate variety and inclusiveness without actually doing it, and mimic substance without actually delivering any. The characters clearly have little resemblance to any of those we grew up with or came to love. They are entirely a Disney construct and as such are bereft of any interesting characteristics, flaws or any other elements of their personalities that would have made them more relatable.Typically, as with many other Disney creations, ""Star Wars: Rebels"" is a sugary construct, devoid of any calories or nutrients. It very much resembles fast food, in that it seems to look good at first glance, but once consumed it only leads to an upset stomach and heart burn!The show might well grow and evolve, it is just that as a viewer and Star Wars fan I won't stick around for it, nor am I interested in investing any time in it.I shudder to think what this means for the next batch of Star Wars movies...Much like the times of the evil Empire's triumph over the Old Republic, the Disney era has truly began for ""Star Wars""...5 out of 10EDIT: March, 2015Well, in spite of initially not wanting to invest any time in ""Star Wars: Rebels"", in the end I decided to try and give it a fair shake, and stuck around for the entire season. None of subsequent episodes I watched, were during their original time slot, instead I kind of caught up with them OnDemand. Bad news, watching the entire season did nothing to change my opinion of it.So in spite of having seen the entire first season of ""Rebels"", I still don't like the show, actually I like it even less. The same sanitized, stilted and infantilized attitude, as per Disney's formula of do's and don't's, prevails. The characters are still as one- dimensional, boring, empty and superficial as ever. The technical aspects of the show, still have not improved, despite its scope growing somewhat. Its reliance on ""shoking reveals"" and ""guest character of the week"" is an old and tired shtick. My original review stands as is the 5 out of 10 rating.Let's hope that the rest of the upcoming Star Wars projects are much, much better than this...May the Force be with us all!EDIT: February, 2016Well I've pretty much given up on the show for a while now. I've caught a few glimpses of some episodes here and there. It is still as mediocre and mind-numbingly jarring and boring as before...and judging by ""The New Hope 2.0""...sorry ""The Force Awakens"", is it any wonder?!",-1,-999,-999,-999,-999,-999,-1
Star Wars: Rebels,"After binging season 1 of Rebels, I again did it again for all episodes of season 2 expect for the last few weeks of it. I really loved season 1 and I can easily say that season 2 topped it again. I am writing this straight after watching the 2 part season finale of season 2, so this review is going to be about season 2 as a whole but a lot about the finale, seeing as most of the season was building to the end.I can say, again, I loved this season. For me, Rebels is the story of Ezra and his internal fight between the light and the dark side. I said at the end of season 1 that I really thought that the story of Ezra is what the story of Anakin should have been. I feel as though they really grasped that again this season and I thought it was amazing. Throughout the season we saw him become so much stronger. We got to see him actually fight the Inquisitors, without needing Kanan to do the fighting for him. I really loved the episode where Ezra connected with the Space Whales. I can't quiet remember their names but it really reminded me of young Anakin. Anakin as a pad- wan was what Ezra is displayed now, reckless but caring, and I really am loving how throughout the season we have seen Ezra embrace his own instinct and beginning to trust himself. Now after the season finale and what we can assume is the blindness of Kanan, season 3 is really going to test Ezra's maturity as he is basically the most powerful person the rebels currently have. I'm really interested to see how Ezra is going to be handled through season 3 now that he has these responsibilities as well as his ongoing fight within himself against the dark side.A new introduction to this season, was the return of Ashoka. I really enjoyed Ashoka during the Clone Wars series, especially towards the end as she matured more and more. I really like how her maturity was translated into Rebels. In this season, Ashoka really took a backseat, as Kanan and Ezra was the main focus. But I really liked how as the season progressed, her present became stronger until she was in main focus with Kanan and Ezra for the final episode.I can't talk about this season without talking about the fight between Ashoka and Vader. From the start, when we were introduced to Vader within Rebels, a Vader and Ashoka fight was always on the cards, and when it finally came, it was amazing. This was a fight that wasn't just built up over this season, but from episode 1 of Clone Wars. The Master vs the Apprentice. When they final met, there was an emotion that could not be achieved in any other way than it was by being fleshed out over multiple seasons and series. By far my favourite moment of the whole fight was when Ashoka slashed Vader's helmet and we got to see the actual face of Anakin and hear his Clone Wars voice. At that moment we saw the connection between Ashoka and Anakin. It reminded me so much of the final moments between Ashoka and Anakin in the Clone Wars, which evidently was the last time they saw each other pre-Vader. I really loved how Anakin maintained himself as Vader, still wanting to end Ashoka. For me this was the Vader we should of had in Episode 3. A Vader that was still the Anakin we knew and had seen him transform into the mechanical Vader. I really loved the ending to this fight where we see Vader leaving the temple and Ashoka walk deeper into it. While it isn't clear if Ashoka is actually alive or not, it was interesting to see them essentially go their separate ways.Of course the reintroduction of Maul was again fantastic. He was one of my favourite parts of Episode 1 and again was great in Clone Wars. So when I found out he was going to feature in Rebels, I got really excited. And he didn't disappoint. I loved how he is kind of the more dark version of Ashoka, where he is not a Sith but more of a defect. With that I thought how they made his manipulate Ezra and really introduce him to the dark side of the force. I thought it was fantastic how Maul acted as the catalysis to exposing Ezra to the dark side. It gave him a really important role and I hope he is going to be a big part of the following seasons. Also, the music when Maul was fighting, perfect. Duel of Fates is probably one of the best pieces of scores and it really excited me when it came on.This season was fantastic. The growth of Ezra has been fantastic as we see him mature into a Jedi as well as continue his fight against the pull of the dark side. His fight against the dark side is really going to become interesting now that Ezra has unlocked the Sith holocron. I'm really excited to see where this is going to head next season especially the events of the final episode.9/10",1,0,0,0,1,0,0
Star Wars: Rebels,"I think I didn't watch this show immediately because I was under the assumption that it more targeted towards children. It is but is also for the older fans too.It's really good to be back in the universe again, hearing the music again, seeing characters from the movies and even having some of them voice by the same actors!The characters take some time to get used to, even at the end of season one, you still don't actually know a lot about them. The droid, Chopper, is definitely the most entertaining of the crew, which is something considering it doesn't speak!The effects are awesome except for the wookies, there is no real definition on the hair so it's just one blob and almost looks like lego pieces placed together.This is something I will watch again, mainly just having something in the background but I will be watching Season Two as well.******* SEASON TWO*************I love this show! Being in this universe with the characters, new and old, the planets and the music.You learn more about the characters in this season but I also like the throughout the season, different characters take the focus of episodes so you aren't always seeing the same ones and getting more of their story over someone else.Like Season One, Chopper, is the stand out for me. Who would think a character who can't speak would be so entertaining but through characteristic beeps and hand gestures, they gave him show stealing personality!Be sure the check out the 18th episode - 'The Forgotten Droid' - it's the best episode of the series!You do get to see some Star Wars characters from the movies, like Princess Leia, Yoda and Darth Vader, with an added bonus that the actors that played them return to voice their character. This season also includes voices talents like Sarah Michelle Gellar and Gina Torres.There are some moments in the show that, when it's possible, the two Jedi seem to conveniently forget that they have force powers.It may air on Disney XD but it manages to be a show for both kids and adults, sometimes though some scenes seem to be more adult.

Star Wars: Rebels,"Season One (2014) There's a familial heart to this first season which makes it immediately appealing, centering on building a strong foundation in the relationships of our main cast and giving us an idea how tightly knit they would become over the series. The first season flounders a little when it comes to properly conveying the threat of the Empire, a flaw which is rectified very efficiently by the arrival of Grand Moff Tarkin; and it builds to a bold and satisfying resolution that lets the audience know that, like Clone Wars before it, Rebels is not afraid to push boundaries and embrace the Darker Side of Star Wars stories.Season Two (2015) Where the first season placed a lot of focus on Kanan and Ezra, the second expands that focus to envelop the entire crew, taking their small weekly victories and allowing the events of the series to greater influence those on a galactic scale. It builds on the familiar and begins to dabble in new and darker ideas, opening the story up to unimaginable levels of potential; and the raw emotion at the heart of the season's climactic finale, an epic confrontation years in the making, gives fans the duel they never knew they wanted and makes them pay for it tenfold in heart-wrenching tension.Season Three (2016) By far the most stylistic and best looking the series has ever been, the third season deals heavily with the consequences of the previous two, moving the story forward and making our heroes pay for every small victory they have achieved. Though a thorough and calculated slow burn to the finale, we are rewarded with some of the most visually stunning sequences in Star Wars animation; building toward a conclusion so rife in tension and nail-biting action as to be worthy of Grand Admiral Thrawn's inclusion to the series.Season Four (2017) The fourth and final season is by far the strongest and most coherent of the series, blending the classically episodic nature of previous seasons into one long continuous story that grows and evolves week on week. But even through a season of some of the best action and most revolutionary additions to the mythology, the heart of the show is still its family of central characters and their powerful bond; forcing them to choose between their allegiances to the Rebellion and their relationships with each other as they face their hardest challenges and most tragic losses ever.",1,0,0,0,0,0,1
Star Wars: Rebels,"Everything about Star Wars Rebels is superior in concept, scripts, production values, and scores. Given it ran its originally planned four seasons, it's also the rare example of a series that was allowed to fully explore its range of expressions and wrap up with a satisfying coda.The only shame of it is that since it appeared on the Disney X network, too many people mistakenly consider it to be a children's series. It certainly has elements that appeal to younger people, but the truth is the themes are very much adult in nature.Season four in particular explored Jedi lore deeper than any of the movies, and even deeper than the longer running Star Wars Clone Wars animation series.Toward the end of the series, the technical achievements in 3D animation reached a high point, and in season four there were times that the line between animation and cartoons became blurred. Much in the way that Pixar toned down the realism to deliberately retain an animation feel, Rebels did the same thing. Most of the time those tones were done for animation value, but sometimes, especially when faces were not shown, the full capabilities of the computer animation were revealed.The final two-part airing in season four not only produced an exceptionally intelligent script, but reached for and achieved an enviable example of how personal sacrifice can achieve a victory for good over evil. The character of Ezra Bridger was taken from selfish boy to selfless Jedi in four seasons, and the journey was quite enjoyable. The series finale was exceptional in its depth and message of hope.Dave Filoni and his team produced something truly special with Rebels, and anyone who hasn't already seen it, should be sure to do so soonest.",1,0,1,0,0,0,1

Unfortunately, there is nothing remarkable at all about this new series. It is essentially a repackaging of now-cliché'd Star Wars action sequences and musical scores. What remains are a bunch of uninteresting characters and juvenile dialogue.This isn't creative, it's just more corporate exploitation of a franchise which has already been exploited to death.Please, give us something new instead of re-purposing someone else's creative ideas for easy money.

Star Wars: Rebels,"First of all the target audience of ""Rebels"" is slightly younger than ""Clone Wars"" and this aspect leads to less profound themes and an overall lighter tone. But as long as you know that and you can enjoy something intended primarily for children it's not a problem at all. As far as the story I found the first season a bit boring with very few highs. The sedond season in slightly better but it shines in its last two episodes (that are my favourite from the show). The third and the fourth are a little bit more mature and have some interesting things and characters (like Thrawn). The finale was also good and satisfying.
I have two major criticism regarding ""Rebels"":
1) a lot of episodes especially in the first two season felt like a waste of time, not for bad quality but instead because they didn't lead to anything.
2) the animation. It's bad. Except for a few characters (I really liked Vader) it is very bad. And I'm not comparing it to Clone Wars, it's just boring by itself.

Star Wars: Rebels,"For me, as a fan of ""Star Wars"" since childhood, it was a real gift, even a surprise, because I did not expect that I would get to the show.What can I say: the series is ""episode 3.5"" - the plot is located between the ""Sith Place"" and ""New Hope"". In the first series, the creators have saturated the plot with the atmosphere of a ""distant-distant galaxy"". Every now and then, the imperial storm troopers and their commanders step on the screen, and this instantly causes nostalgia for the very first film of 1977. The atmosphere is just as gloomy, the characters are completely new (unlike the animated series ""Clone Wars""), but this should not prevent loyal fans from enjoying a pleasant feeling. In addition, one of our old acquaintances, and possibly even two, has penetrated the premiere series.The protagonist who hates the Empire, the boy Ezra, is an orphan who survives by theft. By the will of fate, he encountered a small group of resistance, which does everything to annoy the despotic Empire. This group is the rudiments of a rebel alliance (in the series the famous symbol of the rebels flashes), and this meeting will forever change the life of Ezra ...The pilot ""Rebels"" is a story about friendship and a difficult choice, as well as about the sense of duty. This is 44 minutes, allowing you to plunge again into a familiar atmosphere (there was especially a musical accompaniment, similar to the creation of maestro John Williams), that already goose bumps are provided. Beautiful, eye-pleasing graphics remained at the same level as in Clone Wars. The action will be enough: chasing motorcycles (by voice acting and by drawing this scene can be called a reference to ""The Return of the Jedi"") and classic skirmishes on blasters, which so likes, which Han Solo trusts. In general, the pilot of the ""Rebel"" turned out to be very sound, memorable, interesting. And most importantly - the desire to watch has arisen after the first series (although in some serials, retraction occurs through several episodes).So I'll watch a new chapter of the ZV on, those more, I've been waiting for her very much. After all, after looking at Clone Wars, I wondered if the dark spot between the III and IV episodes of the saga would illuminate. That's the answer, and he's the most affirmative!

Star Wars: Rebels,"I've seen the whole ""Star Wars: The Clone Wars"" series, all 6 seasons, and it was tremendous, I gave it a 10. When the Clone Wars stopped, I had my hopes up for this Rebels series, but sadly it has not the same (or higher) level. Where in The Clone Wars literary every character was explained, the history been shown, even made up some characters who also could master the force, the origin of the light-sable, and to top it of the genesis of the good and bad sides, the Rebels series just revolves around stealing from the Empire. No matter what angle they start an episode, it always ends up stealing something, pretty boring, my kids even stopped watching after 5 episodes. And where in the old days the top notch hit series ""Robotech"" was more then just another science fiction, it contained hope and bravery and death and life, so did the Clone Wars series, they died, they sacrificed themselves etc. The rebels series is just so dull and revolves around ... nothing. I believe Disney is the reason for this, every series or movie Disney makes is stripped of everyone of the letter mentioned (delicate) emotions to make a mainstream production. I really hope the series will be better the next season and not so shallow.",-1,-999,-999,-999,-999,-999,-999

She challenges her class of new students and part of her approach is to pick five outstanding ones for special work in her practice. One of the students is Karla Souza as Laurel Castillo, she is my favorite, I don't really pay much attention to the others.

How to Get Away with Murder,"""How to Get Away with Murder"" is a new offering from ABC starring Viola Davis as Annalise Keating, a Philadelphia law school professor who divides her time between her professorial duties and her law practice, where she represents some high-profile defendants.Initially, she appears similar to Charles Kingsfield from ""The Paper Chase"", an inscrutable and harsh professor whose purpose in life seemed to be tormenting first-year law students. But Professor Keating's façade is soon penetrated in this show as the plot corkscrews deeper and deeper into the intrigue that is her personal life.Tom Verica plays her husband, Sam Keating, a professor with a shady past.She employs two assistants, Frank and Bonnie, who keep her life organized and on schedule. In addition, she picks a handful of students from her class--through a practical contest--to work in her firm.Besides the moments from the classroom, and the casework done in support of her practice, and the actual courtroom scenes, the show has an over-riding story arc about a murder that somehow involves her prize students. In each episode, the action bounces frequently between the present and flashbacks that develop the characters and the big murder storyline.By the third episode, it is apparent that there are few characters that you might want to consider as a friend, but the mystery of the central plot is intriguing and each new case offers some interesting twists. How much of this show relates to the actual practice of law in the real world? That is debatable. But the central principles of law and the obligatory questions about justice and propriety provide a bedrock upon which this show is built.There are very few moments of levity in ""How to..."" The focus is on the darker side of life, where crime, punishment and passion create drama. It is too early to tell how long this show can remain interesting, but the early episodes entertain.Update 10/24/14: We can now see where this show is going--much deeper into the life of Annalise Keating, a woman who is so much more complex and multi-layered than we originally knew.Update 3/2/15: By the end of the first season, this show is less about law (or justice) and more about winning.

How to Get Away with Murder,"I was hesitant to start watching, as I was afraid that the series would ""absorb"" me in all aspects - direction, plot, performances. And my fears came true, I had to make the time to watch them in succession and within the shortest time-frame as possible. It was all so intense (at times, a bit too much, or I am just accustomed to slow pace in legal dramas), and the performance of Viola Davis was splendid as usual. As for the other cast, it seems that male characters are more elaborate and versatile than female ones, with bigger difference within the gender. Alfred Enoch as Wes Gibbins is apparently the least cynical among the lawyers-to-be...In the plot, at first, the beginning-with-the-end was slightly confusing, but its skillful inclusion inside other, prior events turned out be intriguing - based on the 9 episodes aired so far. In addition, the series contains topics and values not meant for strong conservatives, but hopefully they can be/get over them. If you like suspense with fast changing of events and scenes, and dominating leading performance, then the series is certainly for you.How to Get Away with Murder is another fine example of the recent trend where TV series have become more interesting than movies, as great directors and performers have begun to work on/in them.

There are times when it feels like producers couls lose you but until now they always managed to come up with new plot lines that increase the suspense again and appear realistic enough to not be ridiculous. Even when I agree that a few seasons less would have been no harm, this should still be a role model for many shows because the level of suspense it builds and keeps up is enormous. What in other shows would be a great cliff hanger is here just another turn within an episode.All in all this is definitely worth a watch. It's not the most realistic series ever and emotionally exhausting at times but definitely keeps you thrilled and searching for answers.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
How to Get Away with Murder,"I watched the pilot of ""How to Get Away with Murder"" without knowing anything about the premise or who's in it.It is basically a legal drama with a twist. The protagonist is a law school professor who is also a defense attorney. In her class at the university encourages the students to find original ideas to help with actuals cases of hers. There is also a significant prize. Four of them will be appointed as her new assistants.It's not that simple though. Things go wrong really quick and both the professor and especially her students get in much more trouble than they can handle.The series has a really modern feel. Fast editing, atmospheric music, and good enough acting. The premise is interesting and the show seems intelligent enough to attract the audience.Overall: Recommended",1,1,0,0,1,1,0
How to Get Away with Murder,"OK so take a chill pill legal professionals. I may not be a lawyer but I know what stretching the truth for entertainment value is. I didn't have to go to law school to know that this show is not completely accurate but who cares. It's something new and also very compelling TV. The cast are fantastic and all out for blood. Viola Davis kinda scares the crap out of me in this role and I could totally see her as an intimidating cross-examiner.My one issue with the show is that it feels a little behind it's time. Had it of been released in 2010/2011 with Pretty Little Liars, Revenge & Once Upon A Time then I think it would have been accepted better. Great show poor timing.

How to Get Away with Murder,"Forget the spam reviews, 10/10 is just the rating fans give it to feel good about loving this pretty shallow legal drama. It's everything we knew and sometimes loved about Shonda Rhimes series. Season 1 was a fresh concept, but each seasons got more ridiculous and extremely soap-ish, with all the family/relationship dramas and over the top twists and turns. With some characters backgrounds changing every season, to be more « woke ». It even made watching the show a chore for me. Especially near the end. Too unrealistic, forced and theatrical for me taste. And PC, too PC for its own good, with the usual amount of double standards and what not some viewers eat for breakfast. Not my cup of tea. Also the madness around the main actress « talent » went to such extremes. She was good, but not THAT good. The only things I really liked about the show was the sense of novelty it's first season brought to the genre, some of the cast members and the music selection (very distinctive to the atmosphere of the series and full of hidden gems). Other than that, it's decent enough to be watched (or hate watched because of some regulars and main characters choices/reactions), but not that unforgettable or addictive after a couple of seasons.",-1,1,-999,-999,1,-999,-999

How to Get Away with Murder,"Since the series started 6 years ago, I was always thrilled by it and always looked forward to its new season each year.
It was a habit, a pleasure, I needed to watch my fresh season of the show each year and only half-way through season 6, I realized that it was the final season.It made me sad and emotional as I followed through the episodes. Overall, it was a great season, complex as always, but with more melodramatic touches than usual.
It is my opinion that it could have run for 2-3 more seasons and entertain us way more. It had the great cast, the material and the potential. What really happened, leading to its finish, I will never know.Thank you to all involved for a great ride and for the sensations and emotions that it provided.

How to Get Away with Murder,"I believe that many, many people attach a taboo to this series being it's on ABC et cetera, but man, you do not know what you're missing.I'm not over hyping HTGAWM at all when I say that this series is worthy enough of safely setting aside of some of the great TV series of all time and I'll explain why:
Peter Norwalk is a man that knows his craft. This show produces more conflict in one season than most shows I've watched, forget about EACH episode! Not only that, but he allows the directing to capture all, and there are A LOT, of sub plots going on the side just by letting the camera pause to catch a characters look etc. I'm not sure I'm articulating it properly and doing it justice how Norwalk has countless technical and storytelling devices he incorporates into this show any justice but it's incredibly done and makes for an amazing series that NEVER let's go of your attention!
This is a show that once you start you see it through to the finish that will result in a huge void in your life once you've completed it, a showhole, and appreciate how incredible this series really is on the landscape of all the content available.

How to Get Away with Murder,"Really? This is not a good show.Some people may like it, may enjoy it... it can be entertaining sometimes, but it's far away from being a good show.It all starts from the fact that it is a very bad copy of Damages (2007- 2012) which its first and last season were amazing. Except quality, Murder has all the elements that made Damages a very interesting thing at that time. Put Annalise in Patty's role, divide Ellen Parsons into peaces then you have Annalise's five protégées. Maintain a main crime as a background element on the story, put some personal dramas and... boom. Even the flashback and flashfoward storytelling is the same.But in Murder the quality is very poor. A classic ABC pattern to attract as much audience as they can. It's a very adult story, but constructed to attract young adults around the globe when filling the show with young actors, superficial story, dynamic edition, sex and modern pop music. By the way, the soundtrack is very invasive, playing all the time to distract people of flaws.Annalise is a very interesting character, and Viola knows how to do it perfectly, but the actress is bigger than the show and sometimes seems that she is misplaced there because everything else does not have the same level of quality. Also, the character development may seems frustrating and sometimes you cannot believe that she is crying in the corner/bed/table/dark again. And it gets boring because every time she turns, her eyes are red and teared and then you think ""HERE SHE GOES AGAIN"". Get over it, Annalise!Then you have the story itself, which is one of the worst things.A bunch of future criminal lawyers face a self defense crime scene. 5 people that would have problems to testify that but they could surely prove their innocence during 13 episodes. But instead, they prefer burn the body, rip it into peaces and trash it, and from a self defense crime, it comes to be a nonsense premeditated murder scene. That is insanely awful. Then you have Annalise that freaks out when she discovers that her husband was having an affair. She judges his moral attitudes forgetting that in the very first episode she was having an affair too. Then she suffers with the loss of her husband, but she also decides to help the five students.The entire development is so poor and confusing that it's hard to believe that people are claiming it an amazing show. If you watch Damages you can check that even its worst seasons can be better than Murder.",-1,-999,-1,-999,-1,-999,-999

Wes is annoying (sorry), and so is Connor's boyfriend. Story is fast-paced and always interesting, and there's always a surprising twist in every episode. The thing is, it did not bore me.

Sylvie's Love,"Greetings again from the darkness. For those who enjoy an old fashioned Hollywood romance, with set design and costumes taking priority over the intricacies of a story, then writer-director Eugene Ashe has the cure for what ails you. In contrast to the numerous films this year addressing topics of socially-conscious issues, this is an unapologetic, soapy, melodrama with beautiful actors and some cool jazz.Tessa Thompson (CREED, 2015; AVENGERS: ENDGAME, 2019) stars as Sylvie, a young woman working in her daddy's (Lance Riddick) Harlem record store while her fiancé is off fighting in the war. Her co-star is Nnamdi Asomugha (a 10 year NFL career, mostly with the Raiders) as Robert, a saxophone player in the Dickie Brewster Quartet. They have their 'meet-cute' moment, and despite the fiancé and Sylvie's career aspirations of being a TV producer, they fall in love. The chemistry between Sylvie and Robert works because Ms. Thompson can light up the screen with her smile.Director Ashe starts the movie in 1962 as Sylvie and Robert bump into each other by mere chance. It's then that we flashback 5 years to their first meeting in the record shop. It doesn't take long to establish that Sylvie is an expert on music and television, and has an independent streak that would be considered unusual for the era. As the two fall in love and appear well-matched, Robert's group lands a prestigious gig in Paris. Just like that, the relationship is over.Falling in and out of love over many years isn't the right description for what happens to Sylvie and Robert. No, they are always in love (whether together or apart) ... it's just that life happens, and timing can be cruel in such matters. Additional supporting performances include Jemima Kirke as the Countess and Robert's agent, a character based on Baroness Pannonica de Koenigswarter; Wendi McLendon-Covey as Lucy, a TV actor on a cooking show; Erica Gimpel as Sylvie's appearances-obsessed mother; Eva Longoria as Carmen, replete with a New Year's Eve song and dance routine; John Magaro as a music producer; and Alamo Miller as Lacy, Sylvie's fiancé and husband. Despite her limited screen time, Aja Naomi King is a standout as Sylvie's friend and party-girl-turned Civil Rights Activist. Her character is one of the few that gives any indication of what's happening socially in the country at that time.It's a film that fully embraces the melodrama - a predictable love story, contrived to the point that Sylvie keeps a secret so personal that we would ordinarily find her despicable; yet in this film, her actions are presented as compassionate. Mr. Ashe's film is a soap opera that looks fantastic, while glossing over the real challenges faced by blacks in the era. It's truly a throwback in style, era, and substance. The people are beautiful. The cars are shiny. The music is hypnotic. Production design by Mayne Berke and Costumes by Phoenix Mellow add to the elegance presented by Ms. Thompson and Mr. Asomugha. You surely know if this is your type of movie. See you later alligator.

Sylvie's Love,"Harlem in 1957 encapsulates the societal and musical changes that had been coming on since the '20's: Jazz must cede center stage to rock, and people of color must strive to become the heroes of their own stories. Sylvie's Love is a pleasant romantic melodrama that itself captures the demands of changing times for those two worlds.Although the film embraces the old cliches to further its formula, Sylvie (Tessa Thompson) is a new woman of color, gladly leaving her father's record shop to become an assistant on a TV cooking show while still open to love, most prominently Robert (Nnamdi Asomugha), an aspiring sax player. Although tensions arise from two ambitious lovers is stock stuff in these dramas, Sylvie's Love has an authenticity that elevates the romance into effective drama, partly because writer/director Eugene Ashe guides Thompson and Asomugha to play their characters in the lower register-fewer tantrums, more realistic sensibility.In fact, so modern is this throw-back romance that the relationship between Sylvie and Robert centers more on what they will do with their lives than on the outcome of their passion. While she struggles with leaving her dream job as a producer (a position rarely ever awarded a black woman at the time) or following his dream to play and eventually lead a combo.The modern sensibility here is Black, Latinx folk finally getting the chance to equal their white counterparts, and they are faced with the same career decisions modern white couples face in moving on to career success. So, while the film offers up little in new sensibility, it does bring us to date on the enduring struggles for minorities in the good ol' US.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Sylvie's Love,"I can understand why some people won't like this film. It's not typical Hollywood. And for a while, I wasn't even sure why I kept watching. And then it came to me. This was like watching real people in real lives.Who the heck is Nnamdi Asomugha? Heck...I can't even pronounce his name! But then again, I'm not a football fan. The man has an interesting real life story. But I'm impressed. He plays this part ""real"", and probably understated. I think that's why I liked his performance. I look forward to seeing him in other things. He's an up-and comer.I guess I should be familiar with Tessa Thompson. I'm rather sure I've seen her in other things...but this time I noticed her. Again, she played this character ""real"".The film is a bit slow. Not tedious. Just ""real"". I questioned a bit the lack of the color line that did exist in America during much of the film. But, that's okay, because that wasn't the point of the film. I think there were opportunities missed -- such as almost leaving out the tension within the jazz combo. But that's okay, because that would have distracted from the love story.I was a bit disappointed to not see a little more ofRegé-Jean Page as a member of the combo...he's another up-and-comer...but that would have distracted from the main story line. Eva Longoria is interesting as Carmen, although it is not a major part.They did a nice job dating the story as it went along through the use of pop music.I struggled here between a ""7"" and an ""8"", and settled on an ""8"" because this film felt ""real"".

Sylvie's Love,"""Sylvie's Love"" is a lovely film. It was actually shot on 16mm film. Even though it's inevitably digitally transferred in the process to my viewing it, I appreciate the old-fashioned look of it. How the soft focus of backgrounds are different, the colors, how you can still tell the difference when apparent archival 16mm footage is spliced in during a road trip, I even like the white-speckled ""sparkles"" from the printing process that momentarily flash on the screen. It's not only that I miss when films were actually made on film that recommends ""Sylvie's Love,"" though; it's that the media of the movie is felicitous with the entire style of the picture, and that it functions within the nostalgic narrative. It's not merely a film made to look like a film from the past, from the 1950s and 1960s in this case, either. It's a shame this will receive less attention than the digital film ""Mank,"" another 2020 movie made to look old-timey, but where mere pastiche is the end aim (fittingly, the ahistorical narrative of that movie bowdlerizes the past just the same).Besides that 35mm was the mainstream format, most obviously ""Sylvie's Love"" is different because African-American romances such as ""Sylvie's Love"" weren't made by Hollywood back then. Sure, Sidney Poitier was a star, but he tended to appear in social-problem pictures oriented towards and made by white men. Black directors like Gordon Parks didn't begin to appear in Tinseltown until the end of the 1960s. It's also a shame if ""Sylvie's Love"" receives less attention because it may seem as though its subject is of less importance than those old chestnuts of social-problem pictures and those of grand events and biographies. In a sense, it's more daring and insightful that that. The Civil Rights movement is on the periphery of the picture, with only one scene that includes racism and even that one is a relatively non-explosive business dinner. No showy, look-how-far-we've-come, self-congratulatory claptrap here, but rather actual screen representation of black stories.And, it's reflexively about the art form itself--about the representation. This is by way of two arts, one that is dying commercially - jazz - and another that is reaching its peak - TV. Fittingly, I streamed ""Sylvie's Love"" on my TV, albeit a widescreen 4K flat screen instead of a fat, squircle cathode-ray-tubed analog boob tube with only a few basic channels. Not quite ""I Love Lucy"" anymore, and I'm not sure who buys vinyl records these days, either, outside of maybe baby boomers and hipsters. Likewise, 16mm film is a dead art form. Thus, we have a film from the past retconned with a story that past films didn't tell. ""The times they are a-changin'"" in more ways than one. Add to this that the story also concerns women's increasing role in the work force and single parenting, as well as a pleasant score and some fine acting led by Tessa Thompson and Nnamdi Asomugha. Like but unlike past and present films, it's of no time--perhaps, even timeless.",1,1,1,0,0,1,0
Sylvie's Love,"I have a lot of negative reviews; not because I dislike a lot of films but 'cause I mainly review films I wanted to like but didn't or just a random review without reason (which is why I have some good reviews.) This one ""I wanted to like."" There's nothing special about this film. It's a regular clichéd romance film reminiscent of the early 2000's. There's no real investment in a character, there's not enough of an emotional quality to any of the characters to really attach yourself to, in my opinion. The flashback in the beginning doesn't even play well because it comes too quick without an establishment of why it's flashing back, you know? So, it's seemingly meaningless in its delivery; and it goes to the present without any real indication that so much time has passed.If one looks closely they can see this is clearly paint-by-numbers. The direction, and the writing. But not really that good of a paint-by-numbers because while it displays all the attributes nothing really seems natural (natural would denote the occasion of coloring outside of the lines.) I did love the beginning (minus the flashback scene, as mentioned above), it had a good feel to it but then it quickly just faltered from there. The clichés were boundless and not even well put together. There's no real dramatic moments (even the horrible secret that the lead female character holds about her daughter which is only a 'secret' to one person -- everyone else knows.) No real comedic moments. No real romantic moments. No real anything.The two best things about the film is the music and the cinematography. Those are the best aspects of the film and if this was a documentary on Jazz/Classic Rock and not a love story, probably would have worked. What I really disliked was that everyone sounded the same. The same voice tones, pitch, vernacular etc., except for the character of Sylvie's father, Lucy and the French guy; but the French guy didn't even sound French even though the actor playing him is French. There's actually a short scene where a white woman mentions how Sylvie's 'husband' sounded 'white' over the phone. While I wouldn't agree with that, I did notice the sameness in most everyone. That's just not realistic of the time period. Of course, many things in this isn't realistic for the time period but the focus is the love story but it failed at that, for me.The worst part: Sylvie does a horrible thing and that's it. No consequence. The last 30 minutes of the film seems to be contrary to how anyone would react to those types of situations; madly in love or not. And the daughter. While some children are in their own worlds this one seemed to be fodder. She was there as a prop not a character. That, in itself, is horrible. Also, this film made it seem as if Jazz was dead in the 60s, hard for Jazz musicians to sell a record. Um, Coltrane's ""Ascension""? Or Miles Davis's ""In a Silent Way""? Or Wayne Shorter's "" Speak No Evil""? Or Nina Simone, Billie Holiday, Louis Armstrong etc., All huge in the 1960s. Apparently in this film Stevie Wonder killed Jazz.",-1,-999,-999,-999,1,-999,1

Or sad and conflicted and confused. But it was all in the same meter. Playing sad and conflicted doesn't mean an actor should play sad and conflicted. That is too easy. The director should have addressed this. It would have helped if the actors were aided by direction that sought out 'sad and conflicted' with choices that weren't so obvious.Anyway... sweet. Gentle.

Sylvie's Love,"It was just weird to watch this. I used to love to watch the old '50s and '60s movies, and since then movies got better -- and worse. The old movies were idealized representations of society (other than whatever the director, writer and/or producer might want to make a point about as a moral to the story). While a lot of the points made were good and valid, it was just so what we used to call ""plastic,"" unrealistic.For a while at least movies since then got more into realism -- though, unfortunately to a fault and to the point of overdoing it. Yet the realism has meant a lot. For instance I loved it when they finally stopped showing women without makeup on during time periods and/or in cultures when they really did not wear makeup (other than the loose women, etc.). Unfortunately, Hollywood seemed more interested in shocking with its ""realism"" than being realistic in very little time.What I see in this film is a strange combination of trying to show what a movie would look like in the '50s or '60s if produced at that time, with just enough realism not to fracture the ""perfect picture of perfect people"" too much.I would also like to add that since so many who celebrate this film call it so sweet and loving -- I have to disagree when it comes to a child in the film who should have gotten a LOT more play in the script. But apparently this ""ideal love"" doesn't really care all that much about children, even those who have been born of their great love. Oh yes -- and that is the other thing that is very different than the old films: it added late 20th and 21st century morals (or lack of them) into the film as if they fit into the time being represented in the film (which was the late '50s or so).I don't want to pick on just this film. I have LOT of films I could pick on -- and I'd rather just not waste my time watching 95% of the movies that are made today. I decided to watch this and am not glad I did. I DO think the actors generally did a good job, the sets and music were nice (and most often too nice). The movie is a mixed bag. I would rather have not seen it.",-1,-999,-999,-999,1,1,-999

Sylvie is a Black woman with big dreams of working in the television industry. Great! I can get into that. Robert is a musician with big dreams of working in the music industry. Great! I can also get into that. What Sylvie's Love gives the audience as a love story just doesn't work well. Where was the conflict that kept these two apart? Nothing even remotely remarkable. Sylvie's fiancé Lacy is away serving the country. She spends a lot of time with Robert, becomes pregnant by Robert, but still marries Lacy anyway, who knows he's not the father. Her husband leaves her. She reconnects with Robert despite her explanation of why she didn't tell him about their child. The sparse storyline just glosses over any adverse effects to the child. The number of break-ups between the two is beyond nauseatingly shallow lack of communication.

Interstellar,"The first 80-90% of ""Interstellar"" I absolutely loved and was prepared to give this movie a 10. Sadly, the ending inexplicably had an ending that didn't make a lot of sense and only seemed there in order to tack on a nice Hollywood ending and wrap everything up perfectly. It's sad, but apparently the public embraced this sort of ending...so who am I to complain?!As for the film, there are a bazillion reviews so I will be brief. The film has incredible special effects and is a film best seen in the movie theater. On a HUGE screen at home, it would still lose something. Like the wonderful ""Gravity"", it just needs the big screen...trust me with this. The story is exceptional and offers many wonderful twists (up until the disappointing ending that is) and there are a lot of wonderful performances. Overall, the good certainly outweighs the bad and it's a film to see. But as for me, an ending with more sadness and vagueness would have been okay.",1,0,1,0,0,0,0
Interstellar,"As someone who likes the cast, loved the concept and who considers Christopher Nolan very talented and has enjoyed a good deal of his films, 'Interstellar' was somewhat of a let-down. It has a lot of great elements, but also has its flaws and one admires Nolan more for his ambition than his execution.Starting with the praises, 'Interstellar' does look spectacular. It's majestically shot, seamlessly edited and boasts audacious set design and fantastic special effects. The music score from Hans Zimmer is perhaps his best effort for a Nolan film, it has subtlety but also an unnerving eeriness and haunting and heart-wrenching pathos. The sound effects and sound mixing are expertly managed and give a real sense of authenticity.'Interstellar' however has more than just being technically spectacular. It is thought-provoking and awe-inspiring frequently, with some fascinating ideas, and does have a lot of heart, making the emotional elements genuinely poignant. The Cooper/Murph relationship, which is really what takes centre stage, is beautifully done and often very heartfelt. Nolan directs with great ambition, strong direction of the actors and flawless technical command.Matthew McConaughey proves that his Best Actor Oscar for 'Dallas Buyers Club' wasn't a fluke, he holds everything together in a committed, charismatic and deeply felt turn. MacKenzie Foy matches him beautifully as does Jessica Chastain. Anne Hathaway is sassy and emotive, and there is fine support from John Lithgow and Michael Caine.However, 'Interstellar' is overlong and, because of the wildly variable pacing and that the story doesn't quite have enough content to justify it, it feels it. The pacing is wildly variable as aforementioned, there are times where it's fine but there's some choppiness and stodginess too.Dialogue isn't a strong suit either, there are many times where it's thought-provoking and poignant, but too much of it also consists of confused and at times illogical science (the time and space stuff was convoluted sometimes), forced sentiment and things being over-explained and preachy. Matt Damon's character felt thrown in and not particularly necessary, also somewhat silly, while the ending is far too idealistic and too falsely pat.Overall, less than stellar and was expecting much better. This said, 'Interstellar' is often impressive and very beautiful (especially technically, though the central relationship was also beautifully realised). 6/10 Bethany Cox",1,1,0,1,1,1,0
Interstellar,"Another outer space film from Hollywood, this time directed by INCEPTION's Christopher Nolan. Thankfully it's better than the overrated GRAVITY, but INTERSTELLAR soon turns out to be overrated in turn. It seems that as soon as a film comes out these days with a half intelligent premise, critics and audiences lap it up and rate it as one of the best ever. INTERSTELLAR is far from that. It has plenty of interesting moments, but the overlong running time is padded and bloated with endless sentimentalism and extraneous characters.It also takes a heck of a lot of time for anything to actually happen. Matthew McConaughey is all earnestness as the protagonist and comes across as a dullard; Anne Hathaway's character is completely extraneous and lacking in charisma. Only old timers like John Lithgow and Michael Caine shine, although Wes Bentley is underutilised in his role. An unexpected appearance from Matt Damon is undoubtedly the story's highlight.For much of the running time this follows the template of a typical space adventure, but around the middle part of the film it starts to get weighed down with endless CGI effects and the whole end part of the production gets muddled and predictable in equal measure, coming across like a rip off of 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY but not nearly as good.",-1,-999,-999,-999,-999,-999,-999
Interstellar,"In the near future, Earth is devastated by blight where corn is the only surviving crop. Joseph Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) is a former astronaut pilot who has turned to farming like everybody else. He and his daughter Murph find an underground NASA site run by Dr. John Brand (Michael Caine). Brand calculates that the blight will wipe out mankind in a generation. He is working on plans to save humanity after wormholes have been discovered leading to other worlds. Coop goes on a mission with Brand's daughter Dr. Amelia Brand (Anne Hathaway), Romilly and Doyle. However the mission runs into problems of relativity and sabotage. Meanwhile Murph (Jessica Chastain) grows up and tries to finish the calculations by Brand.I have problems with the setup to this movie. The idea that everybody needs to turn into farmers seems laughable. There are all kinds of problems with the start. The blight seems to be a catch-all for Nolan to use as a tool to explain away whatever he needs. It's inelegant and clunky. Apparently, science is not necessary anymore in this world. It's not like this dystopian world has run out of oil. A lot of it seems unlikely.Once McConaughey goes up into space, the movie gets better. It has touches of 2001 but generally, it is more like 2010. There are still some problems with unlikely human reactions. The whole conflict between Tom and Murph seems overblown. It's trying to up the drama without setting it up properly. I like McConaughey's side of the story. I would have preferred to stay mostly with him and lose some of Chastain's. I'm afraid the time relativity ideas may be lost on some of the audience. Even the best parts of the movie do have some nagging questions. It is still an awesome movie despite its problems. Although, I thought he might turn into a space baby at the end.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Interstellar,"To this day , many people still talk a lot about Christopher Nolan's ""Batman""-trilogy, but here is his newest work: ""Interstellar"". He gets help from Michael Caine and Anne Hathaway again and a couple more familiar faces. One year after Cuarón with Gravity, he discovers the endless widths of space as well. The difference, however is that a large part of his movie, including the first 40 minutes or so completely, plays down on Planet Earth. However, it is also about survival in space, including two people instead of one though. Or you could probably say the whole human race and not one individual fate.This is like our generation's ""Armageddon"", only that it is much better and much more edge-of-the-seat. The lead character is played by Matthew McConaughey, whose career is still on a massive high after numerous critically lauded performances and an Academy Award win. ""Interstellar"" is much more than Sci-Fi though. I personally found the film was at its best when it touched more the emotional relationships of the characters. The water planet sequence was incredibly well done. And right afterward, when Cooper (McConaughey) sees how his beloved family has aged and become parents, it is truly moving as well. I had a lump in my throat just like I did when he meets his very old daughter at the end of the movie. The inclusions with the old people telling about the past seem a bit odd at first, but make sense towards the end as we find out who is speaking there really.Then, I also had a love-hate relationship with the Matt Damon parts. I found it pretty boring to be honest initially, but when we found out about his true intentions, it quickly turns into one of the best parts of the film. Nicely done. When Caine's character mentioned him with high praise early on, I felt there could be something fishy (like with Pixar's Up) there and yes it was. The ending of the movie with Hathaway's character completely alone out there made me think maybe there will be a sequel. Saving Private... ehh I mean Dr. Brand. Who knows? The time during which the whole film plays is also interesting. Somehow, the NASA lost a lot of their reputation and the moon landing is called fake in American school books. It is some point in the future. That much we know. David Oyelowo plays a small role here as one of the teachers. He has ""Selma"" in the race for an Academy Award nomination this year.The ending of the film was not among the best scenes in my opinion, but I still liked it. The whole ghost explanation about Cooper being actually the one giving the signs was pretty exciting. The effects are brilliant of course, but that does not really need be mentioned for Nolan movies. A given. Hans Zimmer did a good soundtrack and there is also some comic relief coming from McConaughey's charm (if you like that) and some droll robot creatures. Anyway, I found the film interesting enough that I found it a bit sad they did not get to visit the third planet (with Hathaway's character's lover), only the water planet and the ice planet. I'd have loved to see that. However, maybe that could be a nice inclusion for a sequel as well. The movie never dragged despite coming pretty close to the three-hour mark. It could have run for another hour and I probably would not have been bored. There really was hardly anything wrong with it. Affleck's character did not do too much for me. He wasn't particularly well-acted and the character felt just included as a simple man who quickly gave up on his dad in order to show the contrast compared to Chastain's character: the ambitious loving smart daughter with a true connection to Cooper. John Lithgow plays a small role too and is fun to watch as always.This is one of the movies I really recommend to watch, preferably on the big screen due to its sensational visual aspects. It's also good for a rewatch I believe, also to evaluate the characters' actions, especially Caine's for example. And the story of course. I believe, after one viewing, I am still far away from having understood everything that was going on, especially the scientific aspects. That however, does not hurt the viewing experience at all thanks to the film's great acting and emotional impact. If you are interested in space, you really have to see this too. It has distant planets, wormholes, black holes, spaceships and a lot more. Let me finish this review with two little snippets: First, the actress who played Murph as a child was the same that played Renesmee in the last two Twilight movies and, secondly, that fittingly Hathaway's character was called Amelia like the aviation pioneer Amelia Earhart. That can't be coincidence, can it? Especially with her last shot.",1,1,0,0,1,1,0
Interstellar,"I'm treading on some little used ground. From reading previous user comments, it seems that people give this movie a ten or a one (really?!). While this movie is, at times, a little confusing in the implications of time and space, it is still quite challenging and interesting. Earth is dying. Technology and war are blamed for the current conditions. Apparently, because of some serious dust, crops are slowly being destroyed. Also, the dust presents health hazards. The solution is to find a way to get people to a new place...or...to let the chips fall and send a few into space to inhabit a new planet or asteroid or moon or whatever, and start the whole thing over. A group of people who have maintained NASA (which is now seen as the deceivers of mankind) are building ships to explore the possibilities. The problem has to do with a limited time to manage this because of the laws of relativity. I thought it sort of devolved in a kind of sentimental mess, but the presentation of the problem is worth a viewing. There is some preachiness here which I find a bit hard to take, and a couple stated lessons that an eighth grader would know, let alone these experts. But it did keep my interest. One short criticism: It is way too long.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Interstellar,"I'd heard fairly mixed things about this film, and often heard praise for elements that I think one shouldn't lead with, so I did put off seeing it until very recently. The reason for this mixed reaction I guess if that it is a very mixed bag of a film, and I can see why people love it, hate it, and a bit of both. The plot sees a series of unexplained events bringing a farmer and former pilot into a group looking to save humanity from the earth, which is currently killing itself and threatening to take mankind with it. Looking to the stars, in particular a black hole which seems to have been placed nearby to allow for travel to much more distant worlds, he learns of previous missions to scout out other planets on the other side, and that he is needed to lead a mission to follow up the promising leads, leaving his family behind potentially forever.To get it out of the way, there is a lot not to like about the film. It runs very long, and at some points this almost seems deliberate – like it has to be a certain length to be able to be called an epic. It also has variable pacing and plotting across this time, with some elements not making logical sense without even having to nitpick on technical details. However, while it doesn't all come together, the film is no less beautiful for what it does while it is trying to do it all. The visual effects are stunning, with believable space travel and worlds created, to the point that although a lot of it is technobabble, you do tend to go along with it and accept everything being laid out. Just as important as the technical, visionary stuff, is that the film has a very human heart throughout. It is surprisingly emotional, even when in the context of pure sci-fi elements; you do tend to buy characters as people, with their flaws, their pain, their motivations – it is surprising how strong the film is in this regard.Part of this working is that the performances are universally strong, although to just pick one – Mathew McConaughey is really great throughout. His down-to-earth elements bring the viewer into the film, while he completely nails the emotional content, which again helps convince us of the reality of the situation and passage of time – because we see how it hits his character, so it must be real. The director marshals all this in a feast for the eyes, heart, and brain – it doesn't all work, like I say, and it is far from being the perfect, flawless film that some would suggest, but it is engaging, thoughtful, heartfelt, and very well made.",0,1,-999,-999,-999,-999,1
Interstellar,"In a post-apocalyptic future, crop blight is destroying civilization. The former pilot and engineer Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) lives in a farm in the countryside with his teenage son Tom, his daughter Murph and father-in-law Donald (John Lithgow). Murph is convinced that there is a ghost in her room trying to communicate with her and Cooper decodes a message with a coordinate. He heads to the location and finds a hidden NASA facility. Cooper meets Professor Brand (Michael Caine) that explains that they have found a wormhole and sent several spacecraft to seek a planet to send mankind. Only three of them are returning signals and now they want to launch the spacecraft Endurance to recover the collected data. He invites Cooper to be the pilot of Endurance and travel with his daughter Amelia (Anne Hathaway); the scientists Doyle (Wes Bentley) and Romilly (David Gyasi); and the robots TARS and CASE. Cooper accepts and Murph is overwhelmed with his decision. Copper crosses the wormhole to a distant galaxy in the beginning of a dangerous trip to save mankind. ""Interstellar"" is a sci-fi with a pretentious and overrated trip by the Hollywood darling Christopher Nolan. The story has a promising beginning, but becomes totally nonsense in the moment that Cooper leaves Brand. The plot is pretentious and uses Einstein relativity theory and other scientific concepts that are impossible to know whether they have scientific accuracy or not.

Interstellar,"Matthew McConaughey portrays Cooper, a former near astronaut only a daughter (Mackenzie Foy/Jessica Chastain) could love. The Earth is dying from...well it is dying so the government rewrites history books to make the space program fictional, apparently attempting to appease right wing audiences and alienate left wingers...but wait, that's just a bad hook.Based on lines in the dust in the library, Cooper discovers a top secret NASA location near his house (built on ""magnetic ore"" ) in farm country. It seems somebody has deliberately placed a wormhole out in space near Saturn that leads us to another galaxy where there are some earth-like planets...maybe. Yes, in this near future world NASA has been able to solve suspended animation and create a ship to transport people to Saturn and beyond, start colonizing planets and be able to send signals back through the wormhole...but they can't green Mars.Now the science behind it is an extrapolation of what we know and believe theoretically, except for maybe that library scene which I found very very hard to swallow, but it was the climax of the film. It was needed to bring the film full circle. Many people will get lost in the science as they toss around terms. Yes, let's send a robot through the event horizon of the black hole so we can get the missing gravitational data we need to fill the gap in our anti-gravity quantum physics calculation...which we can immediately make into something to transport the human population. I had more problem with the practicality of applying the science then the science itself.They go to one planet landed on by Miller. They called it Miller's planet. Then they go to landed on by Mann, apparently it was a Mann's world too. Not to reveal more than the trailer, The question in the film is about how much would an individual sacrifice to save the species in the future. The underlying question screams about how we are killing the planet for the future, but are not willing to sacrifice anything in carbon emissions now. Yes, the theme of the film touches on the modern debate of Global Warming and the sacrifice asked of us to stop it and save the only planet we will ever live on for generations unborn.What are you willing to do to save the world for generations unborn?Worth while view for the science and Omni crowd...others do so at their own risk.Parental Guide: No sex or nudity. 2 F-bombs for the kids.

I kind of would have loved to have watched this on an IMAX screen, the sheer scope of the whole thing. It's just amazing, what Nolan has put on screen here. It's not only the visual experience (there is no 3D here by the way), it's the story/ride you take with it.

Interstellar,"I saw the poster for this film long before its release, and it was billed to be a big blockbuster, the success of space movie Gravity probably helped the hype, directed by Christopher Nolan (Memento, Insomnia, The Dark Knight, Inception). Basically in the near future Earth is facing the extinction of the human race due to drought, famine and extreme climate change. Widowed former science engineer and NASA pilot Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) runs a farm with his father-in-law Donald (John Lithgow) and lives with teenage son Tom (Timothée Chalamet) and ten year old daughter Murphy ""Murph"" (The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn's Mackenzie Foy), she believes her room is haunted, the ""ghost"" she and Cooper discover is communicating through gravitational waves, leaving binary coordinates in dust. These coordinates direct Cooper to a secret NASA installation led by Professor John Brand (Sir Michael Caine), there may be hope for the human race to survive; a wormhole, created by alien intelligence, discovered in the further reaches of the solar system, leading to another galaxy, surrounding the black hole Gargantua three potentially habitable worlds have been identified, named Miller, Edmunds, and Mann, after scientists who surveyed them. Cooper is recruited to pilot the spacecraft Endurance to explore these planets, if one of them can sustain life then humanity will follow in space stations, but this means he will be away from home for many years, but this mission is important, Murph is devastated by his departure, they part on bad terms. On Endurance, Cooper is joined by Brand's biologist daughter Amelia (Anne Hathaway), scientists Romilly (Cloud Atlas's David Gyasi) and Doyle (American Beauty's Wes Bentley), and robots TARS (voiced by The Grinch's Bill Irwin) and CASE (voiced by Josh Stewart), the scientists go into hibernation while the craft travels towards the black hole, once close they awake and try to withstand the turbulent effects. The first head to planet Miller, but it being so close to Gargantua means it experiences severe gravitational time dilation: every hour on the surface is seven years on Earth, it is inhospitable, being covered by shallow ocean that experiences enormous tidal waves, Amelia tries to recover data, but Doyle is killed and departure is delayed, returning to the shuttle Cooper and Amelia find 23 years has passed. Back on Earth, adult Murph (Zero Dark Thirty's Jessica Chastain) is now a NASA scientist assisting Brand with his equation to enable NASA to launch the massive space station, near death Brand admits he already solved the problem and determined it is an impossible project, he covered this up and put faith in ""Plan B"": using fertilised embryos to start humanity anew, however Murph says the equation could work with additional data from a black hole's singularity. The Endurance only has enough fuel to visit one more planet, after a tense vote they decide Mann is best, however landing they find it is icy and inhospitable, they do however find Dr. Mann (Matt Damon) in hibernation, awoken he tells everything he knows about the mission, he knew ""Plan B"" was the true goal, he faked data to be rescued. In a moment of madness Mann breaks Cooper's spacesuit visor and leaves him to die, fleeing to Endurance on a shuttle, Romilly is killed by a bomb Mann planted, Amelia rescues Cooper and they get to Endurance, just as Mann docks improperly and causes the airlock to explode, serious damage is caused, but Cooper gets Endurance under control using the shuttle. Nearly out of fuel Cooper and Amelia plan to slingshot Endurance around Gargantua towards Edmunds, Cooper sacrifices himself with TARS to collect data on the singularity, detaching into the black hole and propelling Amelia by dropping the ship's mass, Cooper and TARS enter an extra-dimensional ""tesseract"", where time appears as a spatial dimension and portals show glimpses of Murph's childhood bedroom at various times. Cooper realises the alien beings may be human from the future who have constructed this space for him to communicate with Murph and save humanity, the coordinates from previously were in fact Cooper himself, finding adult Murph in the ""tesseract"" he uses gravitational waves to encode TARS's data on the singularity into Murph's watch, with this she solves Brand's equation and the process of evacuating Earth begins, the ""tesseract"" is closed and Cooper ejected from Gargantua back into the Solar System near Saturn. Time dilation from the entire mission means that humans have evolved to become an advanced space faring race, Cooper is found by a space police vehicle before his oxygen level drops, he wakes on-board ""Cooper's Station"", he explores the alternative world, and he reunites with elderly Murph (The Exorcist's Ellen Burstyn) who led the exodus of humanity, she advises Cooper and TARS to search for Amelia, who has begun preparation on the planet Edmunds. Also starring Casey Affleck as adult Tom Cooper, Spider-Man 3's Topher Grace as Getty, The Last King of Scotland's David Oyelowo as School Principal and William Devane as Williams. McConaughey holds it together well as the forthright pilot into space, Hathaway is good being informative, Chastain does well as the angry but important daughter, Damon is a welcome surprise, and Caine gets his moments as the wild old man. The majority of the film has similar scale and vision to 2001: A Space Odyssey, utilising fantastic special effects for spectacular visuals and extra-terrestrial worlds, I can see elements of Silent Running as well, it does get soppy towards the end with a concept like Contact (coincidentally also starring McConaughey), but overall it is a majestic space film with plenty to offer, including heart, a worthwhile science-fiction adventure. It won the Oscar for Best Visual Effects, and it was nominated for Best Music for Hans Zimmer, Best Sound Mixing, Best Sound Editing and Best Production Design, it won the BAFTA for Best Special Visual Effects, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography, Best Original Music and Best Production Design, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Original Score.

Interstellar,"Uh-oh, here I go again. The movie's out, what, a week or so as I write this, and IMDb voters have it ranked the 11th best movie of all time!!?? If there's justice in a rational world this would never happen. But it's not a rational world anymore now, is it, when an MIT professor can be found on tape explaining how the President's signature health care law was built on lies and deceit, and the media isn't even interested in covering the story.I could rant on but what's the point. I guess if you're name is Nolan, any movie that comes out with the director's fingerprints on it will be hailed as monumental. I don't have a beef with Nolan personally, I think he makes some visually fantastic films (this is one to be sure), but most of the time I think the hype precedes the product and then everyone else falls in line singing the praises.Case in point - ""Interstellar"". Nominally a sci-fi thriller, the picture devolves into something of a time travel anomaly that leaves the viewer scratching their head when hero Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) finds himself on the wrong side of the bookshelves in one of the picture's pivotal moments. I'm sitting there thinking 'this is what I came to see the movie for'? I'm not even going to start on Coop's selection to save the planet just by showing up at Professor Brand's (Michael Caine) facility. Which by the way, didn't it start out as some shack in the desert? When we get a tour of the place, it's got NASA central looking like a global conglomerate.Speaking of which, how is it NASA's still around for this massive undertaking to repatriate all of Earth's citizens to another planet? Unless I'm mistaken, NASA's primary goal now is Muslim outreach and all the best and brightest brains have farmed out. My head is starting to hurt.It was a small theater crowd last night, and I usually don't do this, but since a gentleman ahead of me held the door as I filed out, I asked him what he thought of the movie. His exact words were ""That was a piece of excrement"", only he used the more colloquially popular term for excrement. I wouldn't go that far, but if one hour in the wormhole equals seven years of Earth time, you're going to get old real fast trying to understand this picture.",-1,-999,-999,-999,-999,-999,-999
Interstellar,"Set in a future where crop species are going extinct one after another former test pilot Joseph Cooper is now a farmer growing corn. His daughter Murphey thinks there is a ghost in her room; Cooper doesn't believe in ghosts but accepts that something is there when the dust on the floor is a set of coordinates in binary form. He goes to that location and finds himself at a NASA base where he learns of a secret programme to find another habitable world involving a wormhole discovered near Saturn. He is asked to take part in a mission to find the best planet out of three orbiting a black hole; each of which has a scientist who went on a one way mission sending data back. The plan is to find a world to transfer humanity to but if that is impossible there is a back-up plan for the crew to raise the 5000 embryos stored aboard their ship. Time is an issue as it moves at a different rate near the black hole; this means that as hours pass for Cooper years are passing back on Earth.This film starts at a gentle pace gradually explaining what has happened to the Earth before getting the mission to save the world started; this means the separation of Cooper and Murphey is more emotional. Once the mission is underway there is plenty of tension, including some particularly gripping moments on the second planet they visit. The small cast does a fine job; especially Matthew McConaughey, who plays Cooper; Anne Hathaway, who plays Amelia Brand a scientist aboard the mission; and Mackenzie Foy and Jessica Chastain, who play the younger and older Murphey. The effects looked great, as one would expect in a film from Christopher Nolan, and I was pleased that space was depicted as silent; something that is both scientifically correct but also more impressive. Things do get a little confusing near the end but in a way that made me want to watch again rather than causing frustration.Overall I'd recommend this to somebody looking for intelligent science fiction in the mould of '2001 – A Space Odyssey' although this has more emotion to it than that classic.",1,1,0,0,0,1,1
Interstellar,"As directed by Christopher Nolan, he of the pretentious, derivative, mind-bending crap-fest that was Inception and the vastly over-rated Dark Knight trilogy, I fully expected Interstellar to have plot holes you could pilot a space station through—and, with a whopping running time of 169 minutes, I figured staying awake would be a task almost as gargantuan as the film's black hole (which is actually called Gargantua—that's just how gargantuan it is!!!).Sure enough, the preposterous pseudo-scientific plot can be picked apart with ease, but the film itself is something of an anomaly: although it is a grossly indulgent pile of pretentious hooey that stretches plausibility to breaking point, I found myself entertained throughout. Interstellar is so far up itself that it actually transcends all the laws of cinema and proves to be a rather enjoyable piece of big-budget baloney as a result.For starters, we get Matthew McConaughey's farmer Cooper, who is chosen to pilot NASA's only spacecraft, despite having spent the last decade or so growing corn. Then we get two of science-fiction's most aesthetically awkward robots in the form of A.I. units TARS and CASE. After flying through a worm-hole, Cooper lands his spacecraft in several inches of water and then surfs a massive tidal wave. We see a planet so cold that its clouds are solid ice. We have a mad scientist who rants about the human instinct for survival while head butting Cooper with his space helmet. Although Michael Caine's character spans 23 years, he doesn't look a day older than when we first see him (his voice just gets a bit hoarse, but not Batman hoarse). And Cooper enters a black hole where he ends up behind a 5-dimensional bookcase that allows him to manipulate gravity to send a message to his daughter via wristwatch!!!And that's just the stuff I can recall right now (it's waaay past my bed-time and I'm very tired).If only there had been a few ninjas, some gratuitous female nudity (perhaps a race of insatiable, sexy alien maidens with over-sized breasts), a planet of space zombies, and a laser battle, this would have been the perfect so-bad-it's-good movie.7/10: it's too wonderfully silly for me too hate on it as much as I really should.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Interstellar,"I am a Scientist, and I have always been fascinated with travel into space, ever since I looked up in the 1950s with my dad and spotted the Russian Sputnik satellite overhead in the night sky. This movie, ""Interstellar"", is my kind of movie. I saw it at home on Blu-Ray.As one would expect for this type of movie the picture and sound are both superb, and many times the deep, rumbling bass rattled the fireplace grill and the framed posters on my wall. It is long, at 2 hours and 45 minutes to the closing credits, but every minute was attention-grabbing. I will watch it again.The setting is the future, not too distant, and Matthew McConaughey is former Astronaut Cooper, now a corn farmer. Where he lives are recurring giant dust storms, a barometer of how close the planet Earth is to no longer being able to support human life. Everyone is worried but also busy surviving.Cooper also has a bright 10-yr-old daughter and together they make sense of some strange happenings in her bedroom, books falling off the shelves, dust making patterns, they figure out some coordinates that take them to the top secret location of the remaining NASA headquarters. In secret they have been developing a space ship capable of going to the outer reaches of the Solar system to encounter a wormhole, they think put there by intelligent beings, to allow passage into a distant system that may have planets that can support human life. Cooper is needed as pilot for the mission, not knowing if he will ever return to his family.One of the scientists making the trip is Anne Hathaway as Brand, daughter of the old scientist leading the project. Plus several others. There is an intelligent robot with Bill Irwin as the voice of TARS. (As an aside, Irwin had a recurring role on the old TV series 'Northern Exposure' and his presence here brought back fond memories.)So the whole story gets pretty complicated and cannot always follow good science. Still it is extremely well presented, with a totally novel ending. Writer/director Nolan borrows from his ""Inception"" bag of tricks, when every hour on a planet near a black hole is like 7 years back home, so everyone on Earth ages far ahead of the crew. Really, really good movie.SPOILERS: (For my own recollection.) In the end Cooper and his ship are being sucked into a black hole, the ship is being ripped apart, he ejects and, instead of being consumed he ends up in a type of matrix behind the walls and bookshelves of his daughter's room, he can see her, he realizes it was actually him who those years earlier had given her the signals. Forward to a few years later, he is on an orbiting sanctuary, while he contemplates joining Brand now on a new planet trying to colonize it.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Interstellar,"Just watched this on IMAX with my movie theatre-working friend who had seen this before. It has Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway going to space and seeking possible livable planets for places to move the earth people when that planet becomes uninhabitable. Christopher Nolan directs quite a long but mostly intriguing tale of how long this journey lasts and the effect on McConaughey's offspring when they grow up without having him around during those times. I have to admit that part of me was ready to sleep during some scenes but something exciting does always come up and it gets a little better as the narrative keeps on going. So on that note, Interstellar is very much worth seeing if you're patient enough to watch quite a long movie requiring you to think.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Interstellar,"I finally got around to watching ""Interstellar"" after having been told how good and fantastic this movie was by several people. I will agree with them for the most parts. It is a beautiful movie and it has a captivating storyline. Well, right up to the point where Cooper went into the Black hole. Then it just turned ludicrous.However, from the way I had been told about the story in ""Interstellar"" I had expected a bit more from it. I found it to be a bit too brisk in getting past most of the events that took place throughout the course of the movie.The effects in the movie were really good and came off as being believable, which really worked in favor of the movie, obviously. And the acting was also quite good, even with Matt Damon in it.There are some interesting elements in the storyline, I just wish that Nolan would have put more emphasis on the science and theoretical aspects of the movie's storyline; in regards of black holes, wormholes, relativity theory, etc.All in all, an enjoyable movie for sure, but for me it just wasn't as grand and epic as most people had made it out to be.",0,1,1,-999,-999,1,1
Interstellar,"Christopher Nolan directs an enthralling space odyssey, co-written with his brother Jonathan. This movie lives up to the hype and is one not to be missed. The earth is chocking as it is a starving Dirt Bowl. The future is dim as farmers are producing less and less to feed the population. Cooper(Matthew McConaughey)is a former test pilot and widower raising two children, fifteen year old Tom(Timothee Chalamet) and ten year old Murph(Mackenzie Foy), who is suspended from school for fighting. She refuses to believe the school books being right, saying the Apollo missions were faked in order to bankrupt Russia's space program.Cooper and daughter stumble across the remnants of the believed to be defunct NASA, where Professor Brand(Michael Caine) convinces Cooper he is the only one to command a mission to be launched into space in search of a new planet that can sustain life. The flight must enter a wormhole that will warp time, but allow a crew to rescue data from explorers, who preceded them. A member of Cooper's mission is Brand's daughter(Anne Hathaway). Deep on the mind of Cooper's daughter is the fact that if and when her father makes it back to earth, he will be the same age or older than her due to the time warp.No little green men, no aliens in sight. There are a couple of highly intelligent computerized robots, so to speak. Visually awesome and enhanced by Hans Zimmer's score. McConaughey seems driven and invested. Young Miss Foy is very watchable. And Jessica Chastain is excellent in the role of the adult Murph. Also in the cast: John Lithgow, Wes Bently, Matt Damon, William Devane, Casey Affleck and Ellen Burstyn. Plus the voices of Bill Irwin and Josh Stewart. INTERSTELLAR is stellar!",1,1,0,0,0,1,0
Interstellar,"This film tells the story of an ex-pilot in a world full of dust storms. He is chosen to travel to the uncharted parts of the space in search for a new habitable planet.""Interstellar"" is a long film, and the first two hours of it does not seem like a typical Christopher Nolan film. Most of the scenes are (literally) down to Earth, with no fancy visual effects. It spends much time building up the story, telling the story of a father and his daughter who sees 'ghost' in her bedroom. Through this ghost, one thing led to another, and the man is in space. When the film is not down on Earth, it looks more like a disaster film. The first adventure is a spectacular feat involving water. It also introduces the physics of relativity, on how time slows down in another world, leading to a misguided decision of the astronauts in retrospect. This sets the foundation for future plot involving more relativity.As the film progresses, there is more adventure, both in the form of adrenaline pumping adventure and humanity and integrity testing conditions. Matt Damon's character forms a central subplot that makes me reflect on what lengths would people go in order to achieve a certain goal. It reflects on the reality that people are driven by egocentric instincts. It is not a pretty truth, but it tells that human are not idealistic creatures.The final half an hour is what a typical Christopher Nolan film is like. It makes me hold my breath because it is so intense, both emotionally and cognitively. The ending gives me inexplicable exhilaration. Things come to a full circle, and it is filled with joy.It is not a film for everyone, as the story is long and takes a lot of time to build. Two people walked out of the cinema an hour into the film, and someone sitting behind me remarked after the film ended that he opined it was the most boring Christopher Nolan film ever. For me, I enjoyed ""Interstellar"" thoroughly, because it is emotionally captivating and intellectually challenging.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Interstellar,"Interstellar is a science fiction film that tells the story of space travelers that are in search of a new habitable planet in the outer space.The cast includes Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, and Michael Caine. It was written by the Nolan brothers: Jonathan and Christopher,who also the director of the film.The time on Planet Earth is nearly up.Cooper,who happens to be a frustrated farmer as it has fallen victim into famine caused by overpopulation; a blight is killing crops and creating massive dust storms; and the rise of nitrogen that is going to cause asphyxiation that will cause the end of humanity.He also happens to be a former NASA Engineer and trained test pilot that lives with his children,Murp and Tom, together with his father-in-law,Donald.One night,Cooper and Murph reach into a secret underground location that was left by NASA wherein a project headed by Professor Brand that intends to find a habitable planet before the clock on earth runs out.Cooper is found to be qualified in this space exploration wherein the destination happens to be a wormhole near Saturn. He later learns that the wormhole happens to be inhabited by aliens of great intelligence that could help human beings survive the current situation and survive the conditions it is currently experiencing.Ten years back,astronauts were sent to scout a dozen possible habitable planets.But now,the human beings final destination is being determined.Mindful of his children's future,Cooper agrees to pilot the craft together with Brand's daughter, Amelia; scientists Doyle and Romilly and the sardonic robot TARS.Later,Murph grows up into adulthood forming anger towards her father.She becomes an astronaut and Brand's second-in-charge working for the same entity that took her father away from her. The film depicts life on earth for the first 45 minutes.It establishes how humanity is suffering and the close father-and- daughter relationship between Cooper and Murph.The theme of sacrifice is fully explored especially after the father decided to leave his daughter for an space exploration for the sake of billions of people on the planet.It eventually disappoints Murph as she finds out that he may not be able to comeback.When the story shifts into space,the journey of the space exploration becomes the focus of the film.It was good to see Christopher Nolan limit the use of CGI effects so as not to overwhelm the viewer and let them go through the narrative which happens to be far from being clichéd and predictable.The conclusion is where it takes its chances as it tries to resolve the conflicts of the story with some questions left unanswered.Despite being 3 hours long,it was far from being boring for it does not drag and the story is told in a breakneck pace.This is a big-budgeted science fiction movie that is worth more than $160 million that has a very simple tale of love and sacrifice which later becomes breathtaking,hopeful and heartbreaking.It is another visual masterpiece from Nolan especially with the great special effects that is far from overwhelming but truly amazing.The operatic music from Hans Zimmer is also worth mentioning.The complex dialogue about the outer space can also be easily understood by the viewer regardless of one's educational background.Finally,it's an amazing achievement that deserves to be seen on the biggest screen with the best sound system possible. Watching it at home, no matter how good the sound system is, won't match. This one should definitely be seen inside a movie house for it is an awesome and incomparable theater experience.",1,0,0,0,1,0,1
Interstellar,"The good news that we have the brothers reunited and again working on circular narrative. Again, we have a powerful narrative arc that shifts in unexpected and engages in expected ways.The device is hackneyed: messages from the future, but is handled deftly. Where it is clumsy, we are competently distracted by narrative and visual process. The love story that drives this is novel enough to not fall into one of the three formulas commonly used for 'love,' (despite McConaughey) or two for father-rescues-daughter. We have a chosen child who saves the world by supernatural intervention, but again, this doesn't distract. These accomplishments alone make this worth experiencing because many devices are used to reset our expectations from formulas. Some fail horribly and that keeps this film from my absolute essential viewing list; I'll get to those in a moment. But all that are under the control of the filmmaker are so well considered that they bear mention.Take, for example the visual setting. The story itself is about the folding of time, but in a subtle way. The time of the story is in the future, but the setting is in the past. We refer to the dustbowl. All the cars, buildings, clothes and verbal expressions are vaguely from that era. We never see a brand that would pin down the time.More powerfully, the film itself is made as a science fiction film would be in the 50s-60s, using notions and tropes from that era. The robot is from ""Forbidden Planet."" The notion that a world-saving enterprise rests on the mathematical attempts of one man alone. That a vast enterprise is actually secret and located in one spot, with no suppliers. That construction of a spaceship requires welding sparks. That a heavy lift launch can occur in a building.Look at the computer screens. Nearly all are commandline interfaces. The switches and control panels are from the DEW line era. They haven't managed to use legacy fonts in the signage, but it looks like they avoided the most obvious: helvetica.Even the drone is a currently obsolete model. Underscoring all this is setting the film in Texas. Malick, and before him Bogdanovich, Hooper, Welles exploited the fact that Texas lives in two eras, sucking riches from the present while defining itself in some fictitious and better past.The film is also clearly in a future, after antiscience politicians have written technology out of the textbooks, denying the moon landing and forcing something named NASA underground. The ambiguity of time is conveyed subconsciously and works. I think they used some recorded interviews from the actual dustbowl era.But the flaw, the underlying decay in this film is in who they relied on for the science. They clearly separated the science of the adopted genre (noted above) from the science used in the actual extraterrestrial events. They chose renown physicist Kip Thorne as their authority.The man is an important scientist and reportedly very engaging. But the world of such scientists is divided between those who believe in the primary eminence of geometry and those who believe instead in ordered mechanics. This is a deep divide, highly polarized when the work gets going. Which is better for the problems at hand is irrelevant here. But which is better for cinematic depictions of encounters with the forces of the world well there is no contest and Noland chose unwisely. I may write about this. A good title may be the Carl Sagan effect.On other unrelated matters, some unresolved minor plot threads remain. The finished film exceeded the time budget for story-before-launch as it is, but we'd like to know what the reason for introducing the drone was and why it was important.A bit worse: In the film, we have a very hard won ability to send messages back in time, describing deep science from inside a black hole. I get that. But 'before' all those events, some other souls sent back messages and the physical artifact of the wormhole. Why not use that mechanism, unless the much-mentioned notion of the urges of love are essential to the bridge?",0,-999,-999,-999,-999,-999,-999
Interstellar,"One of my all time favourite novels is The Death Of Grass by the late John Christopher . Written in 1956 it tells off a virus that destroys the cereal crops of Asia , Africa and Europe plunging most of humanity in to famine . It was adapted by Cornel Wilde in a 1970 film called NO BLADE OF GRASS , a very bleak and hard hitting film but one that was also painfully disjointed and ultimately unsatisfying . That said the power of the premise is clear to see and one has high hopes it will be remade one day . Along comes Christopher Nolan a director so highly regarded that if he did a selfie on his I-phone then that clip would automatically find itself on the IMDb Top 250 film list and he takes the premise of The Death Of Grass as a plot device and manages to make a film far more unconvincing than Cornel Wilde's movie not t mention far more expensive As I said humanity is being starved in to extinction and live on a diet of corn . Being set in the American mid-West corn is obviously easy to come by but would this be true of other people living on other continents ? I'm not a farmer or a geologist but surely there's a good reason why some countries have a staple diet of wheat while other countries have a staple diet of rice ? Perhaps the countries that no longer can grow wheat now grow root vegetables as their staple diet ? I suppose you've got to join up the dots for yourself but it's rather annoying the way the rest of the world goes unmentioned almost as though the film makers have failed to think the scenario through properly . Especially later where mankind seems to be facing greater dangers from sand storms than famine Some other things the makers haven't thought through with the film In this near future world armies no longer exist ? A noble ideal perhaps but surely if a nation state exists so would an army if only to protect itself from other nation states ? It's official - everyone thinks the Moon landings were faked . I can see Nolan having a dig at creationism being taught in American schools but this ties in with another plot turn NASA still exists as a secretive organization ! Right so the government agency that sent men to the Moon and back exists as a real though somewhat underground organization and yet everyone thinks the Moon landings are faked ? Can't see the logic behind this . It also adds more confusion when ...NASA send the protagonists to a wormhole just off Jupiter . It's never revealed if these space journeys have US government approval but if not why would a government scrap standing armies and not totally shut down an agency that can send people to the ends of the solar system if you're going to teach conspiracy theories in school ? In reality it also be technically and monetary prohibitive for an agency to do this without government approval , Certainly internal logic and continuity is not the films strong point . It's also a film that's over long and contains an ending straight out of the more prentious episodes of SPACE 1999 This is a pity because it's more than competent on a technical level and I can see Nolan is trying to make an intelligent space epic that will try and grab the audiences attention and fire up their passion for real life science . Unfortunately he's left out the intelligence in crafting a drama and when this fails so does everything else",-1,-999,-999,-999,-999,-999,-999
Interstellar,"A simple farm guy named Copper (Matthew McConaughey) and a few other experts go into outer space to explore other worlds that might sustain human life. It seems that that life on Earth might not survive due to to some unexplained environmental disaster. Naturally nothing goes right.WAY overpraised and terrible sci-fi movie. When I heard the plot from this I expected the worst. Writer/director Christopher Nolan has never been a favorite for me--I HATE what he did to Batman in his movie trilogy. I thought that he as trying to imitate Stanley Kubrick (""2001"") here but it's far worse--he's doing Steven Spielberg! The movie runs WAY too long (165 minutes) and they're constantly pushing family friendly values in your face. Cooper's non-stop yammering about his daughter got on my nerves instantly. Also that stupid fake southern accent he adopts is immediately annoying. The story is very slow and all the characters are cardboard cutouts you've seen in other movies. The special effects are flawless and there's some beautiful cinematography here but the extreme length and boring story really weigh it down. Any sort of statement they're trying to make on time and life is completely deadened by the script. Also this movie is very manipulative and way too sentimental. They go out of their way to make the audience cry--like at a Spielberg movie. Well I did cry--tears of joy at the end that this was over! Also the gaps in logic and plot holes here are very annoying. I lost track of how many times I rolled my eyes at the dubious ""logic"" served up here. The acting was as good as it could be (I guess) but, at the end, they throw in a surprise guest star (who I won't name). It didn't help because I think he's a terrible actor and this didn't change my mind. I was bored and looked at my watch MANY times while this played. It's boring, obvious and manipulative.

Interstellar,"I'm probably not the target audience for the freres Nolan as I tend to notice things instead of being seduced. Take the opening. We're in East Jesus in the heart of the dust bowl. An ordinary family, a wooden home one step up from a tarpaper shack. Inside an equally ordinary kitchen THEN, in the bedroom of the daughter of the house, Murph, we find FLOOR-TO-CEILING BOOKSHELVES? Fully stocked. You're putting me on, right, Chris. More? Seems the father of Murph is an ex pilot who has retired to become a farmer. No real problem there BUT, he and Murph stumble on some co-ordinates and follow them to a top-secret NASA base where the head honcho is Professor Michael Caine. They show the intruder the latest space-ship, explain that earth is running out of food and the only solution is to find a planet that will sustain human life AND THEN invite him to lead the mission. This is a guy who hasn't flown in x amount of years and may or may not be in shape. There is no training programme, no vetting, the whole thing resembles a car salesman offering someone who walks in off the street a chance to test drive the latest top-of-the-range Lamborghini. If you can get past this nonsense you may well enjoy what follows. Unlike, say, Gravity, which was virtually one hundred per cent in space, Intersteller does introduce a human element and is all the better for it. Clearly the Nolans are interested in exploiting technology at the expense of constructing an even halfway plausible screenplay and there are probably enough overgrown schoolboys out there who will respond to cgi the way Pavlov's dog responded to a bell.",0,-999,-999,-999,-999,-999,-999
Star Wars,"I couldn't have asked for anything more. Star Wars: A New Hope had it all. If I had to sum it up in one word, superlative would be my answer. I saw the film for the first time three months ago and loved it, and since then I have watched all the Star Wars movies. I was disappointed with the prequels (Attack of the Clones was my least favourite), but this, Return of the Jedi and Empire Strikes Back were perfection.I have to say that the film looks absolutely amazing even after thirty plus years, with highly imaginative sets and dazzling special effects. And the action sequences were superbly choreographed and brisk, the Death Star climax was a knockout. The music by John Williams is absolutely outstanding, by far one of his more exciting and rousing scores. The story is fast-paced, intelligent and has an essence of sophistication, and the screenplay is sharp and decisive.And the performances were flawless. In the prequels I had problems relating to some of the performers, namely Hayden Christensen as Anakin. Here, all the actors played their parts with superlative skill. Alec Guiness, one fine actor and will be sorely missed was a standout, likewise with Peter Cushing and Harrison Ford(hilarious here). Carrie Fisher was a fine Princess Leia, spunky, beautiful and sexy, and Mark Hamill was a completely likable Luke. And the villain Darth Vader, without doubt one of the best and in-depth villains in cinematic history, and James Earl Jones's deep booming voice was perfect for the character.All in all, a definite sci-fi classic, that blew me away. 10/10 Bethany Cox",1,1,1,0,0,1,1
Star Wars,"The awesome special effects and the creation of creatures that are part of the vivid imagination of George Lucas are not the reason for the enduring popularity of Star Wars and the franchise it spawned. Rather it is because of the characters Lucas created that will live as long as we have cinema and the means to display it.The spectacle is behind some real, but simple people. No shadings of gray in the first Star Wars we know without any doubt who the heroes and villains are of this piece. On an isolated planet a galaxy wide dictatorship called the Empire and the revolt against come to wear young Luke Skywalker as played by Mark Hamill and his family reside. So does Alec Guinness, a reclusive and mysterious hermit. An escape pod crashes there with two androids, C3PO and R2D2 and in the latter is a message for Guinness who was at one time a Jedi Knight, fiercest of a warrior class, from Carrie Fisher playing Princess Leia. Also in R2D2 are the schematics for the Empire's ultimate weapon the satellite size death star that can deal killing out on a planetary scale. This starts an adventure with young Hamill who teams up with futuristic soldier of fortune Harrison Ford as Han Solo and his simian like sidekick Chewbacca to rescue the Princess and defeat the Death Star.Those are the good guys. The bad guys are the blackest of black villainy. Peter Cushing cold bloodedly commands the Death Star, but the mysterious Darth Vader, clad in black with a helmet completely covering his head, has mysterious powers and even his superiors are wary of him. The voice of James Earl Jones is unforgettable as the black prince of the galaxy.These are characters that bring out the kid in all of us. The ones who claim the most sophistication in their lives will cheer on for Hamill and Ford and will be fascinated by the double dyed villainy of Darth Vader.Perhaps the most interesting aspect of Star Wars and I speak now of all the films is the way such non-humans as the robots and Chewbacca the Wookie became characters. C3PO had dialog, but R2D2 had a few clicks and bleeks and all Chewbacca did was grunt, still they became as identifiable as the human characters.Star Wars set the standard for science fiction films to come for the next several generations. It was given six Oscars in a bunch of technical categories and it's got a re-release value that Gone With The Wind used to have.The Force Will Be With Us Always.",1,0,0,0,0,0,1
Star Wars,"Star Wars (1977) **** (out of 4) Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) joins forces with Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness) as they plan to go after Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) who is being held hostage by Darth Vadar.Whether people like it or not, STAR WARS is one of those ground-breaking movies that became a massive hit and it eventually took over the world. Watching the film so many years later it really is amazing what George Lucas was able to do with this film and what would follow. I will gladly admit that I'm not a fanboy of this series and in fact this recent viewing was the first time I had seen this since it was released in its Special Edition form. With that said, even though I'm not a ""fanboy"" it's impossible to deny that power that this film contains.Storywise there's really nothing overly ground-breaking here but in my opinion that's what makes the film so darn good. There's no long-winded or drawn-out story to drag things down. The basic premise is rather simple as an up-and-coming fighter gets his opportunity to be great and sets out to do so. I think this simple story makes the characters stand out all the better because it really gives them a chance to shine and come to life. It certainly also helps that Lucas was clearly a fan of those cliffhangers from previous decades because he knows how to build up scenes and milk them for everything they're worth.It's really hard to say anything fresh or new about this film but watching this first one it's easy to see why people like Hamill and Fisher became iconic in these parts. Both are quite good in the film as are Alec Guinness and Peter Cushing, the two veterans of the picture. With that said, I think it goes without saying that it's Harrison Ford who really stands out in the role of Han Solo. His comic timing with Chewbacca has made for some of the most memorable moments of this film and he's simply delightful to watch in the role.Of course, fans will debate the tinkering that Lucas has done with the picture but I think both versions hold up extremely well. I understand the purist who want to view what they originally saw in theaters and I understand those who defend the updating of the effects. Either way, STAR WARS is a rare blockbuster that also manages to be extremely well-made and deserving of its reputation.",1,1,1,0,0,1,0
Star Wars,"Okay, so as a kid this was one of my favourite films. But as you grow up things change and on second viewing, I found this film to be surprisingly slow in places and actually comes close to outstaying its welcome towards the end. These aren't big flaws, mind you, but ones which niggle at me and make me feel as if I'm betraying a universal dream in some way. The truth is that I far prefer the second and third entries in this series, as they don't have to go through the troubles of introducing all the characters, and instead can simply continue the action at a fast speed.There are many good things about this film to make it worthwhile, though. This is one of those movies with a comic book feel to it which can appeal to adults and children alike. There's a sufficiently 'epic' nature to the film, in that a whole other universe has been created and we are merely viewing a part of what happens in it. There's plenty of action, ranging from the traditional light-saber fights to some exciting space skirmishes. The huge budget allows for many, many different special effects. Some of these look a little ropey today but they're all infinitely superior to the overblown, laughable CGI antics in THE PHANTOM MENACE, where all touch with reality was lost.The characters are likable and clear-cut; you've got heroic heroes and evil villains. Mark Hamill is fine as Luke Skywalker, although it's sad that he never achieved success in any other movies NOT in the STAR WARS series. Harrison Ford provides a clean, charismatic action man in Han Solo. Carrie Fisher is pretty and funny as Princess Leia, and Alec Guinness lends heavyweight support to the whole affair with his Obi-Wan Kenobi. The only downside to the cast are the inclusion of the robots C3P0 and R2-D2 and Chewie, who are, seen today in an adult light, pretty irritating, it has to be said. But for kids, they're funny.The villains always tend to be the best guys in these films and this is no exception. Darth Vader is THE king of cool, and I always wanted to be him when I was younger. It's strange to think how strongman Dave Prowse when from being the monster in Hammer's lame HORROR OF FRANKENSTEIN to becoming one of the biggest screen villains of all time. One also mustn't forget the contribution of Peter Cushing in what was his most popular movie; he lends gravity to the movie and is excellent as the icy commander of the Death Star, mainly through his voice alone.Although this is a long film, the action is split up across a number of different planets in order to make it more interesting. There are laser battles, lots of shooting, brief gore (an arm-lopping), and all manner of weird and wonderful rubbery alien creatures to make it enjoyable. I especially loved the scene in the garbage disposal unit which uses the old ""closing walls"" routine on our heroes to great effect. This is a deservedly famous movie which kick-started a whole new mythos, brought a legion of movie nerd fans together and harked back to the great days of the sci-fi serials of the late '30s and '40s. Not the best of the series, but pretty darned good going.",1,1,0,0,0,1,1
Star Wars,"This story happened 'A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away'. The galaxy is under the dictatorship of the emperor. Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) is part of the rebellion but is capture by the evil Darth Vader. Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) the young hero, Han Solo (Harrison Ford) the brigand, his sidekick Chewbacca, and the wise master Jedi Ben Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness) must together rescue the princess and save the galaxy.The characters are icons pulled from classic storytelling like Akira Kurosawa's ""The Hidden Fortress"". George Lucas was able to assemble such iconic characters into a well told story. Rarely is a movie change the nature of movie-making, and even the wider culture. This may be on the list of the most important movie ever. It changed the tone of movies from the gritty morally-confused 70s to the popcorn selling blockbusters that are soon to come.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Star Wars,"""Star Wars"" is a 2-hour science fiction movie from almost 30 years ago written and directed by George Lucas. There really needs nothing to be said about how good this is for a 1970s movie, especially in terms of technical aspects. The Academy certainly got it right by giving them all these Oscars for it. However, it lacks in certain other areas unfortunately. First of all, the acting isn't too great. That is not really a problem of the characters though, but rather of the way they were written, which simply offered no room for outstanding performances. And Peter Cushing's character was downright forgettable despite being the main antagonist. Instead people remember Darth Vader obviously. Why? Because this film is all about the way the characters look and not what they do or say. A bit style over substance. Apart from that, I am quite surprised Alec Guinness scored an Academy Award nomination for his turn here.The script is not the greatest achievement in general. It's the usual black-and-white characterization with good vs evil and the characters have no real shades, no facets. This was made up again by the strong work in other departments as it's not too memorable what they say and do, but what they look like, especially the non-human characters who are all somewhat considered legendary today. I am not saying the characters are written badly. Not at all. But it's just other contributions that made them what they are today. Not the script. And while I enjoyed most of the film, I cannot see it as an epic or a cult classic as so many people do to this date. ""Star Wars"" is bound to rise again with the new film coming out soon and featuring the original cast again. It should be interesting what they make out of it. Until then, feel free to watch the old films like this one, but not too many. The very first Star Wars film here is not a great achievement in terms of story, only in terms of all visual and audible aspects.",1,0,0,0,0,-1,0
Star Wars,"I will never forget the hoopla associated with this movie. Having seen articles in Time and Newsweek, my friend and I took off early from work and made our way to the one theater in the Minneapolis Metro area that was showing ""Star Wars"" (boy have times changed!). There were local news stations, reporters, models, everywhere. How we were able to just walk to the window and purchase tickets, I don't know, but we did. I still have my blue button with ""May the Force be With You"" emblazoned on it. I'm told it's pretty valuable. A reporter approached us and asked my friend, ""What do you expect."" He responded in his sort of wise ass way, ""A sprawling intergalactic epic.""That was all very interesting, but when we finally sat down and the movie began, I found it was less than I had hoped for. Part of my problem was that at that time, most of what I read was science fiction. As I watched the events unfold, I realized that this movie wasn't really science fiction--it was a Western. It was the good guy versus the bad guy and an effort to save the old ranch that the bad guys have pillaged. Take out the awesome special effects and the cool aliens and it just wasn't very interesting. I realize that most of the people that have seen this consider it just slightly below the second coming--nearly a religious experience--but it wasn't for me. I saw nothing new or complex about the character or the themes in the movie. As far as speculative science fiction it is barren. Don't get me wrong, I still think that there are amazing things to watch, but I can't get past the fact that the storm troopers can't hit the broad side of a barn with laser weapons but the good guys can pick off about a dozen from behind a post. Where did these guys get their training? How has the Empire survived so long with these incompetents. Having read ""Dune"" years before this film came out, I have to be brutally honest--how George Lucas didn't get sued for stealing from that book, I'll never know. I always wondered if he made a deal with Frank Herbert.The worlds are exotic. The aliens are wonderful (although, I thought the second and third movies were much better), especially that bar scene. But the bottom line is that it's an adventure movie. Maybe someday someone will convince me otherwise (I have had about 50 people try). If I'm going to watch a Western, I prefer the Earps and Doc Holliday.",-1,-999,-999,-999,-999,-999,-999
Star Wars,"The Republic has fallen and the Empire rules the galaxy as a dictatorship, seeking to destroy dissenting voices. The Empire's ultimate weapon, the Death Star, is fully on line and capable of destroying whole systems. The Jedi have been destroyed, save a few living in hiding, unable to compete with the force of the Empire. However Princess Leia has the plans showing a weakness within the Death Star. Before she is captured by Darth Vader she gives them to droids C3PO and R2D2 and they escape. When they land on a nearby planet they find Luke Skywalker and set out to find the owner of the droids Obi Wan Kenobi, or Old Ben Kenobi. Obi Wan begins to train Luke in the way of the force as they try to get the information to the Rebellion before the Death Star can be used at full power.It's not a brilliant piece of filmmaking  lets be honest, Lucas isn't the Shakespeare of our generation. However what it is, is a good story of good v's evil, a western of goodies v baddies set in space. The story is simple but contains clear characters. The thing that sets it apart is the fun  the sense of wonder for kids but also the enjoyment it brings to adult. The story is good for a sci-fi with a lot of history and back-story clearly set out up front. The action scenes are mostly great  not dry effects but with a real sense of action and excitement too.This may be the 4th part but it's also our first chapter, it is light and enjoyable but hints that this is only part of an ongoing battle. The way it relates to kids and adults is obvious as it broke records and everyone of a certain age knows about Star Wars! The effects still look good today  in many ways the model work looks better than all digital effects simply because they are `real' and don't just exist within a computer. Sound effects, comedy, music  it's all pitch perfect and sets up the rest of the series really well.Hamil is ok as Skywalker (`Blonde hair, blue eyes'  Chasing Amy!). He is suitable for a kids film and he does well with his role. However like part 1 has Anakin at his least interesting, part 4 has Luke yet to develop into darker areas. Ford is perfect as Han Solo  he adds character and flair to some dry performances. Alec Guinness adds maturity to the whole film and is so good is Obi Wan that even Ewan McGregor just does an impression rather than recreate the role. Darth Vader is just the right side of silly camp villain, Jones' voice is a perfect fit and he has real menace and power. Bits players such as Chewie, C3PO, R2D2 etc all add comedy in spades.Overall this film is even better now that we know how it all fits together in Star Wars `history'. But even without all the hype this is a really fun sci-fi that is enjoyable, simple and really good fun to watch if you're in the mood. Having a deeper perspective on it just makes it all the better.",1,0,1,0,1,0,1
Star Wars,"During the attack of the Empire's forces under the command of Darth Vader (David Prowse) to her spacecraft, the rebel Princess Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher) hides in the memory of R2-D2 the plans of the powerful Empire's Station Death Star that spies from the Rebel Alliance have stolen. She assigns the droid to deliver the plans to Obi-Wan Kenobi with a message to give the plans to the rebels. R2-D2 flees to the Planet Tatooine with his fellow C-3PO in a space pod and land on the desert, but they are captured by Jawa traders. They are sold to Owen Lars (Phil Brown) and when his nephew Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) is cleaning the droid, he accidentally activates part of the message and he wonders whether it would be addressed to the old Ben Kenobi. On the next morning, Luke discovers that R2-D2 is seeking out Obi-Wan Kenobi and he goes after him with C-3PO. They are attacked by the Tusken Raiders and saved by a drifter, who is Ben Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness) that tells part of his past as Jedi to Luke. He also tells that his father was a Jedi Knight and gives a light-saber that belonged to his father to Luke. Obi-Wan invites Luke to travel with him to Alderaan and when he finds that his family was killed by the Imperial soldiers, he decides to join Obi-Wan in his quest. They head to Mos Esley to hire a skilled pilot and they team-up with the smugglers Han-Solo (Harrison Ford) and Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew). Meanwhile the evil Grand Moff Tarkin (Peter Cushing) orders to destroy the planet Alderaan to show the power of the Death Star to Leia and the rebels.

All the films are engaging, but none of them can beat this one rated #19 in IMDb. Harrison Ford in the top of his career and the cast show a wonderful chemistry.

Star Wars,"After seeing all six episodes of the Star Wars saga several times apiece, I still think this initial entry is interesting but one of weaker ones in the series. Perhaps that's because by now, the special-effects look primitive but also because it's a little slow in parts, slower than the other five films. Sometimes, though, it's nice to have more lulls as these modern-day action films many times overdo the violence. This one, however, is just a bit too slow overall.The first hour of this film sets up the second hour plus the two sequels that followed in the 1980s, showing how the principal characters were united, who they are fighting against and what mystical powers they have at their disposal. Note: it was even interesting to watch this film decades later after the final installment, episode 3, was viewed. It made this first entry make a little more sense, knowing the complete story (who was related to whom, how some died, etc.). It was also a shock to go back and see the special-effects in here after viewing those final three films issued in recent years.I always got annoyed, to be honest, at two things in this initial Star Wars film I felt were overdone: the ""Rambo"" mentality in which hundreds of shots are fired at the good guys and never hit them and the constant arguing between Carrie Fisher (""Princess Leia"") and Harrison Ford (""Han Solo""). By the third film, thankfully, that bickering stopped and everyone was ""on the same page.""Despite how old this film is, it's a ""must"" for this collection since it sets up so much of what is to follow.

Star Wars,"This is where it all started, the original trilogy and saga of science-fiction epic adventures, from Oscar and Golden Globe nominated writer/director/creator George Lucas. ""A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away"" the universe in ruled in fear by the Empire, and a new threat has been completed, the Death Star battle station. The rebels however have managed to capture the plans for the station, and Senator Princess Leia Organa (introducing Carrie Fisher) places them into the memory of droid R2-D2 (Kenny Baker). R2 with companion droid C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) escape the ship and land the desert world Tatooine, the Princess meanwhile is held captive by the Emperor's trusted servant Darth Vader (acted by David Prowse, voiced by James Earl Jones) and battle station leader Grand Moff Tarkin (Peter Cushing). R2 and 3PO meanwhile eventually end up with farm boy Luke Skywalker (introducing Mark Hamill) who lives on the planet with his Aunt and Uncle. While cleaning R2, he comes across the message from the Princess, mentioning Obi-Won Kenobi (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Sir Alec Guinness), an former Jedi Knight who they find in the desert. After his relatives are killed, Luke wants to learn the ways of the Force and become a Jedi. They contract pilots of the Millennium Falcon, Han Solo (introducing Harrison Ford) and Wookie Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) to take them across the galaxy at light speeds. They travel to what was the Princess's planet, Alderaan, but they are pulled in by tracker beam by what destroyed it, the Death Star. After avoiding the stormtroopers, and rescuing the Princess, they eventually escape after removing the beam, but Obi-Won was killed (and became one with the Force) after being killed by his former pupil, Vader. The concluding scenes are the craft and laser battles with the Rebels and the Empire, Darth Vader escapes (giving way to the sequel), and Luke eventually blows up the Death Star (with a great explosion), and the heroes are rewarded, a happy ending.

Star Wars,"I couldn't let the thirtieth anniversary season of ""Star Wars"" slip by without a commemorative viewing today to remind me of the start of this hugely successful franchise. Though it's not one of my own personal Top Ten films of all time, I can understand how so many fans come to see it that way. At the time it was a seminal film that reinvigorated the sci-fi genre; my first viewing when it debuted in theaters garnered more than a single 'Whoa' with each new scene and concept that hadn't been done before. I was particularly intrigued with the names of the characters George Lucas created for his heroes, sounding uniquely original and matching their physical description and characters. Could Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, or Princess Leia have been called anything else? How about Jabba the Hutt; he looks exactly how a Jabba the Hutt would look if there was a Jabba the Hutt. Makes sense, doesn't it? I get a kick out of the nay sayers on this board who have such a fierce guttural reaction to the success of the entire Star Wars franchise, never missing an opportunity to thrash it unmercifully. The best response to that I guess would be that they represent a mere six and a half per cent minority of the IMDb voting history for this film that give it less than a 6.0 rating. It reminds me of that joke about the one in three people who might be crazy, and your two best friends seem alright. Something to think about.Anyway, there's no point in detailing the film since virtually every one on the planet has probably seen it at least once, even my wife. My son, who was born in 1977, has probably seen it thirty times a year every year since he started watching movies, kind of a record in itself I would think, allowing him to quote virtually every line of dialog from the movie.

Star Wars,"When I first watched this in the cinema I was ten, it was 1977 and I'd never seen anything like it. It had me gripped from the start when a small spacecraft flew past being fired upon by another much larger one that was so big that it seemed to take ages to pass over the viewer. Unlike the recent prequels scenes such as this weren't cluttered with excessive CGI activity but instead showed what was needed in a way that hadn't been seen before. The special effects used throughout the film were ground-breaking for the time and still look great to this day, there is something more real looking about the models used when compared to today's CGI.The main character are all interesting and likable and the acting was all pretty good both from veteran actors like Alec Guinness and Peter Cushing who brought a suitable gravitas to the film and from younger actors Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher who brought a sense of youthful energy.In the unlikely event that somebody doesn't know what the film is about I'll give a brief synopsis; Set in a distant galaxy the forces of the evil galactic empire are hunting down the rebels who are attempting to restore the old republic. They are about to capture a rebel ship which has the stolen plans to the empires latest weapon, the Death Star, when they are hidden in a small robot (droid) by the name of R2-D2 by Princess Leah, he escapes in one of the ships escape pods along with his companion C3PO. They escape to the desert world of Tatooine where they are swiftly captured by strange creatures called Jawas who sell the pair to a farmer who gets his nephew Luke to clean them. While doing so he stumbles across a holographic message addressed to one Obi-Wan Kenobi. While Luke is off having his dinner R2-D2 escapes seeking Obi Wan.The next day Luke sets off to find him but shortly after doing so he is ambushed by Sand People who start ransacking his vehicle till they are disturbed by a robed figure who turns out to be Obi-Wan. He explains to Luke that he was once a Jedi knight and friend of his late father who had been killed by another Jedi called Darth Vader who had turned to the dark side of the force, they also see the full message that R2 is carrying which requests that Obi-Wan takes R2 to the planet Alderaan to get the plans to the rebels. While this is happening Vader who is on the ship searching for the plans dispatches troops to search for the two missing droids. By the time Luke returns home it is too late, the place is a burn out ruin and his aunt and uncle are dead. He decides that he will join Obi-Wan on his mission to Alderaan.They hire a ship, called the Millennium Falcon, from a smuggler called Han Solo who needs the money to pay off a debt and avoid the various bounty hunter who are after him. When they arrive at Alderaan they find it is no longer there, it has in fact been destroyed by the Death Star in an attempt to get Princess Leah to tell them where the rebels are based. Soon after arriving the Millennium Falcon is captured after it goes to investigate a small moon that turns out to be the Death Star. While Obi-Wan is off trying to disable the tractor beam that captured them Han and Luke discover that Princess Leah is being held in the detention area and set off to rescue her... I won't say any more as I don't want to spoil the ending.I think this is a film every body should see at least once, it might not be perfect but if it wasn't for this recent cinematic history would be quite different; it kick-started a revival in science fiction that lead to things like Battlestar Galactica, the return of Star Trek and Alien and was possibly the first ""block-buster"" film. In many ways it was more than just a film it was an event; everybody at my school was talking about it and little else, till one watched it you were completely out of the loop.

Star Wars,"There was no way my review of this classic slab of pulp sci-fi was ever going to be anything but glowing; as a nine year old I saw George Lucas' space opera on its original release and instantly became one of a legion of fans who spent the next twenty years worshipping at the altar of the great turkey-necked director (until The Phantom Menace shattered all of my illusions).Thirty years on, and I'm revisiting Star Wars with my two children, hoping that they will fall in love with it as much as I did, way back when all that seemed important was having a bag-full of marbles and a decent sized pile of comics to read.I'm not going to describe the plot (surely you know that!), nor am I going to go into great detail about how Lucas borrowed elements from the movies he loved to bring us his epic about a farm boy who becomes a legendary warrior; all I can say is that the film has lost none of its ability to astound and my kids sat entranced (despite not being able to follow the story without the benefit of some additional info from their sci-fi geek dad). My son (who is only three and a half ) might not understand what a 'rebellion' is, and my daughter (nearly six) may struggle with the concept of 'the force', but both got a kick from witnessing the whole Star Wars universe for the very first time.Chewbacca was an instant hit with my boy, whereas my girl identified with Leia, the gutsy princess. Both of them loved the brilliantly realised landscapes, aliens, robots and spaceships that have wowed film-fans for three decades (and who can blame themthe attention to detail and sheer creativity in design, costume, and make-up is staggering).It has since become evident that old George ain't always the greatest writer or director in the world (the last three Star Wars movies are proof of that); however, when he does get it right, he works miracles (he wrote Raiders of the Lost Ark tooanother solid gold movie).Star Wars is perfect family entertainment that delivers amazing spectacle, unforgettable characters and enough movie magic to last a lifetime.

Obviously,it is a legendarily expansive and ambitious start to the sci- fi saga, George Lucas opened our eyes to the possibilities of blockbuster filmmaking and things have never been the same.It is a magnificent film.Lucas set out to make the biggest possible adventure fantasy out of his memories of serials and older action epics, and he succeeded brilliantly.It is a seminal movie that began a whole cycle of sci-fi works and also launched the careers of many actors and craftsmen.A sweeping epic with classical themes lifted from the teachings of Joseph Campbell, but it maintains strong central characters.And most of all,it is one of the most enduring movies of all time.",1,0,0,1,0,0,0
Star Wars,"I recently revisited this, and remembered first seeing it. It wasn't the first movie to be heavily hyped. But I recall it as the first one to appeal to kids as a big adventure.In a couple ways, what's come since have ruined this. Lucas himself ruined it by deciding to make all those extra ones, making up the story as he went. And of course, every month on average we now have a new special effects movie that matches the star wars franchise in visual ambition. Many of these in fact are fueled by Lucas' several companies.So its impossible to recapture that thrill. At the time, yes we knew he stole from Kurosawa, and leaned heavily on Joseph Campbell's notions of myth. But it all seemed so fresh, and Lucas himself came across as a visionary genius. And we needed that more than we needed entertainment.Remember, the US had just been through its first sleazy republican scandal and the nation as a whole was discouraged. But the world of movies was exploding. Woody Allen gave us ""Annie Hall."" Scorcese became known. And then this. The thing that impressed us at the time was how seriously it took itself, despite how childishly goofy that intergalactic bar was. Also how powerful the sounds and images were.The mythology was so clear. We had it for decades in science fiction and fantasy novels, indeed much better. But this was the first time we had them cinematically, and cinema when it works may be the most powerful of packaged imaginations. Oh how I wish we could see it as we did then.Now we notice, for instance, how ordinary the dogfights are. These used to thrill. We don't have all the mystery that made the thing deep. Now we know who everyone is and what is going on, and it is all so much more ordinary than what we imagined at the time as possibilities.In later years, Lucas would let us down, as a person and in this saga. In fact, I think he ruined some things. But for the year of this event, he was the most celebrated singer in the choir. And by me as well.What do I mean about ruining? Things evolve. When one thing finds a niche and flourishes, it pinches off other things. When ""Birth of a Nation"" became a huge success, it froze movies as filmed plays with a larger stage instead of one of the several other directions it could have taken. Again, there was a period after talkies reinvented the medium where there was a struggle among various different directions. This you can clearly see in the period. In retrospect, it appears as if the world could have only turned out the way it did. But the trends that win aren't the best at all.So ""Star Wars"" opened up a gateway for how effects could transform cinema into something far beyond what we had before. And then it closed that gateway, so that effects now cannot show you something unfamiliar. Instead, it all has to be the familiar taken to some extreme.Yes, it was a goose at the time. But Star Wars killed the greater possibilities of science fiction. In film, at least, and because books are inherently cinematic now, in books too.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Star Wars,"Princess Leia is captured and held hostage by the Imperial Army as it seeks to rule the Galactic Empire. An old Jedi Knight by the name of Ben ""Obi-Wan"" Kenobi may just be hers, and the rebels only hope. Teaming up with farm boy Luke Skywalker, scoundrel Captain Han Solo, and a couple of quirky droids, Kenobi sets off on a mission that could well shape the destiny of the Galaxy, and all who dwell within it.Back in 1977 I was but a wee 11 year old boy, weened on films from all genres by my movie loving parents, I had no idea that Star Wars was to have the same impact on me as Jaws had two summers previously, where yet again I found myself queueing around the block for two whole hours to see a film in a one screen theatre. My love of cinema firmly cemented, Star Wars was the start of a love affair that lasts to this very day.As the years have rolled by and my love of cinema has taken on more in-depth and serious tones, I have come to realise that Star Wars proves to be a far from flawless picture. Certainly its detractors do point to some frayed acting and call the plot structure a jazzed up good versus evil axis, while the charge of George Lucas referencing many prior pictures most assuredly stands, but really do those things matter? No they do not, because Star Wars opened up a new world of cinema, something of a portal to youngsters such as I, it got people talking and debating about the merits of model work in films (which is of an extraordinary high standard here), it nudged film makers to explore being bigger and bolder in their approach, and crucially, above all else, it got film goers hungry again, a hankering for more please if you may. Now it has to be said that all that followed 20th Century Fox's historic blockbuster didn't run with the baton, in fact most pale into comparison on impact value, but for better or worse (depending on the discerning viewers peccadilloes), Star Wars stands as a bastion of adventure laden entertainment.It is by definition one of the most successful films in history, George Lucas perhaps didn't know it at the time, but in what was to become an almost operatic anthology, he didn't just make a movie, he created a whole new world seeping with style and rich texture. Almost as amazing as the success of the series, is how it has become part of modern day pop culture, anything from religion to everyday speak has at some time or another referenced Lucas' baby. Ultimately, though, it's one single thing that made (and still does make) Star Wars so great, it's that it has the ability to lift the audience into a rousing united feel good cheer; and that is something that few films can ever lay claim too. In 1977 it was an awe inspiring event to watch in the theatre, now here in my middle age it's an event that is like hugging a dear old friend, a friend that I know will never ever let me down no matter how many times I turn to it. 10/10",1,0,0,1,0,0,0
Star Wars,"I`ve never really thought much of STAR WARS . I remember when it was released in 1977 everyone was going bannanas as to how good it was . I finally managed to see it when it was broadcast on television in 1982 and was very disappointed with what I saw , okay it was entertaining to a certain degree but I didn`t believe for one moment it deserved the hype or massive audience figures . One other thing that sprung to my mind many years later is that it`s unoriginal!!!! SPOILERS TO THIS AND LOTR !!!!I can`t help thinking that Obi Wan Kenobi has been based on Gandalf from LORD OF THE RINGS . They`re both wise old men , they both "" die "" a heroic death and both come come back as etheral beings in the trilogy and both are played in the films by Knights of the stage. However whereas Ian Mckellan gives an outstanding performance as Gandalf Alec Guinness has little impact as Obi Wan . I do not say this lightly as I rate Guinness as the greatest actor of the 20th century . In fact as one reviewer has already pointed out none of the actors give much of a performance except Harrison Ford who is the only member of the cast who went onto become a household name . Compare the performances of the cast of the LOTR trilogy who could all easily pass as Knights of the stageI`m not saying this is a bad movie - it`s not . It is entertaining and does have a sense of humour and the costume design is excellent especially the stormtrooper uniforms but what I`m saying is it`s not a great one either and certainly doesn`t deserve to be in the IMDB top ten movies .
And as a footnote is it just coincidence that Christopher Lee was cast in ATTACK OF THE CLONES after appearing in LORD OF THE RINGS ?",-1,-999,-999,-999,-999,-999,-999
Star Wars,"There's hardly anything this reviewer can say that hasn't already been said, and said better, numerous times before, about this milestone in cinema and the popular culture. The story, of a simple farm boy from an isolated desert planet meeting his destiny as one of the brave souls fighting an evil intergalactic organization, is wonderful fantasy in a science-fiction setting.The mythology it creates ensures its staying power, as well as the many endearing and entertaining characters we meet along the way. There's the reckless, macho mercenary Han Solo (Harrison Ford) who learns something about doing things for others rather than just himself, the wizened old warrior Ben / Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness) who instructs our young hero Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) on the ways of the ""Force"", the young Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) determined to right the wrongs being perpetrated in this universe, the loyal anthropoid spaceship co-pilot Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew), the menacing bad ass that is the black garbed Darth Vader (David Prowse / voice of James Earl Jones), and the odd couple robots R2-D2 (Kenny Baker) and C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) who provide us with a healthy amount of comedy relief.The movie is cast to perfection, with old pros like Peter Cushing and Mr. Guinness supporting the talented up and comers Hamill, Ford, and Fisher. A team of technical wizards, who pioneered some ingenious special effects, bring us from one visually astounding environment to another, from the desert wastes of Tatooine to the stark efficiency of the armoured space station The Death Star. John Williams, the man behind some of the most instantly recognizable soundtracks of all time, supplies the iconic score here that lets us know, right from the first moments of the film, that we're in for a good time.Of course, those of us who have become extremely familiar with the film over time would give anything to once again be experiencing it for the first time, which is why it's a joy to see it with younger viewers as they are introduced to its sense of wonder. It's equal parts thrilling, suspenseful, and humorous, and gives us an effective final dogfight in space equivalent to that of an old time war movie.Just speaking personally, this has great resonance for me as it was one of those treasured films of my youth and one had better believe that I was a proud owner of a number of the toys. I always looked forward to a viewing and even as an adult when I know what to expect, the fun factor of the thing still comes through strong.This is definitely one of those films that cinema lovers ought to see at least once in their lifetime.Nine out of 10.",1,1,1,0,1,1,1
