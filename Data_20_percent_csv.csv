The Mandalorian,"It seems be a gift for the old fans of ""Star Wars"". a return to the origins, after the last films, too obvious having as target the new generations. In same measure, it is a brilliant example of the use for western recipe. And the couple of silent loner and baby Yoda works in beautiful way. The cinematography is great, the storytelling - well crafted. I admit- for me the basic source of seduction remains the presence of Wener Herzog in a role perfect for Klaus Kinski.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1
The Mandalorian,"If you are watching a Star Wars marathon in chronological order, place this series between episodes VI and VII. The New Republic is weak and the remnant of the empire have become warlords and mercenaries. The Mandalorian is also a legendary mercenary whose family was killed during the Droid War. He hates droids. In episode one he is to retrieve a live bounty that turns out to be a 50 year old baby Yoda. It would not be the real Yoda, but born while Yoda was still alive and about 900 years old. For the rest of the series he beats up folks who are after the baby Yoda and how this fits into anything is not clear. Typical Star Wars characters and it looks like before this is over, everyone in Hollywood will be a $100 autograph at a Star Wars convention. They also bring back HellBoy.",1,1,1,1,1,1,0
The Mandalorian,"Right, well yeah, I grew up on ""Star Wars"" and have been loving it ever since ""Star Wars Episode 4: A New Hope"", and I am still loving it today. So when ""The Mandalorian"" was announced, I was thrilled.And now having sat through the entire first season, I must say that I am impressed and I am entertained, and I am enjoying this tremendously. Creator Jon Favreau is definitely on to something here with this series; something that is as close to the original trilogy as it can be. And man, this is phenomenal.The storyline is interesting and has a good variety to it, so there is something for everybody, ranging from classic ""Star Wars"" action in terms of duels, gunfights, space combat, and such - you know what I mean here.And ""The Mandalorian"" offers a nice insight into the term of being a Mandalorian, as they have been fairly poorly portrayed for the average public and casual viewers, anyone not well-traversed in the universe of ""Star Wars"". I mean, this show made one of my friends come up and say to me, 'I thought Mandalorians were evil, but it is a way of living, a mentality, a creed'.The special effects in this TV series is good, but as if there ever were any doubts with Lucasfilm and Disney being behind the project. And it has that classic ""Star Wars"" feel to it, but with an added multiple layers. They managed to make it a tad more gritty and also have that classic Western feel to it. And it works marvelously in favor of the series.As for the main character, the Mandalorian, aka Dyn Jarren, well he is interesting, and there are some really nice qualities and touches to the character, and I must say that Pedro Pascal portrays the helmet main character quite well. While he is the main character, there is no doubt about the fact that the child - as the public dubbed 'baby Yoda' - has stolen the show. And what is not to like? He is so awesome, cute and he wields The Force. I liked the child from the very first time we saw him on the screen, and with each episode my liking has just grown and grown.""The Mandalorian"" plays on all the right buttons for a fan of the ""Star Wars"" universe, especially when they brought stormtroopers, scout troopers, death troopers and the TIE fighter into the series. That just felt right; it felt like coming home.Now, the series is not carried by Pedro Pascal alone, there are some nice acting performances by the likes of Carl Weathers, Werner Herzog, Gina Carano and Nick Nolte, to mention the most prominent of performers. They have a great cast, and people perform quite well, bringing the characters to life in this rich and vibrant universe.The props and costumes are spot on, and there are so many amazing details in every episode. This helped bring the ""Star Wars"" universe out on the screen in such a great way.I have seen every episode three or four times; the first time around for the storyline, then going back to watch it for the details. Plus, I must admit that the show is entertaining enough to support multiple viewings.This is certain winner for the ""Star Wars"" universe, and it was a much needed addition to the franchise. I am rating it a solid ten out of ten stars.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1
The Mandalorian,"I'm amazed at how going off track from the main Star Wars storyline has produced, arguably, better movies and shows. Sure, Baby Yoda aka Grogu, is adorable enough to make any warm-blooded person fall in love.""The Mandalorian"" is indispensable watching for anyone who even has a passing interest in ""Star Wars"" and the season two finale was the coup de grace.",1,1,1,1,1,1,-999
The Mandalorian,"After so many years of postponing I finally decided to watch all the Star Wars movies and so also this series. Since there are different ways to watch it I'm going for the chronological order and not the release date order, that just makes more sense to me. Maybe I watched a couple movies when I was young, I probably did, but I don't remember anything about it so to me it's all new and maybe one day I will understand the whole hype about the Star Wars saga. After watching The Phantom Menace, Attack Of The Clones, Revenge Of The Sith, Solo: A Star Wars Story, Rogue One, A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back and Return Of The Jedi it's now time for The Mandalorian. It's supposed to be happening between Return Of The Jedi and The Force Awakens so it's only logical I watch it now. I do hope there will be much more seasons though as I just loved this show. Pedro Pascal is perfect as The Mandalorian. Each episode is quite short but very enjoyable to watch, certainly if you just watched all the other movies just before. It's a nice continuation of this saga. You can write whatever you want about the early movies in this saga, but the modern ones just beat them in everything, quality, acting, and technology, as so does this series. I binge watched the first season in 24 hours that's how good I thought it was. Next will be The Force Awakens but to be honest I can't wait to watch other seasons from The Mandalorian as it's for me the best thing in the whole Star Wars saga thus far.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1
The Mandalorian,"The Mandalorian Questions: Why does an expert bounty hunter who lives in his helmet need a monocular? Wouldn't his helmet be able to Robocop Zoom Vision? Also, why do droids need currency? And finally, why couldn't they make Episode VIII and Solo this good? This was only 39 minutes and was 10x more enjoyable than the last two Star Wars movies combined.Anyways, Episode I of THE MANDALORIAN (3½/5 Stars.) I have spoken.",1,1,1,1,1,1,0
The Mandalorian,"""The Mandalorian"" is one series that entertains with action and adventure and you can just feel the ""Star Wars"" atmosphere as the scenes and backdrops show the universe and many characters are noticeable set after the fall of the empire and before the rise of a new order in the republic the series follows the travels and life of one lone bounty hunter. The action and adventure keeps you glued and the discovery of one little cute pointy long eared green baby is a nice wild card and supporting theme for the series. Really good work from the ""Star Wars"" universe a must watch for the saga's fan base.",1,1,1,1,1,1,0
The Mandalorian,"There are a lot of impressive things about The Mandalorian, but what I love the most is the way it introduces fully three-dimensional characters with detailed backstories that are only hinted at in every episode, even though some are one-ofs and others only show up intermittently.That guy in the first episode who kept saying ""I have spoken,"" the love interest on that peaceful planet, that over-the-top knife thrower who knew Mando back in the day. You could spin any of them into a season's worth of episodes, but instead they're here and gone in a flash.That's how much work goes into each episode. This is detailed world, and yes, this world has been being built for decades which gives the series an advantage, but then, humans have been around for centuries and there are still lots of series with sketched-out characters.Also, first rate special effects, lots of exciting action, cool robots, mysterious hero with a personal code of honor that has a lot of gray areas, super cute critter with strange powers ... it's just all so good.If you like Star Wars, you definitely need to watch this. If you don't, watch it anyway, just to admire it's commitment to fleshing out its guest characters.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1
The Mandalorian,"Some good cinematography, other than that nothing about this show impressed me. and it did a horrendous job of getting me hooked or invested in the story. i was bored for most of the episode, and then the action scenes were just fine. i watched 4 episodes. i quit (1 viewing 1/2020)",1,1,1,1,1,1,1
Wonder Woman 1984,"It's 1984 in Washington, D.C. Diana Prince (Gal Gadot) fights crime as Wonder Woman. During the day, she works at the Smithsonian Institution where she befriends bumbling newcomer Barbara Minerva (Kristen Wiig). Diana is terribly lonely pining for lost love Steve Trevor (Chris Pine). The FBI needs Minerva to identify a stolen artifact which turns out to be a wishing stone. Diana wishes for Steve while Barbara wishes to be like Diana. Eager TV huckster Maxwell Lord (Pedro Pascal) has been searching for the stone and decides on an unusual wish.The movie feels too long. At two and a half hours, it's not the longest especially for a comic book movie. Nevertheless, it feels very long. While I like most of these premises, some of it could be cut back to speed things up. I don't really like Pascal hamming it up as a TV huckster. I'd rather have him be a simple Scrooge like figure. An evil businessman is a better foil. The actual businessman in the movie can be cut out. I'm also not sure about the logistics of the wishes. They need to be better thought out. A lot of this needs to be better thought out like the final turn. If the son is that final turn, he needs to be more prominent in his life. Overall, this movie just feels a little too long. Maybe it needs more jokes to pass the time. The action could be tightened. She could learn to fly quicker. Things could be done even if the running time remains the same.",0,1,-1,0,-999,0,0
Wonder Woman 1984,"The first film was a fantastic big screen debut for the DC Comics heroine, this was highly anticipated follow-up, the ninth officially in the DC Extended Universe. It has been delayed a number of times since late 2019, then the COVID-19 pandemic did so again, but I'm glad I finally got to see it, directed by Patty Jenkins (Monster). Basically, in her childhood, young Diana (Lilly Aspell) competed in a multistage athletic competition on Themyscira against older Amazons. She is disqualified for taking a shortcut during the competition; her mother, Queen Hippolyta (Connie Nielsen), and her aunt Antiope (Robin Wright) lecture her on the importance of truth. In 1984, decades after the First World War, Diana Prince (Gal Gadot) works as a senior anthropologist at the Smithsonian Institute in Washington, D.C. She also continues to fight crime as Wonder Woman. Diana meets new co-worker, Barbara Ann Minerva (Kristen Wiig), who is insecure, unnoticed by others, and tries to befriend Diana. Whilst researching ancient Mediterranean civilisations and antiquities, Diana is handed a mysterious Dreamstone, which seemingly grants wishes upon contact with any user. Both Diana and Barbara both hold the stone and are unknowingly granted their desires: Diana wishes for her deceased lover, Steve Trevor (Chris Pine), whose soul is transported into another man's body; Barbara wishes to be ""like Diana"", and slowly becomes beautiful, strong, and powerful. Maxwell Lord (Pedro Pascal) is a charismatic businessman and entrepreneur, but he is actually a fraud with a failing business. Lord visits the Smithsonian, it is clear that he knows the power of the stone and wants to get his hands on it. He manages to manipulate Barbara during a gala night at the institute in order to acquire the stone. He makes the wish to become the embodiment of the stone and gains its power. In doing so, he can grant one wish to a person, and take whatever he desires from them. Over the next few days, Maxwell rises to become a powerful influential figure, while leaving chaos and destruction. Diana is overjoyed to have Steve back in her life, and he is amazed by the many innovations of the future. But Diana realises that her wish has come at a price, as she is slowly losing some of her abilities. Barbara however embraces her newfound beauty and popularity and takes advantage of her strength and powers. Diana, Steve, and Barbara investigate the Dreamstone further, it is discovered it was created by the God of Treachery and Mischief. The stone grants a user their wish but takes their most cherished possession in return, and the only way to reverse the condition is by renouncing their wish or destroying the stone itself. Steve realises that his existence comes at the cost of Diana's power. Both Diana and Barbara are unwilling to renounce their wishes and try to figure out another solution. Maxwell is desperate to reach out to as many people as possible to grant their wishes and gain more money and power. He manages to get himself a meeting with the President of the United States (Stuart Milligan), who tells him about a satellite broadcast system that can transmit signals globally. Barbara, desperate to keep her power, is determined to stop Diana from harming Maxwell, and joins him as they travel to broadcast station that he will use to communicate to the entire world, offering to grant their wishes. Steve convinces Diana that she must let him go and renounce her wish, she reluctantly does so and regains her strength, and gains the ability to fly. She returns home and dons the armour of the legendary Amazon warrior Asteria, then heads to the broadcast station. She battles Barbara, who has made another wish with Maxwell, transforming her into apex predator creature Cheetah. After defeating Barbara, Diana confronts Maxwell, who has already communicated to millions of people who make their wishes. But Diana uses her Lasso of Truth to communicate with the world via him, convincing everyone to renounce their wishes, after realising the consequences. Maxwell is convinced to renounce his own wish after realising he will lose his son, Alistair (Lucian Perez). The world is eventually restored, and Maxwell is reunited with his son, telling him the truth about his fraudulent lifestyle. Sometime later, Diana is walking the streets during the Christmas holidays, and she meets the handsome man (Kristoffer Polaha) whose body Steve was inhabiting, and she continues to protect the world. In a mid-credit scene, Asteria (Lynda Carter, who famously played Wonder Woman on television) is revealed to be alive and living among humanity in secret, much like Diana. Also starring Amr Waked as Emir Said Bin Abydos, Natasha Rothwell as co-worker Carol, Ravi Patel as Babajide, Oliver Cotton as Simon Stagg, Gabriella Wilde as Raquel, Kelvin Yu as Jake, and Asim Chaudhry as co-worker Roger. Gadot remains perfect casting as the beautiful warrior princess, Pine is both charming and amusing as he discovers the 80s, Wiig who is normally comedic gives an interesting serious performance, and Pascal is pretty good as the power-hungry villain. I agree that it is little bit long, and the various storylines going on make it a bit messy, but you cannot help but be thrilled by the explosive chase and fight sequences, with fantastic special effects, and one or two good songs, including Frankie Goes to Hollywood, in the soundtrack, an entertaining superhero action. Good!",1,1,-1,1,1,1,1
Wonder Woman 1984,"I did actually enjoy the 2017 movie ""Wonder Woman"" quite a bit, so I was definitely looking forward to this 2020 movie from writers Patty Jenkins, Geoff Johns and Dave Callaham.And while ""Wonder Woman 1984"" was definitely a watchable movie, it just wasn't really up to par with the 2017 movie in anyway. Why? Well, simply because the storyline felt way too comical and the villains in the movie weren't really all that interesting or menacing.The storyline told in ""Wonder Woman 1984"" just fell short of being all that entertaining. Sure, it was a watchable movie, but it was hardly an outstanding or particularly memorable foray into the D.C. world of superheroes. For me, the storyline here felt like something that had been ping ponged around a breakfast table, with the writers just tossing out ideas and settling on something that seemed like something that could be made into a Saturday morning cartoon.Of course it was nice to have Gal Gadot return to portray Diana/Wonder Woman in this 2020 movie, and she was joined with talents such as Chris Pine, Kristen Wiig and Pedro Pascal. I must admit that Pedro Pascal's performance was actually the most brilliant and enjoyable in the movie, and his character was the one with the most appeal in the movie. Mind you, as a villain he just wasn't all there. I mean, it was more of an average Joe come into power situation, so it took away from the usual superpowered villain stuff you'd expect to see in a D.C. movie.For me, the whole granting wishes thing concept of the movie just felt out of place, and like something that belonged in a whole different type of movie. It just failed to captivate me, and proved to have little entertainment value in terms of being the focal point of a superhero movie.Visually then ""Wonder Woman 1984"" was all there, just like the 2017 movie was. So the visual effects team definitely worked their magic with this 2020 movie, no doubt about that.While I have now seen ""Wonder Woman 1984"" once, I doubt that I will be returning to watch it a second time, as the storyline just felt out of place and too weak for a movie for Wonder Woman.My rating of ""Wonder Woman 1984"", sadly, lands on a very mediocre five out of ten stars.",0,1,-1,0,0,1,1
Wonder Woman 1984,"I find this film long and boring. The build up take far too long, and scenes just drag on and on. It doesn't have the powerful touch of the original.",-1,0,-1,0,0,0,0
Wonder Woman 1984,"So I finally figured out why this movie is called Wonder Woman 1984. That's because it takes its inspiration from the pre-Marvel Cinematic Universe superhero movies that are adaptions of the comics in name only. I'm looking at you, Supergirl, which came out in 1984*.Yes, before superhero movies took over the world, we got movies like Superman IV: The Quest for Peace and the Spider-Man and Captain America TV movies (and Superman III and the Cannon Captain America too, while we're at it).In 1984, we were lucky if we got a great superhero film.In 2020, we forgot what that time was like.Directed by Patty Jenkins from a script she wrote with Geoff Johns** and Dave Callaham, based on a story by Johns and Jenkins, this is a movie that people have really hated with a passion. So many people have said that it's campy, but they really have no idea what that word means. This is in no way the 1960's Batman TV series. It's not Barbarella. We could only dream that it could be a tenth of a percent as campy as Danger: Diabolik or Flash Gordon***.It's the very definition of a movie that has no idea what it wants to be, the story that it wants to tell or how the characters will learn or grow along the way. It only hamfistedly smashes plot points - Honesty is good! Lies are bad! - with all the subtlety of Obnoxio the Clown.It all starts in the home of the Amazona, Themyscira, where a kid version of Diana Prince competes against the older Amazons and learns that cheating won't get her anywhere. This is generally called foreshadowing, but again, this is a plot point hammered home so completely that even Bizarro would find himself saying, ""Me not get it!""We move to 1984, sixty-six years after we last saw our heroine in the last movie, and she's spent the decades pining for Steve Trevor (Chris Pine), who sacrificed himself to save everyone from a bomber filled with poison. Now she's the senior anthropologist at the Smithsonian, working alongside the mousy Barbara Ann Minerva (Kristen Wiig) when she's not foiling robberies at malls that look so garishly 1980's that Nightwing's first costume would fit right in.Trust me. I was in the 1980's. I was eight when they started. Everything in here is exactly the 80's marketing people think the 80's are. Anachronism abounds to the point that I was expecting Rip Hunter to show up and ask Wonder Woman to fix things. ""Diana! Operation Wolf came out in 1987, not 1984! Per Degaton is ruining everything! The Cro-Mags didn't release The Age of Quarrel until 1986 and that kid already has the shirt! Cronos is destroying the time-space continuum! That man is walking a goldendoodle, which wasn't bred until 1990! Monarch is back!""That's when this film's McGuffin comes into play. The Dreamstone can give anyone their wish. Wonder Woman wants Steve back. Barbara wants to be Diana. And Max Lord (Pedro Pascal) wants it all.Yes, Max Lord. The guy who was behind the Justice League International before coming back to kill off Blue Beetle and ruin the DCU for so many people in Countdown to Infinite Crisis.While this isn't a mainstream character, it doesn't have to be. But the truth is, Wonder Woman 1984 is more Max Lord's movie than it is Diana's. He's the one that takes the journey, who changes and becomes a better person at the end once he sees where his bad decisions have taken him. And much like 1984, the year when comic book movies had nothing in common with their print inspirations, he's Max Lord in name only****. He's more Donald Trump than L-Ron's best pal, but that's completely intentional.Within a few days, Lord has pretty much ruined the world with wish after wish*****. Barbara has wished to become an apex predator, a term nobody used in 1984. And Diana has realized that Steve - in another man's body that had sex with Diana without consent, which was a major issue with so many people and something that while upsetting is also something fictional with no way of happening in our reality and to be blunt, we got bigger things to be upset about in 2020 - shouldn't be back from the dead.And that's pretty much it.The biggest sacrifice - Steve going back to death - is made by Steve more than Diana. Barbara never gives up her wish, gets electrocuted and still lives. And Max actually comes out as the person who learns the most, telling his son that he is not a good man.Maybe it's the amount of horror and exploitation films that I watch on a regular basis, but movies are best between 66 and 75 minutes. This one goes near double that and I already told you the whole story in a few paragraphs. It drags. And drags. And then drags some more for good measure.It also doesn't have any real reason to be set in 1984 other than the title and ""Welcome to the Pleasuredome"" by Frankie Goes to Hollywood getting used in one scene. And yes, to be completely OCD, this movie takes place on the Fourth of July and that song was released until October 29 of that year.It's also a $200 million dollar movie that has effects that feel unfinished (just look at the kids turn into obvious dummies when she saves them), a final fight scene that makes the end of Ang Lee's The Hulk look well lit and invalidates much of what we knew of Wonder Woman in Justice League, which claims that she was in hiding the whole time. As for those who claim continuity doesn't work, the old DCU was the most continuity heavy universe ever. Ask Ambush Bug. And continuity is a major reason why the MCU works so well.That said, Gal Gadot is fine as Wonder Woman, for all she is given to do. Kristen Wiig is playing Kristen Wiig and if you told me that this was the same character she was essaying in the Anchorman sequel, I would have believed you. And I guess Pascal is fine, but by the end of this movie, I was moved to ennui and struggling to say anything nice.I mean, go back and watch that fight scene in the mall. It has almost sitcom level mugging in it. I mean, the worst part for me was when Steve is amazed by an escalator and a subway train. The first movie was set in London during the First World War and all of those things existed there at that time. Maybe Steve is just a moron.There you go. I've spent more time figuring this movie out than it really deserved. Let's get back to Jess Franco movies, people.*But some really great comic films came out in 1984. One is based on a comic strip that not many people know called Sweet Gwendoline by John Willie and that would be the strangely great The Perils of Gwendoline in the Land of Yik Yak. The other two aren't based on any comic book but get the tone perfect and those would be The Adventures of Buckaroo Bonzai Across the 8th Dimension and The Toxic Avenger.**Who actually wrote some decent comics every once in a while, like DC's JSA.***Which is the answer to the question, ""What are Sam's two favorite comic book adaptions?""****Just like how its mentioned that the Dreamstone comes from Dolos, The Duke of Deception, who was the first major challenge that Diana faced pst-Crisis.*****One of those wishes is to get his company back from Simon Stagg, who we all know - I'm joking, like four or five of us know - is the father-in-law of Metamorpho.",-1,0,-1,0,-999,0,0
Wonder Woman 1984,"Greetings again from the darkness. Some of the key elements that make Wonder Woman appealing is that she's smart, she's nice, she's dedicated to doing good, she's grounded in her history, and her use of her powers makes sense (in a comic book kind of way). Most of that holds true in filmmaker Patty Jenkins' sequel to her 2017 blockbuster WONDER WOMAN. So why did that one work so well, while this one falls short? It's not an easy question to answer, though it could be as simple as having the wrong target.Gal Gadot returns as Diana Prince, and this time she's plopped into 1984 (the year, not the novel). This creates a cornucopia of opportunity for social commentary and satire from Ms. Jenkins and her co-writers Geoff Johns and Dave Callaham. After all, it was the era of atrocious popular music, outlandish fashion, and a relentless pursuit of greed by the ""me"" generation. The film pounces on each of these by using the return of Diana's main squeeze, Steve Trevor (Chris Pine), as a device for highlighting the absurdity of belly bags and pastel tank tops for men. In the first movie, the WWI pilot wakes up in Themyscira, and this time, he just kind of materializes in the year of GHOSTBUSTERS, shopping malls, and President Ronald Reagan. While this certainly qualifies as extreme culture shock, the parade of outfits and Steve's wide-eyed tour through the city are over-the-top, even for their attempted comedic effect.Over-the-top also describes the film's two main villains. Pedro Pascal (""Game of Thrones"") plays TV hypester and con man Maxwell Lord. He's a greedy, self-centered man willing to do anything to get ""more"". Kristen Wiig is Barbara Minerva, a bumbling, forgettable klutz who works at the same museum as Diana. She simply wants to be cool like Diana and have people acknowledge her existence. Things shift quickly thanks to the Dreamstone sitting in Barbara's in-box waiting for research. What follows is more than two hours of seeing the fallout of people having their wishes come true. If you've learned anything about human nature during this pandemic year, then you won't be surprised at how people react to gaining power.Maxwell Lord is not dissimilar to Lex Luthor in SUPERMAN (1978), as his goal is ultimate power and control - though to what end, he's not sure. Barbara Minerva was never really power hungry, but a taste of it was much to her liking, and she transitions to The Cheetah for Wonder Woman's biggest fight scene. There is also a message about what one sacrifices to have their wishes come true. This aspect of the film could be psychoanalyzed were one so inclined. Lord's relationship with his son is convoluted, and the early Barbara is a mess ... making their ""sacrifices"" a bit less obvious than that of Diana.The opening sequence is the one this viewer most enjoyed. Spectacular camera work takes us to a competition on Themyscira, as a very young Diana (Lilly Aspell returns) goes against the grown warriors, while Antiope (Robin Wright) and Hippolyta (Connie Nielsen) look on and teach hard life lessons. Not only do these actors return, but most of Ms. Jenkins' WONDER WOMAN crew is back, including cinematographer Matthew Jensen. The changes include Film Editor Richard Pearson and Hans Zimmer provides the new score. Some of the dialogue is tough to take. As an example, Diana says ""I don't know what to think, Steve. I only hope I'm wrong."" And later, Steve explains, ""Flying is easy. It's only wind and air."" Dialogue like this makes us want to renounce our own wishes. It may be one film later than it should have been, but Ms. Jenkins does deliver a much-appreciated cameo at film's end, and if nothing else, it leaves us wondering, 'what would you give up for a wish?'",0,1,0,0,0,1,0
Wonder Woman 1984,"... in that I can enjoy a good one, but film noir and precode are really my preferred genres. From that perspective, I don't think that this movie is nearly as bad as everybody says.There are big plot holes. Why is everybody wearing heavy coats and then suddenly it is the Fourth of July? Why is it OK to kidnap some random man's body from his life? Did he have a family who wondered where he was? Was he losing a job he wasn't showing up to? And how does a WWI pilot - the resurrected Steve - know how to operate a 1980s airplane? This last one is basically the same problem with Independence Day, a much worse movie that people apparently loved.In fact, reading the negative reviews, THAT is what I expected - Independence Day 2020. Hammy acting, over the top dialogue, shrill characterizations, and stuff that doesn't make sense on a much bigger scale than what I actually saw in this film. Maybe it is because people expected more action - this film is more philosophical. Maybe because folks expected more Wonder Woman in a movie that bears her name.About being philosophical, there was one thing I noticed, maybe it was intentional, maybe not. Pre magical powers, Max Lord is a greedy guy, but he is tethered to humanity through the unconditional love of his son. It is what ultimately brings him back from the brink. Kristen Wiig's character, Barbara, is a mousy timid person with zero confidence who was probably bullied as a child. Nobody ever helps her - even when she is being assaulted - unless they take pity on her. It wouldn't be because she means anything to them. When she gets the power to be like Wonder Woman she goes completely wild. For the first time in her life she has confidence and strength. And she is totally unconnected to humanity because nobody ever cared about her or even noticed she was alive, and so the feeling is understandably mutual. So she would die before she would give up that power and go back to what she was - a nobody. So think about that if you ever decide to bully somebody - adult or child. It has lasting consequences.Before all of this happened you would have said that Barbara is much more integrated into society than Max is. That's because she didn't have the strength or confidence to NOT be integrated into society.The Han Zimmer score was on point but not overpowering, the acting spot on. I think it is the large as well as smaller themes of the plot and the fact that the CGI seemed amateurish that people noticed. I noticed it. And I've always been a rather easy grader.",0,1,0,0,1,1,0
Wonder Woman 1984,"This movie has some really bad points. It isn't the worst action hero movie ever. It's 80% bad with some redeeming qualities here and there.
Firstly the bad points:
1. The story. This silly ""wish"" premise is weak and wears thin very fast. Be careful for what you wish for. Even a 1984 movie wouldn't have such a simplistic premise. It gets too overblown at the end. The writers really did a bad job. It's beyond low mentality and cliched. And things really fizzle out at the climax.
2. Long winded scenes. Many scenes could have been cut in half to keep the momentum going. From the overlong competition in the beginning, almost every scene could have been trimmed by a quarter.
The good points:
1. Gal Gadot is watchable and likeable - she could read the phone book and it would be watchable.
2. Pedro Pascal of Narcos is the villain here and he looks quite different - good that he has a big movie role.
3. Kristen Wiig has a remarkable transformation and her character is quite interesting.
4. Watch out for Lynda Carter.
The cast is good but they can't save a bad story. Chris Pine looks a bit haggard.
5. The production values are fine - it is a big budget movie. And the cinematography is good.They had better think carefully about who they get to make Part 3.",-1,1,-1,-1,0,1,1
Wonder Woman 1984,"I DO wonder what this would've been like an hour shorter.Much better! Wish granted!Wish wishes were true. Then I'd wish for more Wonder Woman in this Wonder Woman movie.

Wonder Woman, herself, is in this about 20 of 151 LONG minutes and there's even an hour and 21 minutes that pass without an appearance.But, that's not to say this was a bad movie. It was good, just...so...damn...long. It's the classic setup villains superhero sequel, like Batman Returns, only: every scene is probably 4-6 minutes past it's point. Everything drags when we already know where everything's headed.Wonder Woman somehow doesn't reappear into society until 1984 and after her latest appearance, she discovers an ancient rock that grants wishes. Diana (Wonder Woman,) her new friend and a con man get wishes and like they always say: Be careful for what you wish for.The movie starts off great, but then seems to completely slow down for the next 2 hours until a weird, but so-so final act that leaves me with a desire to never see this again. The end credit scene is worth it, but only if you already have HBOMax and you can fast forward to the end.That all said, it's not a complete waste and it IS worth watching once. The first Wonder Woman and Batman v Superman: The Ultimate Edition were WAY better. This is better than the theatrical cut of Justice League AS A MOVIE, but Wonder Woman was used much better there than in this film.This just should've been edited down more and we needed to see more of the main title character in the first follow-up sequel. That's what sequels are made for: doubling down on the first one. Here, it was half of the last one.***Final thoughts: At least we get to see the Mandalorian, a Ghostbuster, Captain Kirk and Wonder Woman all in one movie. There's a fanboy dream.",1,0,0,0,0,1,0
Wonder Woman 1984,"""At the end of 2020, here comes Jenkins' belated WONDER WOMAN sequel, thankfully Yours Truly is currently in China, where cinema remains open, and is able to watch its 3D version on the vast screen. WW 1984, its time-line is set among the Cold War nuclear hysteria, and our heroine Diana Prince (Gadot) does the usual superhero good deeds while remain certain degree of anonymity in Washington D.C.. Still pining for her lost lover, the WWI pilot Steve Trevor (Pine), she alights on a magical wish-granting gem, makes her wish and hey presto! Steve's soul is tossed back into our world (inhabiting another man's body, but in the eyes of his smitten beholder, he is the same old Steve all right), but soon it occurs to her that this miracle has a price to pay, the star-crossed lovers have to brave another adieu when Diana must choose to do the right thing, the emotional crunch is well-wrought, and Pine's soulful blue eyes are too irresistible to take our eyes off, and Gadot also passes muster to act out some real affect other than her acrobatic fighting showmanship.""read my full review on my blog: cinema omnivore, thanks",0,1,0,0,-999,0,0
The Midnight Sky,"It's 2049 in the Arctic Circle. A science station is being evacuated as an apocalyptic event spreads throughout the world. Augustine Lofthouse (George Clooney) is the only one staying behind since he has a terminal illness anyways. He is shocked to find a little girl left behind. Meanwhile, there is a spacecraft returning to Earth from an Earth-like moon orbiting Jupiter. The crew members are Sully (Felicity Jones), Adewole (David Oyelowo), Mitchell (Kyle Chandler), Sanchez (Demián Bichir), and Maya (Tiffany Boone). They are confused with their inability to contact Earth.This looks physically good but ultimately lifeless. In general, there are three stories being told. The flashback to young Lofthouse is rather unnecessary. It adds very little to his story. I assumed that Clooney may be trying to connect it with the little girl but that doesn't happen. The girl and Clooney hold the best part of the movie. The general premise doesn't make sense but if one ignores that, it actually works as a small adventure. There is no way that everybody would evacuate the base for certain doom. I just watched Greenland where people are killing each other for any small chance of a fractionally longer life. Having said that, one can ignore the flawed premise for the sake of the movie. That finally gets to the spacecraft section. It is the least compelling group. Clooney is doing a mix between Gravity and Steven Soderbergh's Solaris. He has great actors and wastes them with paper thin characters. It's a thriller trying to be thrilling and failing. It doesn't help that the ending is a story fading out to whatever. Only Clooney and the little girl serve as good movie material. Even there, the premise screws up the narrative.",0,1,-1,-1,-999,0,0
The Midnight Sky,"OK. What happened. This movie's first half is really engaging. As Augustine and the little girl make their way to transmitting station, it works very well. The bond that develops is sweet and yet terrifying. What happens next plays fast and loose with the first part. I wish we had some idea what happened to the earth. Then there's that space ship heading home and lots of superfluous stuff. Very slow but not really introspective. I'm disappointed in this.",-1,0,0,0,-999,0,-999
The Midnight Sky,"This movie was hyped pretty fairly up, so I must admit that I was expecting something more than what writer Mark L. Smith and director George Clooney managed to deliver.Now, I am not saying that ""The Midnight Sky"" was a boring or bad movie, but I just feel that the movie had the potential to have been so much more in both entertainment value and story. It felt like it was just the tip of the iceberg that was used to make the movie. And it was a shame, because the concept here definitely had a lot of potential.For me it was the prolonged uneventfulness that sort of put an anchor around the movie and held it back. The first two-thirds of the movie just trotted along with much of anything particularly impressive or overly entertaining happening. Sure, this was to establish the story and characters, but two-thirds? It just dragged on for a bit too long. And then the movie exploded into action, but ending as abruptly as it set into action, which left for much to be desired.The storyline was adequate and definitely had a lot to offer, but sadly weren't utilized to its full potential, making for a somewhat meager and mediocre movie experience. Sure, the movie was watchable, but it was not a movie that had me thrilled or impressed. Nor is it a movie that hardly warrants more than a single viewing for me.""The Midnight Sky"" definitely had an impressive assembly of casted actors and actresses, but sadly they weren't given space to spread their wings and showcase the full scope of their talents, given the limitations of the script and storyline.Visually then ""The Midnight Sky"" was definitely an impressive movie, but again there weren't a whole lot of things going on in the first two-thirds of the movie, but if you sit through the last third things definitely pick up.My rating of ""The Midnight Sky"" lands on a very mediocre five out of ten stars. A watchable movie for sure, but hardly an outstanding or particularly memorable movie experience.",0,1,0,0,0,1,1
The Midnight Sky,"The story is so minimal that almost nothing happens. At the end, a chatter said something that appears to be a twist, and I just don't understand anything about the film anymore.

The Midnight Sky,"It is the year 2049 and a disaster has devastated the Earth. An isolated observatory in the Arctic Circle is staffed by one, terminally-ill, scientist. He is determined to contact any off-planet travellers from Earth to warn them of the disaster and see if they can help. Little does he know but he has company.Directed by and starring George Clooney, this film had heaps of potential: the intrigue around the disaster, the scientist trying to get help, the crew of the space craft and their adventures. Clooney initially builds an interesting plot with some engaging characters.However, he doesn't know what to do with this solid foundation. Things get drawn out in the middle section - quite a few scenes that were unnecessary and just padding.There's still a chance that the film will go somewhere special but, unfortunately, it doesn't. The ending is quite the damp squib: largely predictable and unprofound.Disappointing.",-1,1,0,-1,0,1,0
The Midnight Sky,"Greetings again from the darkness. Screenwriter Mark L Smith has described his adaptation of Lily Brooks-Dalton's book, ""Good Morning, Midnight"", as a cross between the Oscar-winning GRAVITY (2013) his own THE REVENANT (2015, nominated for 12 Oscars). It's a lofty comparison, and unfortunately, one that doesn't prove out. Two-time Oscar winner George Clooney takes on the dual role of director and lead actor, and it's his first movie role since 2016's MONEY MONSTER.Clooney plays Dr Augustine Lofthouse, a renowned scientist, and the only one staying behind as everyone else evacuates the Arctic Observatory after some unspecified ""event"" as left the earth uninhabitable. Augustine has a terminal disease (also unspecified) and evidently decides to stay behind because he likes drinking alone and self-administering blood transfusions. The drinking alone fun ends when he ""finds"" a stowaway young girl named Iris (Caiolinn Springall in her first film) and must assume the role of father-figure. To complicate matters, Iris doesn't speak.It's 2049, and the film cuts between 3 storylines. While Augustine and Iris and working on a survival plan, we get flashbacks to a time when he was a younger scientist (played by Gregory Peck grandson Ethan Peck) and sacrificing a relationship with Jean (Sophie Rundle, ""Peaky Blinders"") to focus on his career. The third story occurs simultaneously with Augustine and Iris, and involves Aether, a manned spacecraft on a years long mission to determine if Planet K23 can be inhabited by humans. The crew is commanded by Adewole (David Oyelowo, SELMA), and includes his partner, a pregnant Sully (Felicity Jones, THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING), pilot Mitchell (Kyle Chandler, ""Bloodline""), navigator Sanchez (Demian Bichir, THE HATEFUL EIGHT), and rookie astronaut Maya (Tiffany Boone, ""Hunters"").When Augustine learns of Aether and its route back to Earth, he takes it as his responsibility to inform them that they need a new plan. In order to do this, he and Iris must trek across the frozen Arctic tundra through a blinding snowstorm to reach the satellite equipment that will allow communication with Aether. This road trip through a whiteout allows for the best effects during the Augustine/Iris section. Aboard Aether, the crew is relatively non-descript, but there is a spacewalk segment that is quite something to watch thanks to the cinematography of Martin Ruhe. There is also a visually interesting segment featuring blood in zero gravity.So what we have is a three-piece post-apocalyptic science-fiction space survival tale with a surprise twist that won't surprise anyone. It's likely meant as a warning about how we are destroying our planet, and global catastrophe may not easily be solved through space exploration. The film presents an interesting symmetry between the vast wasteland of Arctic winter vs the vastness of space ... neither seem to have borders or boundaries, yet are fraught with dangers. If you pay much attention to the story, you'll likely be disappointed; however, if you watch for the visuals, you should be fine.

The Midnight Sky,"There are shades of John Barry in Alexandre Desplat's suitably galactic score here, but that is, sadly, about all I can say that is good about this derivative sci-fi yarn. I think George Clooney did just about everything but make the coffee as his terminally ill character traverses the arctic wastes to reach a weather station. It might have a transmitter powerful enough to contact an approaching space craft returning from a distant planet that may offer hope for the survival of mankind from some sort of ghastly existential event threatening the world. The ship is manned by a crew including David Oyelowo and a pregnant Felicity Jones but their journey home is made even more perilous by being knocked off course and having to travel through uncharted space - full of dangerous meteor showers. Money has been spent; and it certainly looks good but the two stories don't really gel/relate very well; the characters are very under-developed and the plot is reminiscent of half a dozen other films of this genre where money was no object but poor writing, directing, and to be honest - acting too, wasn't part of the priority either. It's got way too many long beauty shots, spaceship shots, arctic shots - even gun shots - anything, really, to distract us from the lack of a new story. The imagery certainly benefits from a big screen, the rest - from being on the radio!",-1,-999,-1,-1,1,-1,1
The Midnight Sky,"It's no stretch to think that in 2049 an apocalypse has devastated earth. In an enjoyable The Midnight Sky, alone in the Arctic, astronomer Augustine (George Clooney) tries to contact a returning expedition to a habitable exoplanet to warn it not to return. In addition, he has to find someone to care for little stowaway Iris (Caolinn Springall) because he is about ready to die from a disease and there is no place like home anymore.Director George Clooney knows his way around a camera now with impressive set pieces like a blizzard and space ship repair, his way around the story not so much. The sentimental motifs are there including loves left behind, orphaned children, and flashbacks to simpler times.Clooney as actor is commendable: he underplays a scientist who sees the end coming near and accepts his terminal fate. He quietly warms to his little ward enough to try to save her, although, because she has maybe 2 lines, it's tough for the audience to identify with her.Clooney takes another minimalist approach about our destruction of the planet with a few damning lines about what a poor job we've done taking care of it. Hysterics about the lost world are few if any-the population readily abandons Earth for a newer world.The film fumbles a plot point or two when we become slightly confused about the lineage of two players. Having little Iris absent for the last part in order to emphasize other relationships is a loss, albeit this reviewer is an admirer of the minimalist approach to storytelling.Clooney and company channel the spirit of recent Sci-Fi's like Ad Astra, Gravity, The Martian, and Interstellar. Like them, most super hero films, and old E.T., going home is paramount. In the case of The Midnight Sky, it's a tough haul given our penchant for destroying that home.Let's just call it, like It's a Wonderful Life, a cautionary tale at holiday time.",0,0,-1,1,0,1,1

The Midnight Sky,"Greetings from Lithuania.More then once ""The Midnight Sky"" (2020) reminded me of ""Interstellar"" during its 1 h 50 min run time. Similar great idea, performances, craftsmanship. Yet I still prefer ""Interstellar"" way more, because its simply is the best science fiction ever made in my personal opinion.But back to ""The Midnight Sky"" - I found this movie very involving. I did not knew the story nor synopsis - and this story and the way it was told kept me engaged during its whole run time. I love good science fiction, and this movie is one of those. But at the center of everything most important things in this movie I think was its idea, and characters. Its hard to talk about them without spoilers, so I will not. The ending was surprising, and very touching and good. Sacrifices that one makes in order of something grater and last chance to say goodbye to ones we love and being with the during final moments I think its at core of this film. Great score, special effects and acting as well great directing. What a terrific film.",1,0,1,1,1,0,1
The Midnight Sky,"Like, there is a way of making a film in which absolutely nothing happens, and there is a way of doing it quite well. Samuel Becket and Harold Pinter were masters of the genre. George Clooney, unfortunately, isn't. Mind you, I'm not entirely sure if this is what he was trying to get at, but honestly, this movie was just really, really boring. In fact, for most of the time I was just willing it to end, and to end quickly. If there was a point in all of this, I really don't have any idea of what it was.Basically it is about this scientist in the arctic trying to contact this ship that was travelling to Jupiter to check out this planet to see whether it is habitable, but on the way the Earth basically destroys itself. The whole point is attempting to tell them to stay where they are because there is nothing for them to return to. And it is basically two entire hours of this. In fact, there are scenes that make absolutely no sense whatsoever, such as why does he leave the base only to return - there is no explanation, and no reason. Also what is the purpose of that girl he finds - she just seems to be there to provide a person to talk to, even though she doesn't say a word for the entire film.Honestly, I'm really going to have to stop watching these straight to Netflix films (though there is a suggestion that this was a theatrical release, so I'm really, really glad that I didn't go and see it in the cinemas). Yeah, in a way it is pretty bad, and my recommendation would be to save yourself two hours, even if you are doing something while it is playing in the background (you'll pretty much get the gist of the film watching it this way anyway, since much of it doesn't really make all that much sense) and watch something completely different - maybe four episodes of Ash vs The Evil Dead.",-1,0,-1,-1,-1,0,-1
The Midnight Sky,"While set in the future of 2049, ""The Midnight Sky"" seems a depressingly timely release for this pandemic year of 2020. The world is ending... in the movie, for reasons unexplained except that they were caused by man--global warming, nuclear holocaust, or any number of cataclysms of humanity's hubris. It doesn't really matter the exact event for the purposes of the picture, with the result regardless being one of character isolation and regret. George Clooney's scientist is confined to traveling between arctic radio bases, to stay in front of the poisonous air circling the world and to communicate with astronauts secluded in outer space. A lot of quarantining inside and otherwise wearing protective equipment to avoid breathing in the dangerous outside, in other words--sounds familiar, right.Apart from that, this is another Clooney space movie, with him directing as well as starring this time, and which is unfortunately closer to the ""Solaris"" (2002) remake than it is to ""Gravity"" (2013) (I haven't seen ""Tomorrowland"" (2015) yet). It's derivatively competent, but hardly of the import that its big-budget apocalyptic and planet-hopping scenario demands. Playing with memory is promising material, and this is reflected in space by the virtual-reality programs that remind the astronauts of home and on Earth by the scientist's flashbacks. It's readily cinematic: the film-within-the-film virtual reality and the flashbacks necessitating montage. The space mission and the one on Earth further reflect each other even in the space walk and the earthbound journey through snow-swept landscapes. Remembrance and regret is also intertwined with the dying planet and, perhaps, that of the human species (at least, one presumes, without biblical levels of inbreeding). But, it's been done better before in other space-related pictures, such as, say, ""Arrival"" (2016), or the original ""Solaris"" (1972). Moreover, it's disappointing that these recollections don't amount to much more than forgiving a man for abandoning his daughter.",-1,0,0,0,-999,0,0

Soul,"Some people may get annoyed when they hear ""another Pixar classic"". And I really try to avoid the term classic, especially with a movie that was just released. How can it already be a classic. Doesn't it have to stand the test of time? And how does Pixar actually achieve what they're doing? How can they keep this up with almost all their output. Even their ""weak"" movies are good by any measure.But this isn't just good! This is epic! Yes I went there! And not just because it is the flavor of the month. I won't bash Wonder Woman 84, even if I feel similar to some who have already seen it - the fact I probably have to wait at least a few weeks until it is officially released in Germany won't make a difference to the criticism: I do believe that it is more effects and show than substance ... but not everyting can be entertaining and so full of Soul like ... Soul/Pixar movies in general.But back to this, which starts off slowly in a way. You may feel differently when you start watching it, especially considering what they do with the ""music"" from the start. But considering all the places this movie takes you (literally and not) ... just wow.And it is about so much! That not just an animated movie can and does go there ... it's incredible. Of course those familiar with Japanese Anime in particular and Studio Ghibli in particular already know this is possible. Don't be offended if you are one of those, if people just start recognizing this and are blissfully unaware of this other world you were aware of aleady. Educate them if you want, don't belittle their experience or the one they get from this or other Pixar efforts.Having said all that and as you can see, I am not going into the story itself. For one I don't like to spoil, but also in this case, it is not so much about the apparent goal of our hero. It is about life itself. Again this is as deep as an animated (kids) movie can go. I can not praise enough what they have done here and how they achieved it. There is still silly humor and other things that make this entertaining. And that balance is finely tuned and mixed. A heartfelt story that I would assume almost everyone can connect with! And that is what makes the Pixar experience so unique - most of the times that is! It is not ""oops they did it again"" anymore - it's ""of course this is a Pixar movie and it is awesome!"".",1,0,1,1,0,0,1

Soul,"Pixar never ceases to amaze me. Somehow they've cracked this incredible code which allows them to have profound stories woven in such a way even kids can enjoy. They've found this perfect blend of tapestry which appeals to kids and adults alike. It's remarkable.Joe Gardner (Jamie Foxx) was a middle school music teacher with an eye on his big break. He believed he was born to play jazz and if he could do that for life he would be a happy man. His mother (Phylicia Rashad), on the other hand, thinks Joe should find steady work and stop chasing this dream.Joe finally got his big break when he was asked to fill in for an absent piano player. He crushed his rehearsal and was given the gig right there on the spot. In his jubilation Joe stepped into an open manhole and the next thing we see is a blue, roundish, figure of Joe on a conveyor belt going to ""the Great Beyond."" This couldn't have been a more inopportune time for Joe as he just got his big break.He found a way to stave off the Great Beyond with the help of some other souls--namely Number 22 (Tina Fey). Number 22 is a disembodied soul who never lived because she never found her ""spark."" If Joe can help her find her spark and get her soul patch (not the facial hair) then maybe he can go back to Earth and play in the gig of his life.""Soul"" is funny, insightful, and profound. I thought it wouldn't be as enjoyable once I saw the ""souls"" and the other entities in the netherworld Joe was in. They were of such a cartoon quality that I assumed the story would take on a cartoon quality as well. Thankfully, that was never the case. Yes, the movie had funny moments as it should have, but it never was silly. And even when we got the requisite pensive moment, it wasn't sad or depressing.

Joe (Jamie Foxx voice)Joe, the hero of Pixar's stunning animation, didn't know that about life until he took the journey in Disney Corporation's Soul. Affirming the everyday business of life and finding one's purpose in that state are what this warm and insightful animation is about, without emphasizing the theme too much or speechifying too obviously.At the beginning, Joe is faced with a decision to accept a full-time middle-school band directorship or play jazz with a well-known singer and her combo. Only when he experiences the end of his life where he should join the quiet line to walk into the Great Beyond does he experience in the Great Before the chance to find his spark of life and his purpose in that life.""It's the Great Before. This is where new souls get their personalities, quirks and interests before they go to Earth."" Counselor JerryWith the assistance of 22 (Tina Fey), who is developing her personality like other small ones in that middle ground, Joe learns to appreciate the small things like a piece of pizza and a small leaf. Armed with that new perception, he is ready to identify his purpose in life.Not one frame of this dynamic polemic is dull, for Pixar's directors, Rick Docter and Kemp Powers, feed endless creative space with characters and sights appealing to a child's love of color and an adult's longing for full-range visuals like lined figures and puffball kids.

Soul,"From the writer-director of Monsters Inc, Up & Inside Out comes another original, ambitious & heartwarming delight that piques the mind and stirs the emotions in ways only the best Pixar films can. An arresting & endearing trip to the afterlife & back, Soul is an affectionately crafted, passionately told & sumptuously animated gem that presents its pioneering studio in splendid form.Co-written & directed by Pete Docter, just like his earlier efforts, the story tackles existential themes but in a fun, accessible & enlightening manner, and also marks Pixar's first attempt to portray African-American life & culture on their rich, warm & distinctive canvas. As often is the case, the characters are scripted with genuine care & heartfelt compassion while the world building is sensible yet breathtaking.First-rate animation is pretty much a default setting when it comes to Pixar films and their latest picture is no exception, for every frame is immaculately rendered and the details are jaw-dropping. Also noteworthy is the ideal lighting, clever wit & swirling score that keeps the tone & vibe in sync. Still, when considering the so many interesting places the film journeys into, the final act feels surprisingly safe & predictable.Overall, Soul is another fascinating blend of emotional storytelling & spellbinding animation from Pixar and delivers all the perks & delights that we expect from the exceptionally creative powerhouse. Pete Docter has now smashed four home-runs in a row and even if his latest may seem like his weakest entry so far, it promises a rewarding time & delivers the desired goods.

Soul,"I do enjoy a movie based around puns, and ""Soul"" is about a Jazzcat who literally becomes a feline focused on playing jazz at a nightclub and about soul music involving spiritual mind-body dualism. That's my preferred eye-rolling examination of the arbitrariness of meaning--not the sophomoric philosophizing on the meaning of life and death that occupies much of the rest this ""Soul.""It's also the first Pixar movie to feature an African-American protagonist, although it took 23 features to do it--five more than the Marvel Cinematic Universe but much fewer than for parent-company Disney (unless one counts ""Song of the South"" (1946), but nobody does, not even Disney). Yet, that's only to put a white voice (Tina Fey) in the black body for much of the runtime as if it were some sort of light, cartoon treatment of ""Get Out"" (2017), or with the blue bodies of the souls, a reverse ""Avatar"" (2009), and to put the black actor's voice (Jamie Foxx) in a non-human animal. To most of the picture's world, his voice is even taken away as a result.Even for a long cartoon, ""Soul"" seems particularly silly to me and more religious, albeit of a goofy sort, than usual. On the other hand, the computer animation looks good, per usual of Pixar, including a cubist-inspired afterlife (or pre-life, I guess). I suppose the theme of confusion and lack of control of one's body may have some resonance with children audiences, but Pixar already did that with personified emotions in ""Inside Out"" (2015). The narrative emphasis on music in ""Soul,"" however, which corresponds neatly with the importance of scores in these animated pictures, raises this one up some.

Tenet,"The Protagonist (John David Washington) is a CIA operative. He is captured during an operation in Ukraine. He is able to eat a cyanide pill. He wakes up and gets recruited to fight a new cold war. Someone in the future is using inverted entropy to affect events in the past. He and Neil (Robert Pattinson) start investigating zeroing in on former Russian oligarch, Andrei Sator (Kenneth Branagh), and his abused wife Kat (Elizabeth Debicki).Christopher Nolan obviously has a thing about time. Memento happens to be one of my favorite films of all time. He is attacking it with all of his filmmaking skills and it is an attack from the editing, the sound mix, the plot, to the structure of the movie. First thing I noticed is that Nolan is relentlessly pushing the pace with every bit of filmmaking. The sound mix is like a heartbeat driving the movie whenever it goes into action mode. The editing is crisp and head-snapping. This is his transport plane deliberately driven into a constructed fake building. He's driving the movie into a fake building and not letting the audience the time to ruminate about the logic of the premise.In the end, that's its biggest flaw. The premise is out there and it's hard to keep track of the plot after the turn. The first part is a movie of one thing after another. When it gets to Kat, it finally tries to establish a connection with the characters. The fun part is the backward action moves but the logic of this premise keeps bugging me. For example, why is he trying to shoot himself in the past? Thinking about it after the fact leaves one with more questions and questions about the questions. The good part is that the relentless great action makes it impossible to dislike. The backwards action is just fun and different. That's plenty good enough.",1,1,-1,1,1,0,1
Tenet,"""Tenet"" is the newest movie by British Oscar-nominated filmmaker Christopher Nolan, who is widely considered among the most defining and visionary film directors these days, also because he writes his own screenplays. He had his 50th birthday this year and as a gift for his fans, there is a new movie out and here we have it. It runs for 2.5 hours exactly pretty much and I must say sadly that this is among my least favorites from the Oscar-nominated director. I wonder if he will ever win one. Probably, but I can't see it happen for this film here. I also struggled a bit with his previous movie ""Dunkirk"" three years ago, but there I thought it was maybe partially because war films were never my favorite genre. But this one here, in the widest sense, has parallens with ""Inception"" and that is a film I really appreciated, more with each viewing, but then again, maybe I need to watch this one also once or twice in the future and maybe I will appreciate it more. I just cannot say I am motivated at all right now. This also has to do with the cast. Or at least with lead actor John David Washington, who is strangely enough not even close to being first credit here on imdb. I also felt that on his big breakthrough film by Spike Lee that almost had him nominated for an Oscar, he was not particularly good, so I still do not really see any lead actor potential in him. This movie here definitely did not change my mind. Then again, Nolan's films are almost always more about the magic of the story and the scientific aspect partially even, the other production values too, and not necessarily about really deep and meaningful characters. It is the case here again. Robert Pattinson is another good example. I definitely think he received a lot of unfair criticism for Twilight and he has been (unlike Lautner) in several good films in the last decade since these vampire films and given strong performances too. He is definitely an option for an Oscar nomination in the near future. But for this film here he felt almost completely wasted. I mean he had a lot of screen time, but barely any significance. The one who stood out a bit in terms of performances here was Kenneth Branagh showing us that he can play a Russian brute very well too. Talented actor and filmmaker without a doubt and his rough take on the role made his relationship with Debicki's character the most interesting component of the entire film perhaps. Debicki did what she had to do I would say, but she never really stood out either. Oh yes, Nolan regular Michael Caine, who is closing in on 90, gets his one scene as well again basically talking to the protagonist relatively early on just like it was the case with ""Inception"" too for him. No material to shine at all though. That's pretty much it with the cast. More familiar faces and names too for sure, but nobody really outstanding.As for the story, you are thrown right in the middle of it all with the concert hall scene. It is tense and brutal, but for me it was too fast and I would have preferred a little more introduction and explanation here. Let's be honest. If you did not know who the protagonist was, simply because JDW is kinda famous (like him or not), it would have felt even more pointless. The idea of the suicide pill being just a test is an interesting one though and also kinda makes sense that it was all staged because, let's be honest, the ""bad guys"" must be utter fools to let such a severely suffering prisoner give his pill to another one caught by them. Still, this was to me the first moment and inclusion that felt good. A lot of the story about travelling back in time, like literally physically back in time felt not depicted in a way where it convinced me. If we are gentle, we could say that Nolan's mind is still too great to make sense to general audiences, but if not, we could also say that his idea here was not good and interesting enough and more for the sake of being genius than actually being genius and that also a lot got lost in translation. I did like the really simple introduction scene to the concept though at the shooting range between the scientist and the protagonist. This was nice. But when they extended this concept to humans and a plot that is about saving the world, then it did not win me over unfortunately. Oh well, like I said, maybe I need to watch it again. Also the final moment between Washington's and Pattinson's characters where we find out they knew each other for a lot longer did not make much of an impact to me. At least not as much as I hoped because this beautiful friendship was supposed to be shown as one of the more emotional twists this film has to offer. I would say that judging from the absense of audible reactions from the crowd during my showing that most others were not really that impressed either. Or maybe I am being too harsh here and really need to rewatch to see if the one reviewer on the front page here is correct by saying that it feels like nothing special on the first viewing, but pretty great on rewatch. Still not motivated though and besides, I rarely tend to appreciate a movie more on television or a small screen than at a movie theater and I will definitely not go again as long as it is shown right now. The only reason that could kinda get me to would be Branagh's performance. Here Nolan proves again for me that he may not really be the best when it comes to truly emotional aspects away from action sequences. I am mostly talking about the talk referring to the female protagonist's son. Like when we hear from one character the world will be destroyed and then Debicki's character says something like that would mean her son dies too. A bit on the cringe side. I am kinda glad they did not elaborate more on a potential romance relationship between her and JDW's character because then things could have gotten really messy. The one scene with the talk about Branagh's antagonist character thinking they could have sex was enough already. Speaking of him, he also talks on one occasion about holes in the neck and what to fill them with. Okay, that was rough. And almost a bit of cult like from a Tarantino movie (where we indirectly could have seen it depicted on the screen even). I won't deny it. Rough, but entertaining. What you think about the terminal disease plot that got revealed later on and as a consequence about Branagh's character developing some kind of god complex is up to you. I thought it was right, but like I said, I believed almost everything about Branagh's character and performance here. It's okay if you think it was too much. The one thing I would not be okay with though is really people saying that this was a magnificent movie or (one of) Nolan's best. I thought it was too much on the underwhelming side for a positive recommendation even and I genuinely hope that the filmmaker can improve again with his upcoming projects. I mean he may have another 30 years in the industry and I refuse to believe that ""Tenet"" (spelled Tenet backwards too, definitely not a coincidence) and ""Dunkirk"" will be on the same level as everything he has coming up in the future or at least I don't want to believe. No need to challenge your audience this much, Chris, sometimes less is more. How about an animated movie for once?",0,0,0,1,0,0,1

Tenet,"There are elements of Christopher Nolan's Tenet that has been inspired by other sources. 12 Monkeys, La Jetée, The Red Dwarf episode called Backwards, Steven Moffat's Doctor Who stories featuring River Song.Stripped of its gimmick of inverted time. It is basically John Le Carre's The Night Manager. Elizabeth Debicki appeared in the television adaptation and basically plays a similar character in Tenet.The Protagonist (John David Washington) teams up with sidekick Neil (Robert Pattinson) to stop Russian oligarch Sator (Kenneth Branagh) who has found a way to send a destructive weapon back from the future.In this temporal war, the Protagonist needs to get to Sator via his estranged wife Kat (Elizabeth Debicki.)The inverted backward effects are eye dazzlingly conveyed. Nolan once again goes for an expensive high concept James Bond type set pieces.However the various going ons in the story is confusing. Not helped by terms such as Time Inversion, Temporal Pincer movement. I found the trick is to follow the forward narrative of Neil and not be confused by the The Protagonist's stories.Tenet is an enjoyable funfair ride. However I also felt that it was something you would quickly forget as you do not want to spend a lot of time thinking about it.

Tenet,"Now this movie really begs of you to listen, to watch and to be there for the whole thing. You can get not just the just of it in one viewing, but you can understand it - although as the movie itself tells the protagonist, sometimes it is ok to just ""feel it"". And that is something you most certainly can do. Anyone can do that.One thing I would recommend (if you like the genre that is of course, because if you're not open to this mind bender, than you're wasting your time anyway), is to watch this on the biggest screen possible. The best way to watch this is apparently the BFI in London (IMAX). That is of August 2020 speaking, there are cinemas being build even during the pandemic, one in the south of Germany, which has as a goal to be the biggest screen worldwide. Now just check where an Imax is and if you can attend to a screening there. Otherwise just choose another screen, but try to watch it in cinemas. Hopefully you're not too afraid because of Corona and your cinemas are still open and do everything they can to be safe.Talking about safe. That is one of the goals of our main protagonist. Even if he doesn't know it yet - or maybe he does? Is it complex? For sure and that's a good thing. While driving to the cinema (Imax) we watched this at (with a couple of friends), we got into traffic and were a bit late. So we did miss the first couple of minutes and were told of them. Not just because of that I will watch it again. And yet I still got it. I would even say that if you've seen the odd movie here and there, you will be able to know certain things (""twists"" or revelations).I can not stress out enough how visually amazing this is, but we knew that of Christopher Nolan. The sound design is amazing too, soundtrack heightens everything - and the acting is top notch. Now one of the points I felt was not done very well, was the ""sailing"" scene. You almost couldn't understand them at all. Most of the other stuff wasn't that bad. But again and as said before twice: you've got to feel it - so do you feel it?",1,0,1,1,1,1,1
Tenet,"This film was originally intended to be released in mid-July 2020, but was delayed to 31 July, until finally being released in August, this is due to the COVID-19 pandemic causing all cinemas to close during the lockdown. I saw the five minute footage trailer back in March, and I was most interested to see it on the big screen, so thank goodness cinemas eventually reopened (with guidelines and safety measures), and I went to see this. The dictionary definition of ""tenet"" is ""any opinion, principle, doctrine, dogma, etc., especially one held as true by members of a profession, group, or movement"", I just knew it was a blockbuster that loads of people, including me, were keen to see, written and directed by Christopher Nolan (Memento, Insomnia, The Dark Knight, Inception, Dunkirk). Basically, an unnamed Protagonist (John David Washington, Denzel's son), a CIA agent posing as a Ukrainian policeman, participates in an undercover Russian operation to steal an unidentified object during a terrorist siege on an opera house in Kyiv. During the chaos, the Protagonist is saved by a masked gunman using time-reversing technology. The Russians turn on the CIA members and torture the Protagonist, but he bites a suicide pill before to avoid revealing any information. The Protagonist wakes, learning that the pill was fake, and that all his team members were caught and killed by the Russians, and they have got the unidentified object. The Protagonist is recruited into a secret organisation seeking to track down the origin of ""inverted"" objects, which move backward through time, using future technology sent back into the past. Investigating inverted bullets, the Protagonist is assisted by Neil (Robert Pattinson) to infiltrate the compound of an arms dealer, Priya (Dimple Kapadia). She directs them towards Russian oligarch Andrei Sator (Kenneth Branagh). To reach Sator, the Protagonist approaches Sator's wife Kat (Elizabeth Debicki). The Protagonist experiences the inverted technology during an operation, involving a plane crashed the storage facility in Oslo Airport, where he fights a regular masked man. Neil unmasks and releases his opponent, then stops the Protagonist from killing the inverted opponent, who escapes. Priya explains that the facility contained a time inversion device. Kat arranges for the Protagonist to meet Sator, who the Protagonist saves Sator from Kat's murder attempt. Sator reveals that information sent from the future had contributed to his wealth. The Protagonist offers to steal the object that Sator had been seeking, in exchange that Kat will be freed. After the Protagonist and Neil steal the object from an armoured car in transport, an inverted Sator confronts them, holding Kat hostage to obtain the object. Neil calls in the secret organisation's time-inverting troops to assist. Time inversion devices are used by Sator and the Protagonist and they battle for possession of the object, with Sator ultimately prevailing; and Kat is severely wounded with an inverted bullet. To save Kat from death, the Protagonist and Neil join her in inverted time, but they require the device in Oslo Airport to un-invert in the past. They infiltrate the airport, using the plane crash as a distraction: the masked man the Protagonist previously encountered was actually his future self. The un-inversion is successful. Priya explains that the crucial object is part of a future-developed ""algorithm"" capable of catastrophically inverting the entire world. The algorithm was sent into the past to prevent its use in the future, leading to human extinction from climate change. Kat reveals Sator's motive: he is dying from inoperable cancer and believes that the world should die with him. Sator has the algorithm and travels to a time in the past when he was most happy, where he plans to die peacefully and activate the algorithm. He is followed by Kat and the time-inverting secret organisation. Kat will delay Sator's death in Vietnam, while troops attack a Soviet closed city to retrieve the algorithm. Kat kills Sator prematurely, but the Protagonist and Neil retrieve the algorithm in time. During the retrieval, the Protagonist is saved by a masked corpse who springs back to life inverted. The organisation plans to separately hide the algorithm's components. As Neil and the Protagonist part ways, Neil reminisces about their long partnership, revealing that the future version of the Protagonist had recruited Neil in Neil's past. The Protagonist notices that Neil has a red string on his backpack, like that who saved him in the opera house. Neil insists he must continue his mission, intending to invert time. In London, Priya attempts to kill Kat to tie up loose ends. Instead, the Protagonist kills Priya, and implies that a future version of himself will be the mastermind behind all of the secret organisation's actions. Also starring Aaron Taylor-Johnson as Ives, Himesh Patel as Mahir, Michael Caine as Michael Crosby, and Fiona Dourif (Brad's daughter) as Wheeler. Washington is reasonable as the lead, Pattinson is fine, Branagh is suitably hammy as the villain, and there is almost point in Caine being in the film, being in a single and very short scene. A character asks, ""Does your head hurt yet?"" to another, that is exactly the feeling you are going have watching this film. You cannot deny that the special effects, editing, and sound design are fantastic to make spectacular scenes with explosions, gunfire and crashes seen reversing and going forward, sometimes in the same scene. The problem is, it is pretty much impossible to try and work out what the hell is going on, it is trying to be too clever that it almost forgets about the audience watching. It's not quite what I had in mind as the first film to watch returning to the cinema, lol.

Tenet,"A CIA agent is given an unusual assignment: track down the source of inverted bullets, bullets that move backwards through time. This will hopefully lead him to the source of entropy-reversal technology from the future.Christopher Nolan is one of my favourite directors, with Memento ranking, for me, as the second greatest movie of all time. Being written and directed by him you know it is going to be clever and complex.Here, however, he lays on the complexity but fails to make it entirely understandable. Twists and cleverness just for twists and cleverness sake. Throw in the fact that the dialogue often gets drowned out by the loud, droning, this-is-a-key-moment-so-needs-loud-music score (a trick Nolan picked up in Dunkirk, where we had that irritating droning sound throughout the movie) and the plot is difficult to follow. At a point I gave up trying to understand the concepts behind the plot, or follow the plot itself, and just went along for the ride.In addition to being not entirely comprehensible, the film is more an action movie than an intelligent thriller. It has many traits of a Bond film: jet-setting locations, find A to get to B to get to C with the slimmest links between the different parts in the chain. This all an excuse for some outlandish scheme or action sequence. Plus the villain has the opportunity to quickly kill the hero several times but chooses not too - very Bond-like. Add in the perfectly-choreographed action sequences, many big, bright explosions and it's more style than substance.This said, it is reasonably enjoyable. The action sequences are well done, it moves at a great pace and doesn't feel like a 2.5-hour movie.Performances are pretty solid, especially from John David Washington (in the lead role) and Elizabeth Debicki. Kenneth Branagh does his best fake Russian accent and seems every inch the Bond villain. I have never liked Robert Pattinson, thanks to that Twilight crap, but was hoping here he could prove he had some decent dramatic acting skills. Sadly, no, he doesn't.More style than substance, and below Christopher Nolan's usual standard, but reasonably entertaining.",0,1,-1,0,-1,1,1
Tenet,"The protagonist(John David Washington, a great lead) is recruited to stop a major threat. I won't reveal more detail than that. Thankfully, he won't have to face it alone. He'll be working with Neil(Robert Pattinson, all charm and wit). Hypothetically, if he had other allies, I would not give away here who they are. I won't reveal the exact nature of the role of Kat(Elizabeth Debicki, somehow matching her work in Widows. Covering a lot of the emotional spectrum). But I will say that, if I didn't love everything about this(don't get me wrong, I absolutely do), honestly, even if, in fact, I *hated* every single other thing about this movie, it would still be worth watching for her performance and presence alone. They are up against a formidable threat: Sator(Kenneth Branagh, very sinister). Can they possibly save the world?The director continues to master spy movies. In some ways this is James Bond with a mindbending sci-fi twist. Nolan has returned to the heights of quality of The Prestige, The Dark Knight and Inception. It has the best and biggest action set pieces of his career, and it's the most visually compelling. Even for him, this is incredibly complex. It won't be enough to pay close attention and try carefully to figure everything out while watching. You'll have to go over everything afterwards. It may take multiple viewings. I won't claim I understand everything in this yet.This pushes the PG-13 rating, and contains a lot of exploration of abuse, some deeply disturbing violence(even though it is more hinted at than clearly shown), and a little bit of strong language. I recommend this to every fan of anyone working on this, with the obvious caveat that I would not want for anyone who fears for their safety in a theatre due to Covid to risk harm to themselves or those around them. 10/10",1,1,0,1,0,1,1
Tenet,"Following a muddlesome terrorist attack on an opera, this unnamed chap (who I shall call Z) is introduced to the phenomenon of inversion. Inversion is the reversal of entropy, and can be applied to an object, a location, one or more individuals etc. This means that time can run forwards and backwards at more or less the same time in more or less the same place. It is dangerous: if overused it can overbalance entropy, which will end everything. And a nasty Russian piece of work is trying to collect bits of a mechanism so that he can activate an algorithm...Christopher Nolan's latest follows Inception and interstellar and, if you thought they were difficult to understand and follow, you ain't seen nothin' yet.Inversion is a great maguffin. The problem here is that in order to follow the story, you need to have an understanding of how inversion works, and that's exactly what you don't get here. In fact a lady scientist early on says ""Don't try to understand it, just accept it,"" and this is effectively writer/director talking to the viewer. I think this is code for him saying ""I haven't really thought this through completely, so don't expect it to make sense."" Given that it has taken him years to write this...There are various problems. Given that you have time running backwards and forwards at the same time, it's fair to generate an element of ""What's going on?"" to be answered when a reverse-time sequence unfolds in positive time back to its start at the end. But what I just said gives some indication of how preplexing the film is when much of it is told that way. A number of IMDB reviews say it was gibberish on first viewing, made sense on second viewing. My opinion is that you shouldn't have to see a film twice for it to make sense, especially if it takes a frustrating two and a half hours to watch it once.The next problem is that dialogue is mumbled and buried under general noise, making it nearly impossible to hear very necessary exposition.I'm not going to go on about this film which would have been a great deal better if it had been a great deal simpler, and which would have benefitted from Nolan having a co-writer on board to act as the viewer's friend. This film is NOT the greatest thing since sliced bread. I give it 5 out of 10, which is what happens when a 10/10 positive entropy maguffin meets an inversed 0/10 script.",-1,-999,-1,0,-1,-999,0

National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation,"National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation (1989) *** (out of 4) The third film in the series has Clark (Chevy Chase) deciding to stay home and instead of going anywhere he invites all the family over for the holidays and sure enough nothing goes right. I must admit that I enjoyed the previous two films more than this one but there's still enough laughs here to make this one well worth seeing. I think the film certainly has some flaws in it but when there are so many laughs you really can't complain too much. I think Chase is in fine form as he goes more over-the-top here than in the previous installments. He's so wild here that at times he seems like he's playing a cartoon character. This certainly isn't a bad thing as Chase can handle this type of comedy but there were a few too many slapstick scenes early on. I think what really makes this film so memorable is the terrific supporting cast. Beverly D'Angelo is just fine as the supporting wife but we get terrific work from Diane Ladd, E.G. Marshall, Juliette Lewis, John Randolph, William Hickey, Brian Doyle-Murray, Julia Louis-Dreyfuss and Mae Questel. The stand out however has to be Randy Quaid returning as Cousin Eddie. The actor really does a terrific job bringing this character to life and the comic timing is just flawless no matter what he's doing.

By the time all of the old-timers show up, it does start to get bogged down a bit, although the film is enlivened by the presence of Randy Quaid's enjoyably scuzzy cousin and there are some hilarious scenes like the turkey carving.Occasionally, and especially towards the end, Christmas VACATION descends into schmaltz, but then that's down to John Hughes who can never resist inserting some sentimentality into his work (it's even there in my favourite of his films, PLANES, TRAINS & AUTOMOBILES, although John Candy is so sympathetic that it works). Chase and D'Angelo are on top form here and the film as a a whole is difficult to dislike as it has so much energy and so many constant gags. Watch out for a fresh-faced Juliette Lewis in one of her earlier performances.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation,"Clark Griswold (Chevy Chase) drag his wife Ellen (Beverly D'Angelo), daughter Audrey (Juliette Lewis) and son Rusty (Johnny Galecki) to get a Christmas tree. It's the start of a season of ridiculous family celebration. Clark doesn't get along with his yuppie neighbors, the Chesters (Nicholas Guest, Julia Louis-Dreyfus). Clark's parents (John Randolph, Diane Ladd) and Ellen's parents (E. G. Marshall, Doris Roberts) join them. Ellen's cousin Catherine (Miriam Flynn), her idiot husband Eddie Johnson (Randy Quaid) and their family pay a surprise visit. Clark desperately needs the year-end bonus from his boss Frank Shirley (Brian Doyle-Murray) to cover a cheque for the pool but he only gets a Jelly of the Month Club.There are a lot of random Christmas jokes. Some of them actually do hit well. However Chevy's shtick was getting tired at this point. Beverly D'Angelo is fine as always. The grandparents are more annoying than funny. The movie misses a great opportunity to give them some personality and depth. Honestly, I couldn't tell them apart. I don't know who are who's parents. The sets of parents could fight against each other over the kids or how Clark is doing or who the family loves more. There is a world of possibilities but they are simply lumps of coal. Even the Griswold kids are not doing the sibling rivalry that well. They're the least convincing kids of the franchise. The fact that the kids are always different could be a source of self-referencing jokes. It seems like Chevy is doing all the heavy lifting to get the laughs. Everybody is playing the straight man until Randy Quaid arrives. Cousin Eddie livens up the movie a little. At least, he adds something to the movie. Also I don't really know who Nicolette Scorsese is, but she's no Christie Brinkley. The movie has a few jokes. I love the cat getting toasted.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation,"Certainly there are many things here that movie fans can identify with in dealing with crazy families over the holidays, and there definitely are dozens of laughs to be found as well as a few poignant moments. But does the character of Clark Griswold, played with overconfident bravado by Chevy Chase really make for a likeable hero? Even in the first scene with the Griswolds family out to get their Christmas tree, Clark comes off is a pompous jerk with no common sense who makes a fool out of himself and certainly wouldn't be an influence I want my children to have, let alone the sensible wife play by the gorgeous Beverly D'Angelo.Then, there are the relatives. Doris Roberts, John Randolph, Diane Ladd and E.G. Marshall are all given unique eccentricities as the parents, with Randy Quaid returning as an obnoxious cousin who plans his dilapidated trailer outside Clark's middle-class neighborhood. Obnoxious and pretentious neighbors get the worst of it with their stereo destroyed by a flying icicle, and the stench of Quaid's emptying of the trailer toilets into the local drainage ditch. then, there's Clark's awaiting his Christmas bonus from a Scrooge like boss who barely acknowledges his existence.The scene-stealing Mae Questel comes in late in the film, along with William Hickey, as elderly members of the family who are probably celebrating their last Christmas. The cute Questel steals every moment whether saying grace or breaking into sudden song. A particularly gruesome funny moments involving a family cat may disturb some, but has stood the test of time in being one of the all-time great visual gags. Had Chase toned down his character's obnoxiousness, scenes of him watching old Christmas family films might have been more touching, but his persona is one that only holds up in small doses. Even though it isn't quite as funny on repeat viewings, it is certainly better than a lot of the garbage made today celebrating the holidays that lack any sort of heart.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

His neighbours are annoyed and if that bonus does not come through Clark is up a creek without a paddle.Its huge zany fun especially as some of the cantankerous elderly members of the family provide a lot of humour, plenty of slapstick and the syrupy schmaltz is kept to a minimum.

National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation,"... crazy? At least at the brink of madness at times. Chevy Chase as Mr. Griswold .. not few will remember those names. I reckon some might have wanted to be in the extended and already big Griswold family alltogether. Now I might have rewatched this out of season, but I do think it works no matter what time of the year it is.And that is what makes this a great comedy. Also the actors and the script involved! Some jokes may be a bit .. well don't be too woke about certain things or too PC. Also yes some are just plain silly and there is a lot of don't try this at home stuff. It's a movie, try to accept it (like when Chevy is in the attic and sets his chair in the one spot where it makes no sense at all, other than to get a laugh out of the audience).So great cast and good natured humor.

National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation,"The Griswold family's plans for a big family Christmas predictably turn into a big disaster.How do you beat this?

I mean, she has her moments, but how did she get to be in this film? Being the daughter of Geoffrey Lewis? It certainly was not her work being Wayne's girlfriend on ""The Wonder Years"". Oh well. At least she went on to do better things.Today, the film is considered a modern Christmas classic, and I would have to agree. It also is a strong third entry in the franchise, second only to the original.

Portraying the Griswolds inviting several relatives to their house for Christmas, the movie portrays one mishap after another (well duh; that's what all of Chevy Chase's movies are). Particularly hilarious are the sled scene, the light scene, the squirrel scene, and Clark's rant after he finds out about his Christmas bonus.It's weird to think that among the relatives invited were the ""Prizzi's Honor"" godfather (William Hickey), the voice of Betty Boop (Mae Questel), the ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" mom (Doris Roberts), and of course Cousin Eddie (Randy Quaid).

National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation,"If you're stuck for gift ideas for that special someone this Christmas, why not give them the gift of laughter with the Chevy Chase comedy classic 'National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation? Heartwarming and hilarious, this festive favourite will guarantee a very merry time.Chase plays Clark Griswold, a well intentioned family man whose plans for the perfect Christmas go disastrously wrong: the thousands of lights that adorn his home refuse to work; his in-laws argue with his parents; the Christmas tree goes up in flames; he is trapped in the attic while hiding his gifts; a sledging incident almost costs him his life; the turkey is overdone; his embarrassing hick relatives turn up expectedly for the holidays; a wild squirrel invades the home; and worst of all, his bonus cheque seems to have gone missing in the post.Naturally, by the time Christmas Day arrives, Clark is a complete nervous wreck, and when he discovers that his Christmas bonus is a 'year's membership to a jelly club', rather than the expected cash bonus, his temper finally snaps (of course, this being a good natured Christmas tale, everything turns out right in the end, thanks to the intervention of dumb, but well-meaning Cousin Eddie).Written by 80s comedy genius John Hughes, Christmas Vacation's script is bristling with very funny lines of dialogue, but it is the visual gags that get the biggest laughs: Clark somehow driving the family saloon between the wheels of a huge truck; the bushy tailed rodent clinging to Clark's back; the sight of Clark careering across a freeway on a well oiled sled. Chase gives one of his most memorable performances, making Clark a thoroughly likable character that one can't help but admire, despite his failures, and he is given able support by a superb cast that includes Beverly D'Angelo as his long suffering wife Ellen, Randy Quaid as Cousin Eddie, and Juliette Lewis as his daughter Audrey.And the best thing about the film?

National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation,"Clark and his wonderful family want to celebrate Christmas at home and he wants to make it as perfect as possible but there is one disaster coming after the other! This is one of the comedy Christmas classics. With a great cast and many jokes.Actually, the humor is not always my thing. I am not a big fan of slapstick comedy. Animals being hurt just makes me cringe and I need a bit more to laugh but people falling or a table break down. But it still has some good moments.One thin that bothered me the most was the lack of participation by most family members. It is such a great cast but we don't see much of them besides Chevy Chase and Randy Quaid (and both were great). I was excited to see Doris Roberts, but she basically got nothing to say or do, I felt it was such a waste.As usual when watching older movies it was fun to see actors I know in their earlier roles. One would be Johnny Galecki whom I wouldn't recognize if I wouldn't see his name.I am probably more generous to this movie than I should be. If it wasn't a Christmas movie it would probably get a 6 from me, but it is just a part of the Holiday season that is worth watching.

Love Actually,"This film is an odd one in my household. Although my wife is a rather famous romance writer, for once I actually liked a romantic film more than her. I think the reason for our divergent views is that in most romance novels, all the nice people get the love of their lives by the end of the film. However, in LOVE ACTUALLY, some do but others do not. So, if you need to have a romance where everything works out perfectly, this is NOT the film for you. However, if you are like me and don't mind a bit of ambiguity about the characters, then you are sure to love this film.This story is a complicated film where there are many different stories occurring at the same time just before Christmas. What ties this all together is that the various stories all relate to each other somehow. In other words, this film is about people and their friends also have separate stories that diverge. I rarely have seen this type of film work so well.I could spend a lot of time talking about all the plots but I won't bother. Part of this is because there isn't enough space here to adequately do it and part of it is because there are tons and tons of very thorough reviews already on IMDb for this film, so I don't want to plow familiar ground. Read these longer reviews if you are interested in a play-by-play analysis.Instead, understand that some of the romances work out perfectly, others are uncertain and others are heart-breakers--just like in real life. In fact, that's the beauty of this film. While you really can't believe all the plots (some are very, very far-fetched and silly), all the people talk like real people. And the romances are just so adorable and sweet you can't watch this film and keep a dry eye. Plus, in the cases where the romance fails, I liked them as well because they all had wonderful object lessons for us all.Amazingly acted, directed and written--this is one case where a popular film actually deserves all the hoopla. In the UK it's sold like a bazillion DVDs and I can see why.By the way, there were only two things about the film I did not particularly like. First, the Prime Minister's love interest (Natalie) was a lovely woman but repeatedly throughout the film they made fat jokes about her. This made no sense, as she was gorgeous and the comments tended to reinforce the stereotype that a beautiful woman must be stick-thin--like Keira Knightley. Even if she was overweight, which she wasn't, this is gross to say and the film made it seem cute or funny to do so (not just with her but with a Portuguese lady as well). She was curvy and even if these gross comments were true, women are supposed to have curves and not be anorexic!! Second, the scene where the little boy runs through security really, really annoyed me. In reality, the kid would have either been shot or arrested and the airport would have been shut down--yet the movie shows no consequences for this insanely stupid and selfish behavior. Neither problem ruined the film but they did detract from my enjoyment of an otherwise brilliant movie.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Love Actually,"Some parts of the movie are very sentimental, but Love Actually is a well-directed and well-acted film. The script is intelligent and funny, and while the story is a little confusing, as there are so many characters, I highly recommend this. The direction by Richard Curtis is very good and well paced. I think the film's main strengths are the acting and the well-developed characters. The standout is Bill Nighy, in an unlikely but actually hilarious role. Though Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman are very good as well, in one of the more interesting stories. There is also Laura Linney and Liam Neeson, two talented actors, if you see the two of them in Kinsey you'll know what I mean. Keira Knightly, Hugh Grant and Kris Marshall also delight. In conclusion, look out for this film. I was annoyed a bit by Rowan Atkinson, but I really like this. 9/10 Bethany Cox",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Love Actually,"It's a multi-storyline movie about love. It opens on an airport arrival. It's a promising start. At least, it's a rare place to start, and it's a great place for love and reunion. Then it goes on to talk about 9-11. The calls from the people are almost always one of love rather than hate. It's a heighten call to action for a simple rom-com. They want to show that love is most powerful emotion.I like some of the stories. Mostly I found them formulaic and nothing original. However I am profoundly distracted by Hugh Grant as the bachelor Prime Minister. He is still playing the same character as his other movies which makes the Prime Minister too silly. For a movie with such a vast cast, there must be somebody more fitting to be the PM.The saddest thing about this movie is that it may have inspired more of these multi-storyline love stories. Only they are getting more and more insipid. If a love story is good enough, it should be able to fill a whole movie.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Love Actually,"It's a matter of weeks until Christmas in London and despite the claims by Billy Mack's song that `Christmas is all around' really it is love that seems to be everywhere. Some of it is flirting, some of it is infatuation, some of it is lust, some of it is loss, some of it is dedication, some of it is failing, some of it is adulterous, some of it is longing and some of it is unrequited. In a thinly connected collection of lives, we see men and women involved in all the various types of love as the festive season approaches.Despite the hype and critical fawning over this film, I didn't bother going to the cinema to see this film as love, actually, pretty much sucked at that moment in my life! Things hadn't really changed when I got round to seeing it on DVD but I didn't feel that I could allow myself to miss the `best British film ever' for any more time. The film starts with one of the most morally abhorrent openings I have seen in quite some time - I put it right up there with Doberman for having the opening that made me think about stopping the film a matter of seconds into the movie. Curtis is a successful writer, but using the memory of the murdered families of 9/11 and cashing in on their dying sentiments is tasteless in the extreme and I was shocked that he had done it. Despite this, I stuck with the film (hell - I'd paid for it!) and was glad to find that he didn't misfire this badly again. However the film is not as good as the hype would suggest it to be although it is amusing enough to watch once and to keep you involved.The film does well to just about keep control of so many different strands and special mention should probably go to the editors for keeping it together. However, this does not meant that the plot is any good - just that it hangs together well despite the difficulties it presented. It is not that good; the majority of the strands are underdeveloped and very superficial. The `love' and relationships here do not engage and never really seem real - only the marriage damaged by flirting struck me as being a good shot at reality for many people. The rest of the relationship are the ones you get in film - where it doesn't matter if they are based on physical attraction (like Jamie's cleaner), or on flirting or the thinnest of reasons because all that matters is that they are sweet and romantic for the duration of the film. In this regard it manages to be just about amusing enough without ever really being funny and enjoyable without ever really being charming. I doubt that, for me, it would hold up to repeat viewings though - the substance is just too lacking for that.What surprised me about the film most was just how very focused the characters were in terms of relationships. With so many different characters I was surprised that each and every relationship was a) straight and b) white. OK - Juliet's husband was black, but he was not the romantic focus of her strand. This is not a claim of racism or anything so stupid, I was just surprised that Curtis didn't at least try to write in an `alternative' relationship to what is admittedly the `norm'. This didn't spoil the film for me but I would have liked to see such an ensemble piece include a spread of relationships (without just making it a token thing).The cast is stellar and it is just as well as their `familiarity' helps to cover the fact that the script doesn't really help us to get to know any of the characters. Nighy has a good time in his role and his `love' would actually have been the sweetest and most touching one of the film had it not been handled as a joke. Firth is charming but his character is paper-thin - we see no emotion from him considering the situation at the start and his `love' is out of nothing. Grant is OK in the most comic of the relationships but his dance is the worst scene in the film and the `anti-American' bit just seems to come out of nowhere and go nowhere. Neeson is good, but again I never felt his loss as a real thing. Rickman and Thompson's thread is the strongest of the film and the only problem I had with them was that the film had a scene with Rickman talking about `Karl' and I couldn't stop laughing! The remainder are mixed - Linney's relationship is interesting but not expanded on, while Freeman's stuff could easily have been lost. Special mention from me for Sosanya - she has little to do here but she is a very good actress who still does stage work (and also happens to be gorgeous!). The star cameos are OK - they don't add a great deal but they don't detract either - all seem to be beautiful women so I can't complain for the inclusion of Richards, Cuthbert and Schiffer. However add Wes Butters, Jo Wiley, Atkinson (pointless), Ant & Dec (funny - `Ant or Dec'!), Thornton, Parkinson and so many others and you begin to wonder why the film had to cram in so many. To be honest with you I truly believe that this film could have been so much more touching, romantic and involving if it had lost half of these stories and just developed the remaining ones to be realer and more involving.Overall this isn't a very good film but it is so damn `busy' that it manages to make you miss the fact that it could have been so much better than it was. The sheer amount of stuff going on means that very few of the relationship get beyond the superficial level of unrealistic romance, plus the fact that too few of the relationship bare any relation to reality (especially as more and more gorgeous cameos are wheeled out). It may not be funny or charming but it does just enough so that it leaves you with a sweet feeling. I quite liked it but found it hard to overlook these weaknesses - why it was so highly regarded by critics is quite beyond me but if you're after a typically romantic comedy that gives you a warm feeling with no sense of reality then this will probably do you.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The interconnection of the stories has a perfect timing. The cast is a constellation, highlighting the shining beauty of Keira Knightley and the nice role of Hugh Grant. There are many wonderful moments, such as the collective interview of the Prime Minister and the American president; or the moment when Karen finds that her Christmas gift is a CD of Joni Mitchell; or when Mark declares his secret love for Juliet; or the relationship of Daniel and Sam; or when Daniel meets Carol; or when the manager of Billy makes a comment about Elton John; or the narration in off in the beginning of the movie.

Many of the characters are brought together at Heathrow Airport, with real arrivals and the song ""God Only Knows"" by The Beach Boys playing.

Love Actually,"This romantic comedy follows several interconnected couples in the five weeks running up to Christmas; each is very different and not all are romantic love. We have the newly elected prime minister finding love with a member of his staff; his sister whose marriage could be in danger when another woman catches the eye of her husband; a widower whose young son has fallen in love with a girl in his class; a writer who falls for his Portuguese maid despite the fact that they can't understand each other; a single man who believes that if he goes to America women will throw themselves at him; a couple of porn actors; a man who loves his best friend's new wife and a few others besides.Over the course of the film we move between the characters, dipping in and out of their lives as their relationships develop or don't. Don't expect realism; this is after all a comedy not a study of real relationships or situations. It is however a lot of fun and will probably leave most viewers grinning from ear to ear thanks to the feel-good stories; even if they seem to include every cliché possible! The cast includes a wide array of British acting talent including rom-com regulars Hugh Grant and Colin Firth. They all put in fine performances although some inevitably stand out; Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson were great as a couple whose marriage might be about to go through a rough patch and Bill Nighy was hilarious as the aging rocker who has recorded a Christmas single; he knows it is awful and is happy to tell everybody. There is some swearing and nudity but if that doesn't offend you this is an enjoyable film just the thing to watch on Christmas if you've had enough of 'Die Hard'!",0,1,0,0,0,1,-999
Love Actually,"At Christmas, even an out-and-out hardcore horror freak like me occasionally puts the blood 'n' guts goes on hold for something a little lighter and more heart warming. And they don't come much more fluffy and saccharine sweet than Love Actually (which I'm squeezing in between a Dario Argento giallo and a trashy Pete Walker slasher).Director Richard Curtis delivers a series of cleverly written tales about the trials and tribulations of love, covering the many facets of the subject: unrequited love, platonic love, adulterous love, young love, spontaneous love, dangerous love. Always chuckle-some, occasionally laugh-out-loud funny, but never boring, Curtis's sparkling script brings us a collection of likable characters who are brilliantly brought to life by an amazing ensemble cast, which includes Hugh Grant, Emma Thompson, Colin Firth, Keira Knightley, Bill Nighy, Alan Rickman, Martine McCutcheon, Rowan Atkinson, Liam Neeson, and Billy Bob Thornton, plus brief cameos from, amongst others, Michael Parkinson, Ant and Dec, Elisha Cuthbert, Claudia Schiffer, Shannon Elizabeth and Denise Richards.Nighy, in particular, shines as a has-been rocker vying for the Xmas No.1 spot, giving a bittersweet take on the whole romance schtick, as does Laura Linney who plays Sarah, a woman whose love for her brother costs her the chance of scoring with her dream man. On the more traditionally 'sappy' side of things, Grant's Prime Minister falling for working class cutie McCutcheon borders on fantasy, but is perfect viewing fodder for couples curled up in each other's arms on the couch.Now, if you'll excuse me, I think I'll get back to the wanton slaughter of buxom women before I find myself hooked on rom-coms!",1,1,1,1,0,1,0
It's a Wonderful Life,"This is a very good movie. Period. A ""classic"", I don't think so. This is a movie whose actual quality has been exceeded by its hype--though NOT because the producers or actors hyped it (like the typical overblown and over-hyped Hollywood film). In fact, when it was released it was not particularly successful (especially compared to other Frank Capra flicks).No, instead it reached legendary status for TWO reasons alone. It was a public domain video (hence NO ROYALTIES REQUIRED FOR SHOWING IT) AND its setting for the movie's conclusion was the holiday season. These two factors worked together to BLITZ the American public from the 1980s to the late 90s (until its copyright status was restored). I remember these dark days, when It's A Wonderful Life was literally shown on half a dozen channels at the same time!! Not even GREAT movies should be shown that much! As a result, many began proclaiming it a classic while some others got awfully tired of seeing it--which is a shame because it's a very good film.",0,-999,-999,-999,-999,-999,-999
It's a Wonderful Life,"It's a Wonderful Life is something truly special, and along with Scrooge, the original Miracle on 34th Street and Home Alones 1 and 2, it is something I watch every Christmas. Why? Because I love this movie, seriously I do. Looking through my 1000 or so reviews here, I couldn't believe I hadn't reviewed this movie; I have seen movies that I have loved and cherished since childhood and I have seen movies that belong at the bottom of the garbage. It's a Wonderful Life belongs to the former, although I am 17, I appreciate a good movie when I see one. This is more than a good movie, it's a timeless masterpiece, that holds up on repeated viewings and never loses its magic.It's a Wonderful Life could have easily been overly-sentimental and clichéd, but the quality of the direction and the screenplay that others have summed up perfectly assured it was a beautiful, heart-warming and somewhat poignant film. While there are some funny parts, not bursting-your-gut funny but funny in a subtle sort of way, other parts are close to heart-rending. The direction from Frank Capra is excellent, sensitive and nuanced, and Capra shows even more talent as a screenwriter having penned one of the most honest and touching scripts ever in a film. Casablanca, All About Eve and The Shawshank Redemption all had wonderful scripts, but the script here has a lot to say about community spirit and shows that this film is much more than feel-good sentimentality. There is the element of feel good here, no doubt about it, but it doesn't overpower what the film intends.Visually, It's a Wonderful Life is a wonder. I don't think it is dated at all, the cinematography is crisp, the black and white looks beautiful and the pristine Christmas scenery really does take me back. Some of my favourite ever memories was of Christmas, whether it was watching nostalgic Christmas videos, eating Christmas dinner or singing carols under the Christmas tree. Another thing I have to mention is that the movie is richly and beautifully scored, Dmitri Tiomkin's music here is absolutely gorgeous, lyrical, whimsical, nostalgic and most importantly it never felt intrusive in the more integral parts of the film. And I have to mention the story, never in my life(and I genuinely mean this) have I seen a movie where it communicates such a strong message and so well too. The story of a suicidal man who is shown the value of his life by his guardian angel is an effective, timeless one, imitated perhaps but never equalled.Finally the acting is wonderful. James Stewart, and I seriously don't give a damn whether he was a racist or not and neither should you, is absolutely superb as George Bailey, a truly complex character who goes through such a lot to get to where he is at the end of the movie. George Bailey is like Mr Deeds, John Doe and Mr Smith rolled into one, and in my opinion only James Stewart could have given justice to a character that has self-doubt gnawed at his essential decency. Also the character change, like that of Alistair Sim's Scrooge at the end of Scrooge, was heart-breakingly believable. Donna Reed is radiant and charming as his wife, who is like a caring lover, devoted wife and dedicated mother, while Thomas Mitchell gives one of his more memorable performances as Uncle Billy. Henry Travers is a revelation as Clarence the guardian angel, but there is another performance I think is worth of mention. For a good morality tale, you need a good villain. Well in the name of Potter, you have one. Who better to portray him than the great Lionel Barrymore acting at the peak of his powers? Overall, a timeless classic with a true and heart-rendingly poignant ending. 10/10, one of the easiest perfect scores I have made recently. Bethany Cox",1,1,1,1,1,1,1
It's a Wonderful Life,"I've always thought that the reason It's A Wonderful Life has had such enduring popularity is that more than in any other film it shows what can be the value of a single individual and the contribution to the greater good they can make.George Bailey as portrayed by James Stewart is the kind of every man hero we can all identify with. He's got the every day problems to be sure, raising and providing for a family, but he's got bigger problems than that. Fate has made him the rallying point of opposition in his small town of Bedford Falls to the ""richest and meanest man in town"", embodied in Lionel Barrymore.It's a real David vs. Goliath battle. Barrymore seems to have unlimited resources at his disposal. Samuel S. Hinds as Peter Bailey put it so well to him in asking what are you doing all this for? Barrymore does have more money than he could ever possibly use. A little charity wouldn't hurt him.Remember the basic plot outline. A whole lot of people in Bedford Falls one post World War II Christmas Eve see that their friend George is toting a heavy load of mysterious origins. Their prayers reach the heavens where an angel is dispatched to aid.But before Henry Travers the angel arrives, he's given the story of George Bailey's life. And we see the kind of struggles he's had, the sacrifices he's made for the good of a whole lot of others. We've also seen a greedy and grasping Potter, grabbing everything that George Bailey cannot save. Something happens that day before Christmas through no fault of his own, Bailey is in big trouble. It's driven him to the brink of despair. That's why the angel is sent down. He shows him the alternate universe that would have been had he never existed. It's something each and every one of us should try to do, step outside ourselves see just what our contributions can be.But I think what Frank Capra is trying to say in this greatest of his films is that having done that and we realize we haven't contributed to the greater good of humankind, we resolve to do so. It's a simple, but profound lesson.What if Potter got the same opportunity? In a sense Charles Dickens did just that in A Christmas Carol. Would Lionel Barrymore change? It's an interesting point of speculation.In addition to those cast members already mentioned a whole group of players who worked with Capra before grace this film. Add to that some others and you have a perfectly cast feature picture.Donna Reed has an interesting part as well. Your choice of mate is real important in life. Had she not been as loving and supportive to George Bailey, he might very well have taken a different route in life. Mary Hatch Bailey became a signature part for her, more identified than her role in From Here to Eternity which got her an Oscar. It certainly was the basis for her TV series.When Todd Karns who plays Harry Bailey toasts his brother he's saying that the riches of the world are not necessarily things that can be quantified. Your life is not measured in material things, but in how you use the material things given you. And that universal lesson will be taught into eternity as long as It's A Wonderful Life is shown every year. Wouldst we all learn it.",1,1,1,1,0,1,0
It's a Wonderful Life,"It's a Wonderful Life (1946)**** (out of 4) This timeless classic has James Stewart playing George Bailey, a frustrated businessman who gets the chance to see what the world would have been like had he never been born. I've lost count of how many times I've watched this film over the years but it keeps getting better with each new viewing and I can't help but notice new things each time I watch it. There's really nothing I could add that hasn't already been said about this movie but it's certainly one of my all time favorites and I'd argue that it's one of the greatest ever made. This movie has been called timeless by many people but I really can't think of too many movies where this is more true. I can't possibly see how this movie would ever grow old fashioned or out of touch because there's always going to be people who feel like the main character here. The most amazing thing to me is that the film perfectly captures how someone might begin to feel that they're worthless and I can't help but think that anyone who watches this movie will have a better look on life or themselves after watching it. I really can't think of too many movies that contain as much power as this one but I'd say that's why new fans are gained each and every passing year. The greatness of the film is certainly its heart but Stewart also deserves a lot of credit for his marvelous performance, which is certainly one of the best of his career. There are countless scenes in this movie where Stewart just nails it and I'm sure everyone knows the praying in the bar scene but there are many other great ones as well. On this viewing the scene on the bridge when Stewart begs for his life back hit me unlike any other time. There's also the scene in the bank where George has to bargain with the people not to take all of their money. Lionel Barrymore was always great playing bad guys and I can't help but think he's one of the greatest villains in movie history. The evilness that Barrymore is able to get through this character makes it among the actors best work. Donna Reed, Thomas Mitchell and Harry Travers also add great support. Every inch of this movie works flawlessly and that includes the sequences where George gets to see things as if he were never born. I think these moments contain Capra's greatest work as a director as the darkness and atmosphere he creates is so think and depression that it perfectly puts you in the mind frame of George. Then you've got that priceless ending, which ranks right up there with City Lights and Psycho as being the greatest for any movie.",1,1,1,1,0,1,0
It's a Wonderful Life,"Frank Capra's 1946 drama/fantasy IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE is one of the best-remembered films of all time, and it's no surprise; this moralistic tale of human suffering, poverty, greed, courage and determination is one that resounds through the ages, particularly so in our modern age of fat-cat bankers and a growing gap between rich and poor.James Stewart gives a dependably decent turn as George Bailey, a family man who finds himself at the mercy of Lionel Barrymore's criminal banker, Mr. Potter. What follows is lengthy and often profound, an occasionally twee but ultimately moving exploration of the human character and the effect one man can have on his world.What I particularly liked about IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE is the way that every part of the narrative hangs together without any unnecessary extras. Even the little bits like the accident on the ice at the outset later come back to haunt our characters. It's very well written, and expertly directed by Frank Capra; an unashamedly old-fashioned, heart-warming and sentimental piece of movie-making on a grand scale. I'd even go so far as to call it the ultimate Christmas film.",1,0,1,1,0,0,0

His dream is to travel the world, and create great monuments. He is constantly dragged back to the unimpressive little Bedford Falls and the family Savings and Loans. He is a good guy who constantly does the right thing.This is classic Frank Capra. The nice guy struggles but always win in the end.

It's a Wonderful Life,"Once again, my two cents' worth of a film that is the darling of so many people, myself included. It has its uplifting conclusion, and the theme that every life has its purpose in the great scheme of things. George Bailey is in trouble. He has decided to end it all. The thought of jail and disgrace is more than he can handle. George's life has been a continual parade of missed opportunities. There is a layer of pain just above the surface of nearly every scene. George is a victim and this series of disappointments takes its toll. He eventually becomes hardened and frustrated, but because he is honorable, he goes about the business of living. He has gifts he doesn't realize. He has family. He has status, and while not often appreciated, he is. Unfortunately, we don't always share our love and admiration with those who deserve it. His sense of adventure from birth has been clutched from him over and over. His bad ear makes the army an impossibility, his father's death forces him to run a business he wants to run away from, and even his honeymoon money is used to prevent a run on the bank. George never knows his importance until Henry Travers' well meaning angel comes along.I love this movie, but I also take it seriously. It can be painful to watch sometimes. The best scenes are the ones where George never existed. His despair is evident and the tension builds higher and higher. When he comes back, such a weight that is lifted. Jimmy Stewart is at the top of his acting form; I loved him as a living human being and as an actor; he portrays the kindness I believe the world should have.And then there is Donna Reed, Lionel Barrymore, Ward Bond, and all the others. They are superb. It's a question all of us have wrestled with: ""What if we had never existed?"" There is no peer in Capra's canon. I truly believe that this is a necessary part of our heritage. We need to see things as they should be. I love Christmas because it at least portends to be the time we all look at our gifts. This movie is a gift to the world and one we can learn from over and over, even if the events never took place.",1,1,1,1,0,1,0
It's a Wonderful Life,"`George Bailey is a pillar of his community whose life has been selflessly dedicated to the welfare of others. Through the evil machinations of the town's business mogul, George is driven to the point of suicide. In answer to the prayers of the townsfolk, a missing angel comes to the rescue. He shows George what a sad and sorry place the town would have been without him. Can this life George out of his despair?'Who hasn't seen this film? Anyone? It is an unashamed tribute to homely values and is hugely warming. The story itself is not exactly rocket science, but it is does contain plenty of nice touches as we follow George through his life of missed opportunities and sacrifice through to his marriage and eventual down fall. The world that this happens seems so distant nowadays, with our friendless society - so few people do anything for their fellow man in big cities etc. So this is very touching to see a man who serves others in such a major way. It is a story of how every little helps and how you cannot overdo friendly gestures.Stewart is excellent with his partner Capra. Barrymore is also excellent in a thankless role - he represents all that is wrong in society and of course he rises to a powerful position. Henry Travers is good as Clarence, the wingless angel and of course who can forget the excellent Donna Reed as Mary.It's pure hokum of course, the regular Christmas movie that lifts everyone's spirits. But isn't this what we all wish the world was like really? Why can't it be - if only for two hours. This is what Stewart and Capra do best - enjoy and forget the real world.",1,1,1,1,0,1,0

He inherited the loan business of his father and he gave up traveling the world and joining the university as scheduled. Later he resisted the proposals of the evil banker Mr. Potter (Lionel Barrymore) and has never sold his business to protect the poor community of Bedford Falls and offer a means to afford to buy their own house. He married his beloved Mary Hatch Bailey (Donna Reed) and had four children with her and a tough life with his family. When his uncle Billy (Thomas Mitchell) loses US$ 8,000.00, found and stolen by Mr. Potter, George decides to commit suicide, since he believes he worth more dead than alive. When Clarence sees that he is not able to persuade George to give up his intention, he decides to show the life in town if George had never existed. George concludes that life is wonderful.""It's a Wonderful Life"" is certainly one of the most beautiful movies of the cinema history ever. This masterpiece has a touching and moralist story, showing that the famous sentence that a man can make the difference is true. Everything works perfectly in this movie. The original screenplay develops the situation and the characters accurately, using flashbacks and magnificent lines. The direction of Frank Capra is outstanding as usual. The cinematography in black & white and using shadows and lights is fantastic. James Stewart leads an amazing cast, showing a perfect chemistry with the gorgeous Donna Reed, in the role of a compassionate and enlightened good man. Lionel Barrymore is also amazing in the role of the despicable banker. I do not recall how many times I have already seen this film, but last time was 16 Dec 2000.

It's a Wonderful Life,"In looking at this glorious Christmas classic, it's easy to get so involved in the psychology behind it. we obviously become so caught up in our own lives that we often forget about how others around us have influenced who we become and vice versa. This film, which has been redone in many different forms, including taking popular characters from TV shows, both daytime and nighttime and putting them in the same situation as Jimmy Stewart, truly stands the test of time. Not only is it watching one man's slow destruction from things that seem to be beyond his control, it's seeing how one person can deal with the ruthless machinations of the pure evil around him and open the eyes of everybody else to see what's really going on.In a return to the Christmas theme that he earlier used in 1941 classic ""Meet John Doe"", director Frank Capra saves the seasonal Twist of the story for the film's last half-hour. An unseen angel is sent to a small town to aid a possible suicide victim when the actions of the greedy and evil Lionel Barrymore threatens to send him to prison for embezzlement. Stewart's life is seen in flashbacks for much of the film, but when the film joins the present day, it is almost like it has gone some 70 years into the future to today with Barrymore representing the truly evil Scrooge like banker who wants to control everybody's life.It is quite a shocker to see Barrymore playing such a nasty, evil man after playing the kindly Dr. Gillespie in the series of MGM medical dramas. he is basically expanding the role of Scrooge which he did on radio for many years and adds an essence of true malevolence to his characterization. Even Scrooge wasn't as crass as his character here. It seems to be a continuation of the role that Edward Arnold played so beautifully in Capra's earlier films ""Mr Smith Goes to Washington"" and ""Meet John Doe"".The lovely Donna Reed crosses over from MGM ingenue to classy leading lady, adding much depth to her role of Stewart's girlfriend, later wife, with Beulah Bondi saintly as usual his lovable mother. (Bondi played Stewart's mother in so many films and on TV that it is obvious that somehow in real life, he did call her ma.) Then there's Gloria Grahame as the town flirt, Thomas Mitchell as Stewart's rascal uncle, and of course Henry Travers as Clarence, the angel who desperately wants his wings. The smaller roles are filled out by many familiar actors, some of whom were in pretty much every Capra film, as well as Danny Mummert and Larry Simms, both from the ""Blondie"" series and Karolyn Grimes, an underrated child star who stole many movie programmers in the mid-1940s.There are so many other things to credit for this film's excellence beyond the cast and direction, namely the brilliant script, fast pacing and brilliant production design. This film holds up regardless of whether you see it in its original black-and-white form or it's decently restored colorized version. I'm not in favor of colorizing classic movies, but somehow this one actually came out all right. while I watch this one every other year rather than every year, I can say that I am continuously touched and discover new seems in its that I had not seen before. It is no wonder that this is on nearlt everybody's list of the top Christmas movies of all time.",1,1,1,1,0,1,0

"I absolutely love the first two Home Alone movies, the third one is adequate but the fourth movie is just dreadful and makes me vomit because of what it did to two underrated gems and a little -below-average follow up. Macaulay Culkin is wonderful as Kevin. In this and Home Alone 2, which is my personal favourite, he is cute and self-assured. Alex D Linz gives a spirited performance in Home Alone 3, but Michael Weinburg just doesn't do anything with the script(which was terrible), other than whine in the fourth film. Anyway back to Home Alone. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern steal the film, with their goofiness and charm that was evidently missed in the last two instalments. Matching them, is the late great John Candy, and here he is wonderful. Candy has starred in movies like Uncle Buck and Planes, Trains and Automobiles, both of which are hilarious. Home Alone just broadens the comedic talent, that Candy certainly had. The film looks beautiful, with very good direction, and best of all great visual jokes and traps, as well as a fun and sometimes touching script. My problem is why is the rating for both Home Alone and Home 2 so low, when almost everyone I know consider them as holiday classics? All in all, a funny, touching and underrated film, that could have been a little shorter(only by one or two minutes). 9/10 Bethany Cox",1,1,0,1,0,1,0,
"Home Alone (1990)*** (out of 4)Blockbuster dealing with eight-year-old Kevin McCallister (Macaulay Culkin) who after a fight with his family wishes that he never has to see them again. The next day Kevin wakes up with his family no where to be found. He believes that his hopes have been answered but soon he's having to deal with a couple burglars (Joe Pesci, Daniel Stern) who have their eyes on his house.If you were around in 1990 then you will remember the tremendous success that HOME ALONE had with critics, fans and at the box office. To say the film was a landmark would be an understatement because the film was a huge hit and has gained plenty of fans over the years. After twenty-six years I think it's safe to say that the film is a new classic. While the film isn't perfect it's certainly a lot of fun and perfectly captures the manic spirit of Christmas time.What makes the film work so well is that it's a perfect child fantasy. I'm sure many kids have wished that they were the boss, the keeper of the house and that the adults would just go away. This film works perfectly fulfilling that fantasy but of course there's the more touching moments thrown in for good measure. What makes the film a classic are the battles between the kid and the burglars. Culkin, Pesci and Stern would all become household names after this film and it's easy to see why.Culkin is absolutely adorable as the brat kid who finds himself home alone and doing battle against his fears as well as the two bad guys. The violence in the film is in the same field as The Three Stooges and it works perfectly well. Not only does the violence work but it's perfectly sold by Pesci and Stern who are terrific and easily steal the film as Harry and Marv. The two of them have perfect chemistry together and they really make for a great comic team.The supporting cast is very good with the likes of John Heard, Roberts Blossom, Catherine O'Hara and John Candy all doing fine work. Another major plus is the score from John Williams as well as an all-around great charm. The film contains some great laughs throughout and I think after all these years it's fair to call it a classic.",1,1,0,0,0,1,0,
"I saw and loved HOME ALONE as a kid, particularly enjoying all the 'home invasion' traps that Kevin McCallister set up for the bad guys. Watching it nowadays, I'm surprised to see that this sequence only takes up the last quarter of the movie; before then there's a surprisingly complex storyline with some good sub-plots to keep it moving nicely along.That this also turns out to be a classic film which has lost none of its warmth and magic is the biggest surprise. Yes, Macaulay Culkin is more than a little annoying when you watch him as an adult - in fact, I remember him being annoying when I watched him as a kid - but you can forgive him because he's endearing nonetheless. Of the supporting cast, the ones who particularly shine are Joe Pesci (channelling some of that GOODFELLAS energy), Daniel Stern, and Roberts Blossom (DERANGED).The film was written by John Hughes, so the expected sentimentality is here, but somehow it never becomes too cloying - you can live with it, because there's plenty of good stuff elsewhere. That home invasion stuff is still superbly directed, surprisingly violent, and very funny, and there's so much ingenuity packed into the running time that this is a film impossible to dislike. In fact, I still love it.",1,1,0,1,0,0,0,
"Kevin McCallister (Macaulay Culkin) is the youngest of a large family. They are preparing to go to Paris for Christmas. The power goes out overnight, and none of the clocks work. The family rushes to get on the plane and leave little Kevin behind. The Wet Bandits, Harry Lyme (Joe Pesci) and Marv Merchants (Daniel Stern), come to town to rob the McCallister home only to battle Kevin and his home made traps.Director Chris Columbus and writer John Hughes team up to create one of the most iconic comedies of its era. It's in no small part due to the iconic scene of Macaulay Culkin slapping his face and Scream. Take it away, it's a rather crass juvenile kiddie movie. I'm not complaining, just explaining. Expect a lot of slapstick stupidity with the annoying Wet Bandits.",0,0,0,1,-999,0,-999,
"This year it is already 24 years ago that Chris Columbus' ""Home Alone"" starring Macaulay Culkin was released and the film gets shown pretty much every holiday season here. It also scored 2 Academy Award nominations, probably mostly because it was by far the most commercially successful movie in the United States in 1990. Of course, that is also why so far there have been three sequels, with only the second starring the lead actor and most of the original cast in ""Home Alone 2: Lost in New York"". Columbus directed this sequel as well and later worked on ""Mrs Doubtfire"" and several ""Harry Potter"" films.One of the strengths of ""Home Alone"" is that also all the smaller characters bring quite some charm and fun. Kevin's uncle (especially during his scenes in the plane) is my favorite smaller funny character and Old Man Marley brings the emotional highlights here. That church scene was particularly wonderful. What a shame the actor is not alive anymore. Same goes for the film's writer John Hughes and John Candy, who both died way too early. Mentioning John Hughes, I was a bit surprised that the smoking Santa was not him in a small role. He exactly looked that way. You may have seen some of Hughes' other very known works such as ""The Breakfast Club"", ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"", ""101 Dalmatians"" and many more.Another mention goes out to Joe Pesci, who has had a true career year in 1990. Here he plays the chubby, slightly smarter villain (over Daniel Stern's character) compared to his completely sinister mafiosi gangster turn in ""Goodfellas"", which won him the Oscar that year. Culkin was nominated for a Golden Globe in the musical/comedy actor category, but lost to Gerard Depardieu, who won for the only movie from all the nominees which is not considered a classic or close to that description today.""Home Alone"" runs for roughly 100 minutes and will make you laugh a lot and also touch you. The latter happened for me mostly with the old man with the snow shovel and how meeting Kevin impacts his life. My favorite funny scene was the gangster film playing with the poor pizza guy coming along. I saw it so often already, but it never fails to crack me up. I am not sure if I would call this movie a classic or even an epic, but it is certainly worth a watch. Recommended.",1,1,1,1,1,1,0,
"My response to this movie is strictly prejudiced. For all it violence and lack of verisimilitude, I get a kick out it ever time I see it. If one can't get past the fact that the Wile E. Coyote element is in here (where no one ever seems to get hurt, no matter what), you aren't going to have much fun. With that caveat, the movie is a bit of a hoot. McCauley Culkin came to stardom in this (it's too bad his life became unsettled after this). Watching Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern, the ever optimistic though doomed villains, continue to fight a losing cause against an eight year old is the stuff cartoons are made of. Their mugging as they try one thing after another, only to be thwarted, is great fun. The subplot of the mother hooking up with a polka band, led by the inimitable John Candy, adds an element of joy. There is also the relationship that grows with a frightening man next door who has been tabbed a murderer by the insensitivity of the neighborhood kids. This man is estranged from his son and has lapsed into a sad existence. This raises this up from just a kid movie to one with a bit more substance. Anyway, don't take it to seriously and one may have a bit of fun at the holidays.",0,0,0,-999,-999,0,-999,

"After being accidentally left home alone by his family, Kevin McAllister (Macaulay Culkin) must defend his residence from the Wet Bandits (Daniel Stern and Joe Pesci), who are for some reason obsessed with the idea of hurting the little boy and stealing useless knick-knacks.This film is a legend and a classic. Released in 1990, it captures both the more serious 1990s with the fun 1980s. Two 1980s masters come together to film this one: John Hughes as writer (""Sixteen Candles"", ""Pretty in Pink"", ""The Breakfast Club"") and Chris Columbus as director (""Adventures in Babysitting""). This makes for the perfect blend in young adult situation comedy.This is the film that launched Macaulay Culkin's career. While he had previously appeared in ""Jacob's Ladder"" and ""Uncle Buck"", this was (and remains) his biggest and most cherished role. I would find it safe to say no film since has really captured the essence of Macaulay. While ""Saved"" and ""Party Monster"" are both (possibly) equally as good movies, they do not have the mass appeal of ""Home Alone"".What is best about the film is its sense of fun. The plot really makes little sense. How does a family not notice they have an extra plane ticket or that a sibling is missing? Why would burglars break into a house where they can be identified? How can Joe Pesci get beat up relentlessly and not curse once? Is it possible to not have a single friend, family member or neighbor in all of Chicago? The ""Scream"" joke was used too much (four times). At least one, and probably two, instances could have been removed. Do we need to see a little boy twice getting burned by aftershave? Of course not. The repeated use of the ""keep the change you filthy animal"" joke seemed to work very well, though, strangely enough.Overall, this is a great Christmas movie. Along with ""Die Hard"" this is one you really need to make sure you watch around the holidays, at least once. If you have never seen ""Home Alone"" you are one of five people on earth or something... it was a huge success. With good reason. So see it.",1,0,-1,1,-999,0,-999,
"This an absurd storyline. Hollywood loves to show movies in which kids are smarter than adults, for some reason. Also, we are expected to believe a big family can go all the way to the airport and then fly to France before finding out one of their kids was left at home??! I don't think so. I know a lot of big families and this would never-in-a-million years happen.However, it's just a movie, and it isn't real and you can't take any of it seriously. Thus, the idea is to go along with the wild premise and enjoy the antics that follow....and there are plenty of those!A share of the credit for the big success of this film should go to God, who made Maccaulay Culkin's face. Without it, I doubt this would have been anywhere near the hit is was, but Culkin's ""cuteness"" helps makes you root for him and his facial expressions provide a lot of laughs. He turned out to be a fine child actor.The two guys (Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern) that play incompetent crooks are funny and some of the humor is clever, although slapstick ""rules"" in this film.There are some really nice messages in here, such as ""families suck,"" says the kid.

"When I heard Daniel Stern speak at Lewis & Clark College in September, 2004, about his USO tour in Iraq, he said that while ""Home Alone"" had a bunch of silly gags, at least it only had them once; the sequel just repeated everything. When you think about it, that makes sense. This movie was funny the first time (I certainly loved it when I saw it in the theaters), but not much after that. I gotta ask: what happened to John Hughes? In the '80s, he made movies like ""The Breakfast Club"", ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"", and ""Planes, Trains & Automobiles""; in the '90s, he got into dropping things on people's heads (think ""Home Alone"" and ""Baby's Day Out""). Oh well, life goes on. And for the record, Daniel Stern also said that when he was in Iraq, some Iraqi children recognized him from this movie; that made him understand the reach of American culture.",0,-999,-999,-999,-999,-999,-999,

He wishes that the family would disappear. The next morning, the family leave and realise when they are in Paris that they have forgot one thing, Kevin (Golden Globe nominated Macaulay Culkin)!

The Stand,"Well, we just got one episode but this doesn't look too good; it seems to me that people - especially - in the movie business (like in other fields of media) are not chosen by their talent and skill but by other criteria. Alone the idea of jumping back and forth in the timeline is one big let-down that destroys anything that could be called story or suspense. Production, cast and everything else is nothing special but rather pretty mediocre and standard. Well, Mr. King must live with the fact that many adaptions of his work on screen do not work well.

This version is more for ""Fan-Geeks of The Stand who have everything"" as a Christmas present (I realize this only came out on Christmas because of our REAL pandemic)...Even with the nonlinear this series doesn't not, so far, compared to the original miniseries King wrote himself, and that, while a bit corny at times, is still quite good, and you can watch it again and again.Bottom line: This feels more like a Stand television series than a miniseries.

I believe this began filming before Covid, but whether it's appropriate or not for the times isn't as big a question as why this program is so poorly done and so horribly written and cast.

The Stand,"I just can't for the life of me understand why they thought it was a good idea to start the story in medias res and tell it via flashbacks. I very rarely review shows/films I didn't like (it's just not interesting to me) but this unnecessary approach to one of my favorite stories irks me so much I just have to get the frustration out of my system - so please excuse me for ranting.Why - just why? The Stand is a tale about an epic - linear - journey the same way The Lord Of The Rings is: or would you have thought it clever to introduce Legolas, Aragon and Gandalf when they stroll around in Minas Tirith shortly before their final battle against Sauron and then tell the audience via flashbacks how they got there?The most intriguing aspect of the story told in The Stand is following the characters from the relative normalcy of their lives before the virus strikes to the at first slow but then quickly accelerating unraveling of society until total meltdown happens and the protagonists eventually head into literal Armageddon.It's an epic journey; witnessing it from the beginning to the end in chronological order is the whole point. It's also how the characters' arcs are set up: they're on a journey too, in more than one way; as their world transforms, they do too. A flashback structure very much defeats the purpose of the whole premise and sucks every ounce of tension out of the narrative.I get that there are books that are very hard to adapt without changing the structure, but The Stand is decidedly not one of those. In fact, most of King's novels offer the perfect narrative structure for a direct adaptation into a film or mini series, and if you look at the best films based on his works - Stand By Me, The Shawshank Redemption, The Green Mile, Misery and The Mist - they all tell straight-forward, linear stories the way King put them on the page.So come on, it's not rocket science: just follow the book! Rant over.",-1,-999,-1,-999,-999,-999,-999
The Stand,I expected a lot more from this show though the start was just awful dont know what every director thinks they are a Tarrantino and think that they can master flash backs...just show us a story form the start and build up to the present. This has the look of a Syfy channel show and violence and foul language wont save it.This show will BOMB!,-1,-999,-1,-1,-999,-999,-999
The Stand,"This new adaptation of The Stand was something I was really looking forward to but I haven't been let down this badly since the last season of Game of Thrones.Something went seriously wrong with this production and whoever greenlight the badly misjudged decision to mess about with the running order of the story, should seriously be fired from their job. It just doesn't work and just because it's a cool trend right now, doesn't mean you should try be like bloody West World. I mean who decided this? Have you even read the book? Do you understand how storytelling works? Stop embracing a trend which kills all tension and eliminates any chance of character development or emotional connections with your viewing audience.Now look, off the bat, I enjoyed the ABC 1994 version, it was a decent adaptation for the time, a bit cheesy sure, but it was fun and had good casting with characters who had solid arcs and it was enjoyable and at least watchable, but it was, as others have rightly said, very much of its time in terms of tone, style and content. A more up to date remake was most welcome, even timely considering the subject matter.The plot follows various American characters as an unknown virus wipes out 95% of the human race while the remaining others are immune. The survivors gravitate towards two opposing forces - one side led by Mother Abigail (the force of good and cool hair) or Randall Flag (The force of bad, but with more drugs and swingers parties taken to eleven) and eventually things are set for a showdown between them. Good vs Evil, lots of religious symbolism, none of which I have an issue with. Mixed in with this are the lives of various characters on both sides of the equation some of whom cross from one side to the other.This new non linear approach to the story is a classic example of: if it isn't broke don't try and fix it. None of the changes that deviate from the narrative of the book work here and the casting all feels off for some reason. Listen there's some good actors in this thing, but the tone, pace and story all fail because of the disjointed narrative and the constant jumping around of timelines destroys any chance of you becoming really invested in any of them. Some of the most important progression dramatic beats and character arcs are completely lost here and it just doesn't work, at all, on any level. So many roles feel so miscast and the actors performances don't really gel nor have any emotive impact because we don't feel nor see a sense of progression. One moment we're in the past, then present, then the future, then back somewhere else, by which time I was wishing for Gary Sinse and Rob Lowe to turn up from the original.The production design feels off too. Yeah dream sequences, can feel weird and out of place, but some of the actual scenes do too. Either one person was given too much power on this show and no one though to rein them in or it was the extremely opposite and it was too many cooks or pulling the narrative and design all over the place. the entire production lacks a cohesive vision. I mean you can literally hear the Producer meetings 'Oh we should this with the timeline, it worked so well in that other show... people will love it."" Well I've got news for you. Stephen King has been around a long long time, and his fanbase were brought up on productions like Salems Lot and Christine, which followed traditional storytelling modus operandi and you know what - it worked.This doesn't. What a colossal waste of talent. There's some good performances here but I honestly will not be tuning in for the future episodes, you lost me on episode.

The Flight Attendant,"""The Flight Attendant"" is not a must-see, but if you do end up seeing it you'll probably have a good time. It is very derivative: from the core concept of the innocent (wo)man being ""in the wrong place at the wrong time"" to a character having conversations with someone who exists only inside their head, there is virtually nothing in this series that hasn't been done many times before (and even many years before). The first few episodes are fast, then the show gets sidetracked by secondary stories which add little, but the finale is reasonably tense and satisfying - maybe too much so (there is at least one character who shouldn't really be alive that somehow makes it). If you don't guess who ""Felix"" is before it is revealed, this is probably your first mystery show....Impressive performances by Kaley Cuoco, who runs the gamut of emotions (this is certainly leagues ahead of her work in ""Big Bang Theory""), and the fabulous Michelle Gomez, wonderful animated opening credits sequence (which I always played twice before the start of each episode).

The first 6 or so episodes definitely keep you intrigued, and it's different from the format of your typical murder mystery (there are more layers beyond the basic ""whodunnit"" that keep you going). My biggest criticism would just be that it tries to do too much--there are too many characters we're supposed to care about for an 8 episode series. But other than that, it's a fun show and a pretty small investment (you can binge it in less than a week).",1,0,1,-999,-999,-999,-999
Elf,"""Elf"" is a pretty cute film--but they're starting to overplay it a bit. Just this Christmas season, it's been on TV 1483857 times (give or take 2). And I worry that being shown so much that folks might have a backlash--might start to hate the film even though it's decent family entertainment and is worth your time.Will Ferrell stars as 'Buddy'--a STRANGE young man indeed. Apparently, as a baby he was accidentally kidnapped and brought back to the North Pole by Santa. Not knowing what to do with the boy so he gave him to an elf (Bob Newhart) to raise as his own. However, he's a terrible elf. Part of it that he's absolutely too big to live as an elf--and part of it is that he's a bit...well....stupid. Eventually, after not fitting in for a very long time, the elves inform Buddy that they now know who his read father is and Buddy leaves the Pole for New York City to find his dad. Once there, Buddy once again does NOT fit in--and makes a mess of most everything. Can Buddy sort all this out and connect with his dad or will the audience leave the theater feeling depressed and miserable (yeah, right!).The film has many funny moments (my favorite was when he exposed FAKE Santa to the kids waiting to see him), a few sweet ones and some very clichéd ones--but I can forgive this, as it IS a family comedy and I am not expecting Shakespeare! Well worth seeing....and a bit odd seeing Ed Asner playing Santa!",0,0,0,-999,-999,-999,-999
Elf,"Elf isn't a perfect Christmas movie, but it was sweet and charming with a great cast. The script can be a little too fluffy and unfocused sometimes though, while the pace occasionally lags and some jokes such as Buddy eating the sweets felt forced. However, it does look terrific, with the locations striking and the cinematography very nice. The soundtrack is a nice addition too, it made me nostalgic and all the more ready for Christmas. The story while simple and a tad predictable is at least original and well-meaning, while the direction is credible. The cast is what gives Elf its staying power and charm. Although I am not a fan of Will Ferrell, I think he really shone here as Buddy, while Zooey Deschannel is beautiful and a huge part of the film's charm, James Caan is a suitably gruff father-like figure and Bob Newhart is wonderful. All in all, it is a sweet film if you forgive the slightly cliché ending, by all means not for all but the cast do save the day. 7/10 Bethany Cox",0,1,0,1,1,1,1
Elf,Orphan Buddy (Will Ferrell) sneaks in Santa (Edward Asner)'s bag and ends up in the North Pole. Papa Elf (Bob Newhart) raises Buddy as an elf. His giantness causes all kinds of problems. Santa allows him to go to New York City to find his birth father Walter Hobbs (James Caan) who is actually on Santa's naughty list. He gets a job at a store and befriends fellow worker Jovie (Zooey Deschanel).Childlike Will Ferrell is giving off so much joy and innocence. He is so silly that it is impossible to not laugh at his slapstick humor. He fully commits and that's what makes it so hilarious. The only minor difficulty lies with James Caan. His personality is way too intense for a wacky comedy. But it picks up whenever he reunites with sweetheart Zooey Deschanel. And he has good fun with his brother Michael. Jon Favreau has created a wacky comedy with a heart.,1,0,0,1,0,0,0
Elf,"Accidentally finding his way into Santa's bad once Christmas Eve, little baby orphan Buddy ends up in the north pole, where he is raised by the elves as one of their own. As he gets ever bigger and less and less suited to the elf lifestyle he is told about his real father and decides to go to New York to find him. However Buddy's natural smile and elfish enthusiasm doesn't really fit in with New York, not to mention a father who rejects him.When I first saw the trailer for this film I laughed slightly but I also thought that it could easily be just awful. Despite this fear I decided to go and see it on the basis of seeing Ferrell in the Reloaded MTV spoof on the DVD and being very funny. I was glad that I did as the film was refreshingly funny very enjoyable despite the weaknesses inherent in a seasonable film of this nature. The jokes are a mix of adult and children - but not separately, the humour is of a nature families can all enjoy rather than being of a `one for me and one for the kids' type.The film does get a little sweet towards the end, but it manages to avoid this usual trap for the majority of the film and can't be expected to not be all Christmas cheer at some point! The fish out of water stuff is pretty funny and Farrell makes his character funny without being annoying to the audience (as he feared he might be from the trailer). Caan is good but has to work with the `scrooge' character of the film and thus gets fewer laughs. The support cast is good with fun turns from Newhart, Asner and Steenburger.It does get a little sickly sweet towards the end and the fish out of water jokes do wear a little thin towards the end but mostly it is very funny and refreshingly fun to watch. The film is made better by a performance from Farrell that is perfectly pitched without being annoying and full of spark and wit.",1,0,0,-999,-999,0,-999
Elf,"The perfect holiday movie for the cynical New Yorker (or anybody from any other metropolis) is so colorful and cheerful, yet not one that will give you a sugar overdose. It's the story of Buddy the elf, Will Ferrell, an actor I normally can't abide. He's an orphan who crawled into Santa's bag and was adopted by bachelor elf Bob Newhart and when he learns the truth of who he is heads to the Big Apple to locate his father, the cynical James Caan, and ends up finding a family.Stepmom Mary Steenburgen (along with Dianne Wiest and Sissy Spacek the perfect on-screen mom) immediately takes to him, half brother Daniel Tay finds a playmate and world weary Zooey Deschanel goes from wanting to kill him on their first meeting to completely entranced by his sweetness. Caan must find the kid in himself to from the Scrooge like publisher to a loving husband and father, and that will take a Christmas miracle.Having not seen this until now, I felt like a complete freeze miser for unintentionally missing it, although I did see the musical on Broadway in 2012. This film pays great tribute to our modern Christmas culture with references to the Franken-Bass TV specials of my childhood and even gets a very funny Keebler elf reference in as well. Who better to play Santa than Ed Asner? He's completely loveable with absolutely no Lou Grant gruffness.One of the funniest gags is the reemergence of the long defunct Gimbles department store where Buddy meets Deschanel and turns the Santa village upside down by redecorating it overnight. When he surprises her in the employee lounge (complete with shower) as she sings ""Baby It's Cold Outside"", it's a magical moment, one of many that starts with the sight of Santa's real village.Everybody is absolutely perfect here, not a false note in the film. So old fashioned in theme but very modern in spirit, this never falters in any way. The ensemble seems to have been magically delicious in loving the script because they are all filled with joy even when acting grumpy like veteran little actor Peter Dinklage, playing one of Caan's prestigious clients whom Ferrell accidentally insults. Putting my own big city cynicism away for the evening, this made me feel like Scrooge the morning after all of his nightmares when the spirit of Christmas returned to him. At times, this can even bring on a tear of joy.",1,0,1,-999,-999,0,-999
Elf,Elf seems to have become a Christmas Classic over the years. The kind of film kids want to see each December along with Home Alone.The premise is rather silly. Will Ferrell is an infant adopted in the North Pole and wrongly thinks he is an elf despite being much taller than the other elves.The naive Ferrell decides to go to New York in search of his real father once he finds out the truth. Dad happens to be the more cynical James Caan who is rather taken aback by a long lost son who thinks he is an elf and maybe borderline retarded.Ferrell gets a job helping out at Santa's grotto in a department store while trying to connect with his father. He also helps the real Santa by getting the public some real Christmas spirit to make his sleigh soar.The film is both silly and charming. Kids will love it but adults may find it a little bit over the top.Ferrell has enough charm to pull off the role.

It is silly and if Will Ferrell knows to do one thing, it is being silly and likeable.Mission accomplished ... but also James Caan, Zoey Deschanel and so many others. It really has a heart of gold, even if you may not see it at first or think it isn't there to begin with. Best watched at Christmas time or around that time and with a younger one.

This falls somewhere in the middle.Hipsters are happy to see Zooey Deschanel in this movie. I am more concerned with why she and Will Ferrell are matched up. If it is not strange enough that she would fall for a seemingly psychotic homeless man, there is a thirteen year age difference. That is just slightly creepy (though not really unheard of).After multiple viewings, I can see how the film is charming in its own way and there are even some subtle nods to Ray Harryhausen and Peter Billingsley.

Elf,"You may expect this film to be a little on the kiddie side, but in fact it it is a great family comedy with jokes for all ages. The story is told by Papa Elf (Bob Newhart), who tells the story of his son. Basically Santa (Edward Asner) was delivering at an orphanage, and a baby managed to get out his crib and crawl into Santa's sack (to get a toy), and he was brought to the North Pole. Papa raised this boy, he named Buddy, as his own, and as he grew he learnt the elf world as if he was one. But it is after he overhears that he is human that Buddy (Will Ferrell) decides he should find his real family. Papa gives him a photo he has kept of his birth father, Walter (James Caan), who deals with book publishing, and is unfortunately on the naughty list. So Buddy sets off to New York, and with his childlike innocence discovers all the wonders of the city. When he does meet Walter, he does not believe he is his son, or in Santa, so till he can get to him again, Buddy stays in the near toy store, where he meets his beautiful love interest, Jovie (Zooey Deschanel). The second time he meets his Dad, Buddy is confirmed from DNA results of his biology, and Walter does eventually let him come home with him to meet wife Emily (Back to the Future Part III's Mary Steenburgen) and son Michael (Daniel Tay). Walter does try to make Buddy more normal by taking him to work, and giving him normal clothes, but his childish behaviour still causes chaos, especially when the employees are talking to short children's book writer Miles Finch (Peter Dinklage), who Buddy keeps calling Elf. Walter loses his patience and sends Buddy away, but when Santa crashes in the middle of central park because he has run low on Christmas spirit to power the sleigh, everyone shows they believe by singing along with Jovie to help, even Scrooge-like Walter. The highlights for me are all of Ferrell, but more especially the snowball fight and the large burp after drinking a whole bottle of Coca Cola in seconds. Good!",1,1,1,0,0,0,1
Elf,"In a concession to my eleven year old granddaughter, I watched ""Elf"" yesterday with her. Quite honestly, I thought she was suggesting ""Alf"" to me, so when she pulled it up on Netflix I managed an inward groan to myself. The end result though, was that I came away pleasantly entertained by the naive innocence of the Elf character Buddy, disarmingly portrayed by Will Ferrell. I don't usually go for pictures starring former SNL comedians because they're usually mindless fluff, but this one had a way of holding your attention to see what silliness comes next. I got a kick out of the sight gags and Buddy's one-sided view of a world he had no knowledge of once he hit New York City on a mission to find his real father. The script writers apparently weren't too concerned about him finding his real mother, a thought that occurred to me throughout, especially with each time that photo of a young Walter Hobbs (James Caan) was shown with his one time girlfriend. But that quickly gets lost in the shuffle of Buddy's precarious encounters with the staff at Gimbel's and Santa's (Ed Asner) arrival fueled by the Christmas Spirit provided by all of Buddy's new found friends and family. I can't really claim that this will wind up a holiday staple with me, but for a one time experience, ""Elf"" will bring a smile. Because in the words of Buddy himself - ""I like to smile. Smiling's my favorite""!",0,1,1,0,0,1,0
Elf,"Charming Christmas confection--about a boy raised by elves in the North Pole who grows up and journeys to N.Y.C. in search of his biological father--puts a clever spin on even the most familiar gags, successfully walking a fine line between absurdist comedy and holiday schmaltz. Will Ferrell looks like a string-bean in yellow tights and, with his mass of curly hair peeking out from underneath his elf's hat, he could easily be used as a walking punchline. Fortunately, director Jon Favreau's handling of ""Elf"" is incredibly nimble, treating Ferrell and his naive character Buddy with the utmost respect; you can laugh at all the silly pranks without ever feeling guilty. Favreau's work is smooth, and he's assembled an incredible supporting cast of character actors to back his star, though some may find the climactic moments (involving Edward Asner as Santa Claus) a bit too literal--and the movie is certainly funnier before we get to this point. Still, the special effects are kept to a minimum in order to let the people shine...and that's not only refreshing, it's heart-warming. *** from ****",1,1,0,1,0,0,1
Elf,"Will Ferrell is one of my favourite movie funny-men, but even so, I had my reservations about Elf: it is a Christmas film after all, and they do have tendency to get rather sappy for my liking.Still, I put aside my doubts, and to start with, I admit I had a chuckle-some time, with Will providing some amusing 'fish-out-of-water' moments as wide-eyed innocent Buddy, the titular 'elf' (in reality, a human adopted when a baby by one of Santa's workers) who leaves North Pole to travel to New York, where he hopes to find his real father (played by James Caan).Unfortunately, the makers of this film just can't help themselves, and gradually allow over-sentimentality to take control, before unloading a whole sackful of saccharine sweet clichés in the final act: Buddy's mean, inconsiderate father miraculously transforms into a loving dad; good old Santa pops up needing some Christmas spirit to power his sleigh; and everyone starts singing carols and being all happy and stuff! Hell, Buddy even gets the girl (pretty shop assistant Jovie, played by Zooey Deschanel). Gag! A bit of cheesy schmaltz is to be expected this time of year, but this amount in one massive dose is just too much for me to handle.I rate Elf an unexceptional 5.5 out of 10, very generously bumped up to 6 because, hey, it's Christmas!!!.",0,0,0,0,0,-999,0

It wasnt until part way in I realised she was being played by a black actress. I thought she was amazing actually her face said it all. She obviously loved her husband but had no idea how to deal with his madness and everytime she could she should visit him in more lucid moments. It must have been quite hard for her to deal with.Then she meets the beautiful and flawless Daphne Bridgerton. It was then I was slowly introduced to the family. Daphne an innocent who was meeting the Queen on her coming out. With comments of the queen one would expect Daphne to have a queue of suitors, well she did sort of but sadly her over proective brother ruined that for her.The story is slow unfolding we get to meet all the main characters, and their stories enrwine within the story. We get to meet the family the Bridgertons i loved the mother, and Eloise too, and the eldester brother who was lost as he just had no idea how to run a family and was besotted with an opera singer. Benedict Bridgerton bored of society who slipped quietly into the unknown world of gay, and orgies and arists. Colin a quiet young man kind.then we met The Duke and i fell in love lol.

Bridgerton,"The intrigue of Bridgerton comes from its tangled ecosystem of friends, frenemies, suitors, and voyeurs. The most exciting moments often come not from scenes of bombast but in the whispers that shape the season. There are men in this story, all of whom are interesting and often deeply alluring, but this is a show most concerned with the plight and passions of women. It does not feel the need to force high-concept drama or unnecessarily soapy details into their lives to make them interesting. There are romps in the meadows, kisses in the rain, and meddling mothers at tea-time, and it is all executed with such delicate flair that Bridgerton makes the usual fresh again. This is not just a show that takes its own concept seriously: It's one that respects the romance genre as a whole, and I cannot tell you how much of a relief it is to see that, especially given how widely ignored or derided romance novels are by the cultural mainstream. Van Dusen has enough trust in both his source material and the very concept of a Regency romance saga. The show gives every character in this vast ensemble room to breathe and the attention their unique plights deserve.
Creator Van Dusen makes Bridgerton's many twists and turns satisfying to the end, even when they're predictable, and the young cast of mostly unknowns brings zip and depth of feeling to material that could otherwise feel slight. There's a charming wink to it all - this is a show that knows exactly what it is, and wears its corset proudly.",1,1,1,0,0,1,1

It's a handsome series - the Bath settings are thoughtfully and artfully reproduced, and the plot is better than average with a whole string of Bridgerton siblings needed to be married off. Everybody seems to happily live with what seems like the double standards of the era, and Julie Andrews' Lady Whistledown is a plot masterstroke.

The Crown,"Love historical dramas, and it fascinated me just as much to see one centred around (as of now) our longest reigning monarch, a title that for a long time was given to Queen Victoria. There was so much talent involved that my interest was sparked further, despite admittedly not being the biggest fan of Netflix. 'The Crown' turned out to be a wonderful series, at its very best some of the best television seen in a while and in a completely different league to much of anything else Netflix has done (so much so that it had to be a check to see that it definitely came from Netflix). Season 1 was so well executed in every regard, while Season 2 boasted even richer material. Totally get the adoration, while sharing some viewers' misgivings about the inaccuracies and some biased and distorted characterisations (the Duke and Duchess of Windsor coming off worst). Vanessa Kirby for my tastes was a bit too annoying as Margaret as well. However, the great things far eclipse the not so good. When 'The Crown' was great, it was the very meaning of a crowning achievement. It couldn't have been any more classy and sumptuous visually. The photography and production and costume design are evocative and a sight to behold. The music for me wasn't too intrusive or low-key and was beautiful scoring on its own. The main theme is not easy to forget. Writing probes a lot of thought and intrigue, it is much more than soap-opera and doesn't feel too modern (not like 'Victoria'). Loved the intimacy and subtle tension of the storytelling in each episode, the deliberate pace in no way a hindrance, and the character chemistry scintillates. The characters are very compellingly written, with enough balance in characterisation to overshadow the instances of one-sidedness and most of them have more than one layer. Cannot find many qualms with the acting. Claire Foy is dignity and class personified and Matt Smith acts every bit as splendidly with lots of authority. One of the biggest standouts of the near-uniformly strong support (Kirby being the exception) is the powerhouse that is John Lithgow, so much so that one can look past misgivings of him not being quite right physically (being too tall for one by nearly a foot, Churchill was not a tall man). Overall, deserving of the acclaim it's garnered. Not quite perfect but really quite wonderful and something of an achievement. 9/10 Bethany Cox",1,1,1,1,1,1,1

The Crown,"The most expensive series in the history of Netflix, The Crown is a 10- part series about the early years of Elizabeth as Queen, and the effect that her rule had on her husband and sister.As the niece of the King, Elizabeth and her sister Margaret enjoyed all the perks of royalty without being in line for the throne. This ended when King Edward (Alex Jennings) abdicated. Having no issue, his brother Bertie (Jared Harris) became George VI. While Elizabeth (Claire Foy) and her husband, Prince Philip (Matt Smith) were in Africa, King George died. And greatness was thrust upon the shoulders of Elizabeth.The series shows Elizabeth's adjustment, her dealings with people like Winston Churchill, Anthony Eden, her Uncle David, the ex-King and now Duke of Windsor, and learning ultimately that there was a procedure, and while she ruled, she needed to follow the decisions of others.One of her biggest family problems concerned her sister Margaret (Vanessa Kirby) and her affair with a divorced man, Peter Townsend (Ben Miles). It's hard to imagine nowadays how scandalous divorce was, and in this case, worse because it looked like Townsend had left his wife for Margaret. This caused many problems for the Crown and between the sisters. Sadder yet, though the relationship was broken up, Margaret ended up divorced herself. There were also issues with Philip piloting - it seemed as if many family matters had to be approved of at a higher level. It must have been very frustrating. (Divorce was still an issue when Jacqueline Kennedy was invited to the Palace, and the Palace refused to let her bring her divorced sister Lee. ""But she's my host,"" Jacqueline objected, ""and my sister!"" Couldn't bring her.)The series spares nothing in terms of opulence, the copying of actual gowns worn and other fashion looks of the era, and manages to work in actual footage of the coronation as people watched it on black and white television. The actors do a magnificent job, particularly Claire Foy who somehow IS the young Elizabeth; John Lithgow as Winston Churchill, Matt Smith as Philip, Alex Jennings as the Duke of Windsor. Though Vanessa Kirby is a wonderful Margaret, the real Margaret was actually more beautiful, though Kirby shows her flirtatious personality and charisma. Foy and Kirby also demonstrate beautifully the subtle and not-so-subtle moments of rivalry between the two women.In terms of historical accuracy, from what I know, the series is accurate with a few caveats. One isn't really the fault of the production. It's said that Churchill's wife had the portrait that Sutherland did of her husband destroyed and supervised the destruction; in truth, the servants took it upon themselves to burn it as it was just somewhere taking up space. Clementine is reported to have said, ""That's what I would have done.""Also, the Duchess of Windsor was not present during King George's abdication speech. I believe the story of Churchill and his secretary was fictionalized to bring in his awareness of the hospital problems.The producers worked very hard to make The Crown as accurate as possible, working with historians, biographers, someone who actually worked in the Palace, newsreels, and newspapers.

The Crown,"One of those shows that was massively hyped when it started and now seems to exist quietly in the background, loved by only a few.For me it lacks total historical accuracy, the people playing the key figures never look anything like them, and it's all a bit soap opera-esque.",0,-1,0,0,0,-999,0
The Crown,"It is a testament to how good this series is that a dramatization of such a well known person and such well known events could be so mesmerizing. The detail is just mind boggling. There is such painstaking detail to recreate each scene from Commonwealth tours to minor ones. The sets are sumptuous and the costumes are perfect. No wonder it cost so much to make. The writing is superb with such good dialog in the intimate scenes that one only imagined before. Just finished season 1, all 10 episodes and each one is better than the last. Quite shocking to see on screen (even though it is known) is the vitriolic hatred Edward VIII had for the rest of the Windsors due to the treatment of Wallis.Some of the outstanding aspects of this first season are the handling of marriage with divorced persons - both with Edward VIII and Wallis Simpson and with Princess Margaret's love for the divorced Peter Townsend. A well handled angle is the difficult position the Queen finds herself in. Even marital conflict is shown with Prince Philip portrayed rather negatively. Do feel more sympathy for the Queen after watching this series.The flaw in this series is the jarring miscasting of some of the characters. Jared Harris looks too different from George VI and the actress who plays the Queen Mother is also terribly miscast - she should have been a plumper more round looking actress. They don't capture their essences. Vanessa Kirby is a bit indelicate for Margaret - maybe a bit large. Claire Foy does a good imitation of the Queen's accent but she has a rather hesitant look - more suitable for the household staff than the Queen. She doesn't look regal. But maybe she will change later. Physically her face is rather too different. Surprisingly Matt Smith the weird actor from Dr Who although uglier than Prince Phillip does capture his essence. John Lithgow even though too tall acts so well as Churchill it's quite award worthy. But the errors in casting don't prevent this series being outstanding television.",1,-1,1,1,0,1,1
The Crown,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningSEASON 4After the political assassination of her brother Lord Mountbatten (Charles Dance) at the hands of the IRA, Queen Elizabeth II (Olivia Colman) must brave the dawning of a new age. As Britain elects its first female Prime Minister, in the shape of the divisive Margaret Thatcher (Gillian Anderson), whose policies throw the country in to turmoil, Elizabeth watches as her son Charles (Josh O'Connor) strikes up a relationship with Diana Spencer (Emma Corrin), a commoner with her own free spirited will that throws the traditional royal style in to disarray, which blossoms into a tumultuous marriage that bears two children but becomes a desperate facade.It says something that I've come in to The Crown on Season Four, as being no royalist, nothing appealed to me about watching the previous three. However, the 1980s was a funky, transformative period, from the music, to the fashion, to what were then current events going on, and that made the new season look all that more irresistible. The show has been hitting the headlines recently, with some calling for a disclaimer, stating that it's a fictionalised account of real events, but in an age with 'celebrities' baring all in reality shows, the Royals remain elusive to the public, leaving any portrayal of them open to any wild speculation that can be dreamt up.There are many who cling to the saintliness of Diana, especially since her death, about her selflessness and compassion, and how she was too good for the snooty, cold royals (with some even theorizing her untimely end in the Paris tunnel may have been less of a tragic accident and more a calculated bumping off!), and this show certainly plays to that impression. All the more wonderful, then, that in one of three powerhouse female performances, Corrin captures her shyness and vulnerability so perfectly, while Colman fits the skin of the queen to a tee, and Anderson absolutely nails the determination and conviction of Thatcher.There was never a more explosive time in British politics and culture than the 1980s, and with such an iconic time serving as the backdrop, and with such magnificent performances, something I wouldn't normally be interested in has proven to be quite a pleasant surprise. ****",1,1,0,0,1,1,0

The Crown,"(Flash Review)If you ever wanted to get an inside scoop into how the royal family truly functions, this is a prime example as I'm pretty sure this is mostly true to history. It follows Queen Elizabeth II from a young princess as she grows into 'the crown' as Queen. Each episode focuses on a nicely contained subject or event and all details are true to period and highly accurate. You get a neat perspective to see how the Queen interacts with the Prime Minister (played amazingly by John Lithgow) and parliament, her sister, husband and parents. As well as her uncle, The King, who abdicated the thrown for his love, who had two previous husbands, making her ineligible to be his queen. There is also a surprising amount of power or influence given to those in charge of maintaining tradition and honor to the family lineage and to the crown. Great pacing, smart dialog, high quality production value and it is very engaging as the acting, dialog and episode scripts are spot on.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1

The Crown,"Matt Smith, who played the role of Philip, Duke of Edinburgh was definitely a horribly wrong cast, even the records shown that he was indeed a womanizer and adulterer when he was young, but casting this Matt Smith, with a long and narrow face, always slant to one side neck, street-thug like walking attitude, more like a clown or jerk instead, a cave-in crescent cucumber face always with a low class mockery smile-like sneer, and worst of all, such a terrible actor to play this important role, I simply couldn't hold myself too keen to watch this series and would tried every way to skip forward every time when he appeared. In China, there's an old saying: ""A rat dropping will soil a whole pot of porridge."" This is exactly what I felt when Matt Smith's face first shown on the screen. Boy oh boy, what an ugly dropping. Another ridiculous thing happened in the 1st episode was when these royal couple changing vows to each other: ""....For better or worse; for richer or poorer..."" Jesus, I just couldn't help laughing out loud! Do you really and seriously think these specific part of the vow could be appropriately applied to the first family of England? Their future could only be Better and Richer and nothing else, folks. So this was a practical joke to a commoner like me.But except this unfit cast to play this important historical role, this drama series indeed is grandeur magnificently made.An afterthought immediately after finished watching S01E09:If compare Jeff Daniel in ""Godless"" with John Lithgow, who played Winston Churchill in this series, John Lithgow should have won the Best Leading Actor instead in this year's Emmy's Award. The role Jeff Daniel's performed in Godless, in my opinion, was good but not great. What Lithgow had shown us is not only great but perfect. His acting talent is at a genius level.

The Crown,"Being right in the middle of season 4, I find it very difficult to express a global judgment for the series as a whole. I wasn't even sure if I cared to watch this, being not interested in the least in the British royal family.However, the first two seasons were intriguing and showed some unexpected sides of the family. Obviously, one should always consider that a good part of this is fiction, however, the feelings and behaviour of those involved are believable and there is a development of characters that make sense compared to whatever we know about them from ""real life"".More than Elizabeth, I found the characters and background of Philip and Margaret developed in a way that makes one almost - but not quite - sympathise with them. Philip was a sort of mongrel, second-rate royal, who grew up without the care of a proper family and ended up playing second fiddle to a queen. In a privileged environment, but still second rate all his life.The same applies to the abrasive and controversial figure of Margaret. Her dismal love story with Townsend seemed to have failed more because of her clinging to her status than for the meddling of her bothersome family. However, this point is dismissed in the series, with the family getting most of the blame.Finally, the Duke of Windsor saga is also presented in a somehow romantic light, but in reality, witnesses to the events claim that ""David"" was not keen at all about reigning and that he was clingy and weak and Simpson offered him a magnificent excuse to drop out of his responsibilities. He might have lived to regret it, but for sure his great ""love story"" was no picnic nor so great as depicted.After many historically charged episodes, the third series was drab and dull, with older Elizabeth by Olivia Colman nowhere near as charismatic as her younger version. Episode after episode of strikes, desperate miners and local tragedies, with grey and boring supporting actors, the only spark provided by older Margaret and her domestic crisis.Finally, series 4 started much stronger that the previous one, but being right in the middle of it, I am afraid the Diana saga will eat up most of the screen time.",0,0,0,0,-999,-999,0
How the Grinch Stole Christmas,"Other than Babe: Pig in the City and Santa Clause Conquers the Martians, I can't think of a more detestable kids pic than this.

Yeah, well maybe after he had an aneurysm!! Come on, lady. Just be truthful and instead say ""it's dog drool and the Doc is spinning in his grave like a rotisserie--BUT MAN WILL YA' LOOK AT ALL THE MONEY THEY GAVE ME?!?!?!??"".I base this on the basic fact that the entire message of the book and wonderful TV special is: The GRINCH HATES XMAS and the People of Whoville know the REAL reason and joy of the holiday. Now with this crappy movie it's: The Grinch rightfully hates XMAS because it's been over-commercialized by the selfish people of Whoville. Huh?!?!?! This is the complete OPPOSITE of Seuss' vision and his widow has the nerve to say it was what HE wanted?!?! This was the most overblown and over-hyped movie. With $10000000000000 dollars spent on advertising and marketing (and $6.79 for writing), it's no wonder the movie made money!!! Kids can't help but see Grinch paraphernalia EVERYWHERE and demand to see the movie. BUT, to the parents of Planet Earth we have a solution to movies like this---Tell your kids NO!!!!! Then take them for a walk or go fishing or beat each other senseless with tire irons--it would STILL be better than going to see bloated MEGA-crap like this!UPDATE: I have an Italian friend who likes the film. When we talked about it, I understood why. He had never read the book nor seen the wonderful cartoon versions--and the message in them is the exact opposite of this movie.

How the Grinch Stole Christmas,"Of course it isn't as good as the animated classic, an immensely charming, beautifully animated gem, that is a family Christmas favourite. I will admit I was a bit sceptical of the remake, but other than some slow scenes in the middle half and a patchy script, this film is surprisingly good. Honestly if you thought this is terrible, and I completely respect anyone who thinks that, I warn you Cat in the Hat was much worse, and gets my vote as the worst Dr Seuss adaptation ever. How The Grinch stole Christmas is very colourful, with great set design, and an unrecognisable Jim Carrey was terrific as the Grinch, he was actually really funny, not like Mike Myers who was miscast as the cat in Cat in The Hat. Everyone else was fine too, particularly the girl, and while he is no Boris Karloff Antony Hopkins does a good job as the narrator. The script is patchy in places, but there are a number of very funny bits, and it was nice having some character context about the Grinch. All in all, a colourful, well performed film, not as good as the 1966 animated classic,and flawed it is, but actually one of the better Dr Seuss adaptations. 8/10 Bethany Cox",1,1,0,1,1,1,0
How the Grinch Stole Christmas,"With such an iconic 1966 animated 1/2 hour special, it's hard to imagine a reason to reimagine it as a live action movie. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. I'm not particularly angry or hate this. It's just that I couldn't stop asking Why? This one gives a backstory to the origin of the Grinch. He gets delivered by mistake to Whoville. The kids bully him because of his looks. In frustration, he runs away to live on the mountain. Now he is a fully grown loner. Cindy Lou Who (Taylor Momsen) is searching for the meaning of Christmas. She tries to see the good in the Grinch, and keeps trying to bring the spirit of Christmas to him. But the Grinch just can't get into the spirit.I don't have a big problem with the additional backstory or the greater role for Cindy Lou Who. That's to be expected for an expanded Grinch. And Taylor Momsen is a perfectly good child actor. But none of it excites me. The visual design is again expected but without the outlandishness of 'The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T.' for instance. However it is still great once we get to the last part where the Grinch tries to steal Christmas. All the sentiments are there voiced especially by Cindy Lou Who's father. That part still works.

How the Grinch Stole Christmas,"Jim Carrey is really fun, though his canon does include some clunkers. I really wanted to like this film, but with all the bells and whistles and Carrey's mugging, it just got dull. Because it is from the Grinch's perspective, the events seem cruel. The humor is juvenile and unoriginal. It has that anything-for-a-laugh being to it. What carries it to a point is that it is a good story. But it is not enough. I guess when someone does a sequel, even if it is a feature film updating a cartoon, it needs to take it to the next level, to put some new and original spin on it. I'm not even saying it's terrible; I give it a six. But a few days after seeing it, I really took nothing with me.",0,1,0,0,0,1,0
How the Grinch Stole Christmas,"In the land of Whoville everyone loves Christmas and count down the whole year until that wonderful time. However just outside Whoville lives the Grinch, a green hairy twisted creature that hates, and always has hated, Christmas and was rejected by the Who's as a child. A young girl from Whoville sets out to befriend the Grinch and help him find his love of Christmas but, when it goes wrong early on, the Grinch becomes even more rotten and plans to ruin it for everyone.I have never read the book or seen the original animated version of this story, but I do enjoy a bit of Dr Seuss and was worried about how such imagination would be filled out on the screen. The film actually manages it very well and the whole film has the look of the books, even if it lacks soul at times. The plot is stretched out to the running time and could have easily been shorter and punchier, but at heart it is a good little moral that is good from Christmas time.However, aside from the look of the film, the main reason that the film works is Jim Carrey. I cannot think of another actor who could have pulled off this role as well as he did. He is manic and really funny although I imagine that if you dislike him and his antics that you'd hate the film totally. I'm on the fence about him but I did enjoy him here. Momsen is OK but really just a `cute kid' and, while the support cast has quite a few famous faces, they don't make much of an impact under the makeup and the film is left to Carrey to save it - which he happily does.Overall this film is a little too long and padded out, but while Carrey is onscreen it seems to go pretty fast due to his hyper acting and comedy antics. However, it's Christmas and it has a nice message while not totally giving in to syrupy sentiment (thanks again to manic Carrey) and it's just perfect for kids and adults at Christmas time.",0,0,-1,0,0,-999,0

How the Grinch Stole Christmas,"During his heyday as a comic film star, it was expected that a Jim Carey movie would be over-the-top with his antics, especially if he was playing a milquetoast character who suddenly got some gumption to stop being picked on. With ""The Grinch"" and ""The Mask"", Carey went overboard with the antics, reminding me of that attention seeking kid who could break people up laughing with their silly faces and funny voices but never knew when to stop. In other words, he's perfect for roles like this, yet after a while it can become pretty tiring.As the Grinch, he gives an over cafineated performance, frenetic and sly, barely stopping to get a breath. Of course a lot of that is in the makeup and costume, special effects and the editing, but no one else in 2000 could play that role. This isn't the quiet menace of the Boris Karloff cartoon but something a lot more complex, some of which works and some of which can be eye rolling.The direction by Ron Howard is decent but there's so much going on that you may feel forced to watch it every other Christmas or so to gather it all up. It's beautiful to look at and often funny (especially his love of raw onions), but there's a bit of cloying nonsense with the character of Cindy Lou Who, unfortunately not always easy to understand, especially when she sings.Bill Irwin, Christine Baranski and Jeffrey Tambor provide a few of the familiar faces with Anthony Hopkins almost sounding like Karloff. This must have been a magical set to see for the first time for those involved, and certainly the first viewing can bring on a lot of ooh's and ah's. The town of Whoville though isn't presented as the perfect Christmas town even though it's obvious their favorite holiday. Certain individuals are grinches in their own right.

I watched this back to back with the newer Grinch (and saw on imdb there is another Grinch movie with Bela Lugosi? Another one for the have to watch someday list) and it made it obvious that this is not as good as the newer version - at least to me.Having said all that, the movie is still funny and just for Carey it really is more than worthwhile.

How the Grinch Stole Christmas,"Big budget remake of the classic cartoon about a creature (Jim Carrey) intent on stealing Christmas.I had rather low expectations for this one... not sure why, as it turned out to be quite good. I just wanted to add a few thoughts here.First of all, Taylor Momsen nailed the Cindy Lou Who part. She has gone on to bigger, better things (""Gossip Girl"") and good for her. Second, Ron Howard nailed the look of a Seussian world. The faces, the architecture, it all seems so right and I think the good doctor would have approved. I heard that Tim Burton was approached to direct, and I think he would have done a fine job, but how do you beat this? And last, Jim Carrey. Wow. He has had some good and bad career decisions, and this has to be among his best. The physical comedy, the improvised jokes, it was like the role he was born to play. The other choices were Jack Nicholson and Eddie Murphy. Nicholson could possibly have done it ten years earlier, but did he have that range of motion in 2000? And Eddie Murphy? Maybe, maybe not. This was a Carrey role inside and out.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1

The little girl in here, ""Cindy Lou Who"" (Taylor Momsen) is really cute and the costumes and hairdos of the little people in here are fun to view. Anthony Hopkins' voice is pleasing, too, so having his narrate this elevates the movie further.

How the Grinch Stole Christmas,"This was the second version of the famous story by Dr. Suess, following the 1966 Chuck Jones/Boris Karloff cartoon, a big-budget live action adaptation, produced by Brian Grazer, directed by Ron Howard (Splash, Parenthood, Ransom, A Beautiful Mind). Basically the Whos down in Whoville are preparing for Christmas, everyone is excited to be buying gifts, decorations and food. Seven-year-old Cindy Lou Who (Taylor Momsen) feels however everyone is missing the point about Christmas, going overboard with festive items, rather than personal relationships. While on top of Mount Crumpit lives the hairy, green creature the Grinch (Golden Globe nominated Jim Carrey), he is feared by all the townspeople, he has a heart two sizes too small, and he really hates Christmas. Cindy Lou encounters the Grinch when he comes down the mountain into town to create trouble in the Post Office, she is initially scared, until he reluctantly saves her from being crushed in a packaging machine. She becomes curious about the Grinch, and asks townspeople about his history, she asks many people in town what they know about him. The Grinch had a tragic past, as a baby he was adopted by two spinsters, he showed sadistic tendencies as a child, but was not cruel as he would later become. In school, the eight-year-old Grinch (Josh Ryan Evans) had a crush on classmate Martha May Whovier (Landry Allbright), but his rival Augustus May Who (Ben Bookbinder) teased him about his hairiness. One year, the Grinch makes Martha a gift, he also attempts to shave his face, the next day his classmates laugh at him for his face cuts, he loses his temper, destroys the gift and trashes the classroom, and exiled himself to the top of Mount Crumpit, never to be seen again. Touched by this story, Cindy Lou decides to nominate the Grinch to be the Christmas Whobilation ""Holiday Cheermeister"", to the displeasure of Augustus May Who, now the mayor of Whoville. She climbs to the top of Mount Crumpit and invites the Grinch to the Whobilation, he initially declines, but reconsiders hearing about an award, and that Martha May (Christine Baranski) will be at the celebration. As Cheermeister, the Grinch endures wearing an ugly sweater and judging all the Whos' Christmas food concoctions, but he enjoys being unsportsmanlike and beating children in the competitions. The Mayor reminds the Grinch of his childhood humiliation, giving him an electric shaver as a present, and publicly proposing marriage to Martha May, and offering her a new car on the side. In response, the Grinch berates the Whos about the Christmas festivities, saying it is all about the gifts, most will end up in the garbage which is dumped on Mount Crumpit near his home. He proceeds to ruin the party, burning down the town Christmas tree and causing chaos. Cindy Lou is shamed by the Mayor, but the Whos have a spare tree, which they put up after the Grinch leaves. The Grinch wants Christmas to end once and for all, it is when he sees his dog Max (Kelley, voiced by Frank Welker) with snow on his face, like the beard of Santa Claus, he gets a wonderful, awful idea. He concocts a plan to steal all the Christmas presents, decorations and food from the Whos, he creates a Santa Claus suit and hat, building a powered sleigh, and sticking an antler on Max's head to become a reindeer. The first house the Grinch goes to is Cindy Lou's house, she catches him as he is stealing the Christmas tree, but he lies to her, as Santa, that he is taking it to be fixed at his workshop. The Grinch continues house to house stealing everything Christmassy, packing it into a bag in the back of the sleigh, and gets it back to the top of Mount Crumpit, ready to dump it. The Grinch listens out for the cries of the Whos when they wake up on Christmas morning, the Mayor blames Cindy Lou for what the Grinch has done, but her father Lou Lou Who (Bill Irwin) defends her, saying that Christmas is not all about the gifts, it is about family. Before the Grinch pushes the sleigh of Christmas goods off the edge of the cliff, he hears the happy singing of the Whos, he is puzzled that he has not stopped Christmas from coming. Then he realises, Christmas means more than judt what comes from a store, it means a little bit more, and in this moment, his heart grows three sizes. He sees the sleigh is about to fall from the mountain, he is unable to stop it, but then he sees Cindy Lou on top of the load, this motivates him to save not just the gifts but a life, he finds the strength to lift the sleigh. The Grinch and Cindy Lou ride the sleigh back to town to return the gifts, the Grinch confesses to stealing Christmas and apologises, surrendering himself to the police. Officer Wholihan (Jim Meskimen) lets him go, and Martha May turns down the Mayor's proposal, handing back his diamond ring, as heart belongs to the Grinch. In the end, the Grinch joins Cindy Lou and all the Whos in a singalong, and he has the honour of carving the roast beast for the large feast. Narrated by Sir Anthony Hopkins, also starring Molly Shannon as Betty Lou Who, Clint Howard (Ron's brother) as Whobris, Mindy Sterling as Clarnella, Rachel Winfree as Rose, Rance Howard (Ron's father) as Elderly Timekeeper, Jeremy Howard as Drew Lou Who, T.J. Thyne as Stu Lou Who, Deep Roy as Post Office Clerk, Rain Pryor (Richard's daughter) as Shopper, Verne Troyer as Band Member, Rick Baker as Puppeteer, Bryce Dallas Howard as Surprised Who and Ron Howard as Whoville Townsperson. Carrey is almost unrecognisable under the makeup as the hairy, green pest, he really laps up being mean and causing havoc, Momsen is cute, and Tambor and Baranski do their parts well, and the narration by Hopkins is nice. It sticks to the basic story of the mountain dweller who hates everything festive and plans to steal it, the extension seeing the lead creature's past, why he hates Christmas and other bits and pieces works, it deserved the awards for brilliant makeup for Carrey in his green getup and everything with their noses, the costumes, sets and props are likeably weird, kooky and colourful, and Carrey sings an amusing version of ""You're a Mean One, Mr. Grinch"", it is dark in moments and might be a little much for children, but you will find yourself laughing a lot, and feel the Christmas spirit, a wondeful seasonal fantasy comedy. It won the Oscar for Best Makeup, and it was nominated for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration and Best Costume Design, and it won the BAFTA for Best Make Up/Hair.

How the Grinch Stole Christmas,"Despite the misgivings one may initially have about Hollywood turning the still-satisfying animated TV special from Dr. Seuss' book into a big-budget live-action feature, fear not over the look of the piece. Director Ron Howard and his artists have really captured the visual essence of the classic show, and one couldn't possibly hope for a better-looking movie based upon a Seuss story. Jim Carrey is marvelously cast as the Grinch, a green, furry, Christmas-hating malcontent who lives atop a snowy hill overlooking Whoville, although the inhabitants of Whoville present a problem. With make-up designs causing everyone to resemble relatives of Wallace Shawn, distinctive (or likable) personalities were apparently difficult to come by. In expanding this whole scenario, screenwriters Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman were unable to retain the angelic (some may argue, cloying) passivity in Whoville. We now get a Mayor who's a self-serving jerk, a Christmas lights contest between neighbors, and children who laugh and jeer at a moppet version of the Grinch in a very odd flashback sequence. Howard's attentions as a filmmaker begin to wander after a promising opening; he becomes exhausted by the material itself--the bombast wears him out--perhaps causing a few of his quieter moments to flag (particularly an awful sequence with Carrey having fun with his echo, later munching on shattered glass). Bits and pieces work crazy magic, though Howard is no Tim Burton and doesn't always grasp the deliciousness in the macabre undermining (he's too anxious to be funny). Anthony Hopkins narrates in commendable fashion, and there are some marvelous scenes, but interest for adults should wane after the first hour. ** from ****",1,1,1,1,1,1,1
How the Grinch Stole Christmas,"It's amazing all that goes on, inside a normal snowflake! I found the DVD of this movie on the shelves of my local county library, and brought it home to watch with my 14-year-old neighbors, Emily and Natalie. Jim Carrey is perfect as the Grinch. It's a story that has been around for a long time, everyone knows it. The critic Ebert describes the movie fairly accurately, but gives it a lower rating than I do. Aside from Carrey, I especially enjoyed Bill Irwin, a virtually unknown and underrated actor who has great body movements and facial expressions. The DVD is of course sharp and colorful with great 5.1 sound. It also has a number of very nice extras for those of us who like to go behind the scenes to see how a film was made.

Die Hard,"Even if the non-action parts are a tad slow in comparison, that is more than compensated by so many things that makes Die Hard so brilliant.For one thing the action is explosive and consistently exciting, and the cinematography is astounding being very inventive and colourful. John McTiernon(The Hunt for Red October, Last Action Hero) directs briskly and efficiently, and the pacing a vast majority of the time is exhilarating.Then there is a terrific score by Michael Kamen, some intelligent and witty scripting and a plot that doesn't feel forced or convoluted. Not to mention some excellent acting. As good as Bruce Willis is, yes his character is somewhat two-dimensional, but he is also resourceful and world-weary and Willis handles this really well, it is Alan Rickman who steals the acting honours as Hans Gruber. Gruber is cold, calculating, suave and menacing, in my opinion only Rickman could do justice to such a character. Overall, a superb movie, not only the best of the Die Hard franchise but one of the best of the action genre. 10/10 Bethany Cox",1,1,1,1,0,1,1
Die Hard,"Die Hard (1988) *** (out of 4)Enjoyable and tense thriller about a group of terrorists (led by Alan Rickman) who overtake a L.A. skyscraper and the only thing keeping them from getting away with their crime is a New York police officer (Bruce Willis) there on vacation. There's a lot of very good things about this movie but I've always thought that the majority of the credit has to go to star Willis. He might not have been a A-list star at the time this was released but it's easy to see why he became one afterwards. I think what's so great about him and the character he plays is that we can believe he's just your typical guy you'd see walking around on the streets with you. That every-day-man quality that Willis has works so well here because of the odds stacked against his character you can't help but just sit back and enjoy this one person taking out a professional organization. The hilarious one-liners, the smart remarks and the way Willis makes himself know to the terrorists is just classic and we get so many great showdowns that you can't help enjoy all of them. It certainly doesn't hurt that you've got a strong supporting cast with Rickman being a villain you just love to hate. The coldness RIckman brings to the part is the perfect contrast to Willis' cop and it works perfectly. Reginald VelJohnson, William Atherton, Bonnie Bedelia and Paul Gleason also add great support for Willis to play off of. The action scenes are certainly some of the best you're going to see and what holds them together so well is the direction by John McTiernan. He perfectly blends the humor, tension and the action but he also gives the film a wonderful pace that keeps it moving at a fast rate. DIE HARD might be far-fetched in what one man is able to do but this really doesn't take away from any of the fun.",1,1,1,1,1,1,0
Die Hard,"This original action classic has been hugely influential over the years - and it's no surprise, as it's one of the best action thrillers ever made. New meaning is brought to the word ""action"" as here it is exhilarating, furious and nothing less than exciting. The premise is simple: one location, one good guy and twelve bad guys. Cue lots of explosions, fist fights, blood, violence, and plenty of shooting too. The thrills come from the suspense of Willis using his wits as well as his brawn to fight the bad guys and save the hostages.When watching this film what becomes immediately apparent is how fresh it is. This hasn't been filmed with some cheap cameras for a quick buck, it looks professional and couldn't be less polished. The photography is clear and brings out the best of the surroundings, while the music has obviously been carefully chosen to convey the right mood. And, strangely enough for an action film, the acting is actually very good. Unheard of, as remember this was back in the days where Schwarzenegger and Stallone were the top stars of the action genre. Bruce Willis excels as the wisecracking, sardonic cop, and you can't fail to like him. He's consistently witty and provides a powerful presence when needed - it comes as no surprise as he lived off this image for the next six or seven years.The supporting cast aren't half bad, either. The reliable Bonnie Bedelia takes a break from her usual highbrow, ""moral dilemma"", television movie fare as Willis' tough wife, while Reginald Veljohnson is also great as a sympathetic cop - you just want to hug him. But most memorable of all is Alan Rickman for his excellent turn as the cool, calculating terrorist with a carefully-crafted German accent and a fine line in natty suits. Rickman is THE bad guy of modern cinema, watch any subsequent action film with terrorists and you'll see people trying to be him. He's that good. The rest of the cast of terrorists have all been picked for their imposing looks, and they're not bad either. Keep your eyes peeled for fearsome Bond baddie Robert Davi in a minor role as an FBI man.As well as the tense running around in corridors and stand-offs between Willis and the various creeps, this film really delivers in the action stakes. The guys here really do look like they are trying their hardest to kill each other, and we get people flying down stairs, getting chains wrapped around their necks, getting shot all over the place. Every kill that Willis makes is original and exciting. There are also plenty of ace stunts, like when Willis jumps off an exploding roof with only a fire hose tied around his waist. The gore level is high, graphic in fact, with people being shot apart wherever you look, and it's definitely a film for all cinema fans to enjoy. Consistently entertaining and strong enough to withstand repeated viewings, this is the first and final word on the ""one guy versus lots of bad guys"" sub-genre of the action flick.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1
Die Hard,"The world has a new hero. John McClane (Bruce Willis) is a NYPD officer who's come to LA to reconcile with his wife Holly (Bonnie Bedelia). They're at her employer's Christmas party when the building is taken over by German terrorist Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman).John McClane isn't your regular 80s muscle bound superhuman hero. He's the everyman. He bleeds. He suffers. He wisecracks. He can talk in full sentences. He uses his brain as much as his muscles. He's just in the wrong place at the wrong time.The action is big and grandiose. It takes the adage that bigger is better to its limits. Unlike Schwarzenegger and Stallone, the action seems bigger and crazier. Explosions roll off the backs of those muscle heads, but John McClane really suffers. That's the trick.",1,1,1,0,0,1,1
Die Hard,"I first saw Die Hard in the late 1980's and have owned it on various formats down the years and will watch it now and again. One of the main reasons I enjoy it so is because of the iconic place it holds within the action genre. At the time it came out we were mostly served up pumped-up action heroes who happily take on entire armies and win in battles that are mostly a simple matter of good versus evil, where good is US and evil is them (whoever them happened to be at that time). Die Hard manages to be more than that by starting out with a ""normal"" guy as our hero. Now I won't pretend that McClane is not an action hero who does extraordinary things but he seems accessible. I particularly like the fact that his first reaction is to run, to call for help form others and that he only faces the terrorists when he has to, rather than going all Rambo on us.If this approach provides a grounding, the concept also brings the action into a slightly more real environment. The action is more or less confined to the tower and the bad guys limited rather than being a constantly flowing army of stuntmen. Director McTiernan uses the location really well, injecting tension and a sense of claustrophobia that works really well. The action is enjoyable and offers a lesson that modern CGI-heavy action movies can learn from  if you rely totally on technology then you'll date quickly, if you make the effects serve the action and narrative then you'll be standing for years. As a result the action in Die Hard feels no less slick or exciting for being almost twenty years old.Although this is the most important part of the film to get right, I always appreciated the clever subtexts in the narrative. Filmed in the 1980's, the film is a clever attack on yuppie values in contrast with the blue-collar ""man's man"" type. In this way the narrative can be viewed as those seeking more and more wealth getting in the way of those who just want to be with their families. The most obvious attack on the business culture is the aligning of the terrorists and the corporation. Hans and Takagi share taste in suits, education, knowledge and even share the same opening lines (""ladies & gentlemen""); it is not a stretch to see the film suggesting that Takagi may have also shared some of Hans' ruthlessness in his rise to the top. This is also evident from the very start  John does not lose his wife to Hans, he has already lost her to the corporation as she drops his name and had moved away. Indeed such is the films paralleling of these two threats to McClane, that he only rescues Holly from Hans by getting the watch off her wrist  the watch that was specifically mentioned at the start of the film as a gift from the company.Ellis sees the connection being made even more obvious as he himself suggests little difference between himself and Hans, apart from the gun and fountain pen aspect. Of course with both businessmen being connected to the terrorists in this way, they must also share their fate, and do. Although it has lumbered the film series with a rather poor catchphrase, the discussion of westerns again confirms the contrast between ""man's man"" and ""new man""  a connection further made by having McClane in his vest, an outfit more befitting a blue collar worker who has his values in the USA frontier rather than the cut-throat world of foreign business. This distain for bureaucracy is also seen in the redemption of Al. Stuck outside the action in the building (handicapped by incompetence) but also desk-bound due to shooting a kid. At the end of the movie he is redeemed by killing Karl in a ""quick-draw"" style shoot out, freeing him from his desk and restoring his manhood. Again the split between bureaucracy and real workers and again the use of wild-west symbolism.The cast respond to the strong script and direction by turning in roundly good performances. Willis has not really been better (even in the same character) and his action twist on his Moonlighting character was the making of him. It is Rickman that dominates the film though; like in Robin Hood, he is a delightful sneering bad guy who has great lines and great presence. The support cast is good below them with Bedelia avoiding being just a damsel in distress; VelJohnson a solid ""buddy""; Godunov is a real physical threat  even if a few of the other terrorists barely make an impression on the memory. Gleason, Atherton, White and Davi all give a good show as well.Rightly an iconic action movie then. The action has stood up really well and is delivered within a story that is tense and well paced. The performances suit the material and, if you want it, there is a clever and engaging subtext running across the whole film. I find it hard to fault and you can see why it has had the influence it has had on the action genre over the last twenty years.",1,1,1,1,0,1,0
Die Hard,"When it comes to action-adventure films of the 1980s. You have Raiders of the Lost Ark standing as a colossus. The ultimate homage to the 1930 'B' serials. Hot on its heels is Die Hard the ultimate action- thriller.Bruce Willis was known for the comedy crime-drama Moonlighting and comedy movies such as Blind Date. He was not someone with bulging muscles like Sylvester Stallone or a former martial arts star or bodybuilder.John McClane the every-man who happens to be a New York cop visiting his estranged wife at her firm's Christmas party, rather partial to Roy Rogers ends up being in the wrong place at the wrong time.Just as the party gets into full swing a bunch of European terrorists take over the office tower block to rob some financial bonds, led by the magnetic and then unknown Alan Rickman (who in those pre Google days, some critics mistook to be some undiscovered German actor readymade to be a Bond villain!)However as the villains hold the rest of the group hostage waiting for their plan to unfurl including getting an assist from the FBI, there is a fly on the ointment. McClane is on the loose and picking off the bad guys one by one.You have a beat cop in contact with McClane, some inept cops, even more inept and gung ho FBI agents, a slimy journalist and a film director on top form giving you one of the best action films of all time.A mixture of thrills, action and humour. Just look at scene when Uli (the oriental bad guy) glances at the chocolate bar during a tense moment and steals it, or Rickman naming some freedom fighter groups which seem to be made up and he states to his fellow henchman that he read about them in Time Magazine.Ultimately Willis pitches his character just right. Here is an actor hungry for that breakout role and he sure hit bulls-eye here even though some of his subsequent actions films have been disappointing.At the other end is Rickman playing the suave, sophisticated and ruthless villain. He brings charisma by the truck load and this was also his launchpad to stardom.",1,1,1,1,0,1,1
Die Hard,"John McClane (Bruce Willis), officer of the NYPD, tries to save wife Holly Gennaro and several others, taken hostage by German terrorist Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) during a Christmas party at the Nakatomi Plaza in Los Angeles.This was the debut of Alan Rickman, the film that cemented Bruce Willis' career as an action star, and possibly the greatest action of film of all time (or at the very least, the 1980s). While it could have become dated, it has not -- not in the slightest.As I write this (December 2013), there is a new ""Red Dawn"" where the Soviets were replaced with North Koreans. The original is now a time capsule. ""Die Hard"" remains timeless because the terrorists were ""European"" and not tied to any particular ideology or movement. This was a wise decision.",1,1,1,1,0,1,0
Die Hard,"This remains one of the modern-day ""classic"" movies that was so popular that is spun several sequels. It was just great entertainment value.The story was ludicrous: one man beating a group of terrorists with outrageous, almost-impossible feats - another ""Rambo"" mentality flick - but it worked. The action scenes are memorable; Bruce Willis is good as the macho hero and David Warner is excellent as the villain.Otherwise, the film is way too profane and too biased, as usual, against law enforcement showing the acting police chief and FBI agents to be arrogant, stupid and crude....just what Liberal Hollywood always does to anyone in authority. But John McTiernan gets away with his profanity-laden bias by directing a film that grabs you early on and never lets you go.....very involving.",1,1,1,1,0,1,0
Die Hard,"About twenty-five years ago it came to light that Elmyr de Hory had been painting fake Rembrandts and Matisses and Monets and whatnot. The fakes were bought by expert collectors and some of them hung in famous galleries. The fakes were so good that they became works of art in themselves, glowing with a technical mastery of the medium, lacking only originality.That's kind of what this movie is like. I don't believe there's an original thought in the whole hour and a half of it, but what is shown on screen is beautifully executed -- direction, script, performances, photography, production design.Everything's derivative. Nothing will surprise you. Even the score is completely ripped off. I mean in its entirety -- Beethoven's Choral Symphony. Nothing could be more obscene than seeing the faces of the murdering thieves light up as the vault door swings open to reveal millions of dollars, while Schiller's Ode to Joy swells up on the score.The whole thing is as shiny and sterile as Nakatomi Plaza, and man that is one repugnant space. Towering blocks of geometrically perfect steel and glass, with three probably real trees in the drivearound, although they would have fit the general tone of the movie if they'd been plastic. The human scale is totally lost. Imagine a supersized Leggo community. Imagine the ants who crawl into those monstrous edifice wrecks every morning, pausing before the entrance, staring up at the steel column disappearing into the clouds, and moaning aloud, ""Oh, my God, not another day of THIS."" Bruce Willis is very good as the New York cop who is the fly in gangleader Alan Rickman's ointment. This is a typical action hero role but Willis brings a comic element to it that, say, Schwarzenegger, Stallone, or Eastwood simply could not. Oh, the others could make wisecracks under stress just as well as Willis, but they couldn't do his hysterically shocked and frightened face when some contretemps comes his way. He looks really scared, his eyeballs practically popping out. Have you ever seen Stallone look scared? No, you haven't. Don't try to kid the kid. Here's how you can tell the difference between the three main heroes of the 1980s action movies. Bruce Willis gets bloody and out of breath. Stallone gets bloody but is never out of breath. Schwarzenegger is never either bloody or breathless. That'll be ten cents.I didn't care too much for Rickman's villain. With that aquiline nose and that mouth full of big white choppers he seemed altogether too slimy. When I first saw this movie, I thought this was the extent of his range. But I was wrong. I've since seen him in half a dozen other varied roles and he has a lot of talent.It's curious to see Hollywood movies flailing about in search of an agreed-upon villain since the collapse of the USSR. I keep wondering whom they'll turn up next. The stock heavies have been Germans (WWII) and Russians (the Cold War). Lately, of course, they've been ""camel jockeys"", to use the current pejorative. ""Die Hard"" opts for the tried and true -- Germans, one of whom has a Russian accent. (Alexander Gudonov, a failed defected ballet dancer, neat guy, who died of drink at an early age.) The action is very well choreographed. Outstanding is the scene in which the roof explodes just as Willis jumps out of a window with a fire hose tied around his waist. He jerks to a stop when the fire hose runs out, smashes through an office window, and the metal roll that contained the hose falls past the broken window and -- well, and so on.There's action, comedy, romance, and all the rest, done to a turn. If you want to be entertained undemandingly for a while, this should do the job.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Die Hard,"One of the original action flicks from the '80s, John McTiernan's ""Die Hard"" makes no pretense about being a kick-ass movie. Bruce Willis plays a New York cop John McClane, coming to LA to meet his estranged wife (Bonnie Bedelia). Sure enough, the building in which she works get hijacked by a group of German terrorists. Terrorist leader Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman in his debut), while totally evil, is also quite cultured. Even though the cards look stacked against John McClane, he's ready to take on every one of these terrorists.Twenty years after its release, this movie will probably only appeal to Willis's fans. While mostly a litany of machismo, there are some cringe-inducing scenes (namely when John has to walk across glass). But the movie's main focus is to show Bruce Willis being a tough guy. They do everything possible to make him a superhuman individual to whom we can still relate.All in all, this is a flick that you'll want to avoid if you're into intellectualism. But you'll love it if you're a testosterone-driven dude. I think that I'm content having seen it only once. Also starring Alexander Godunov (one of the Amish farmers in ""Witness""), Paul Gleason (the principal in ""The Breakfast Club"") and William Atherton (the EPA agent in ""Ghostbusters"").I wouldn't mind getting to ride off into the sunset with Grace Kelly.",1,1,1,1,0,1,1
Die Hard,"From director John McTiernan (Predator) comes the first of the highly popular action thriller films with the star of Moonlighting (in his third film, after two failures). It is Christmas Eve, and John McClane (Bruce Willis) has arrived in Los Angeles to see his wife Holly Gennaro McClane (Bonnie Bedelia) who along with his kids he has not seen for six months. Her promotion is what brought her from New York to LA, and she had to move to work in the Nakatomi Plaza, a 40 story building. She has to do a speech at the party going on, and she leaves the room saying she'll be back, and a few minutes later, a group of German terrorists led by mastermind Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) and his right-hand man Karl (Alexander Godunov) enter the building and take everyone on the 30th floor hostage. John manages to get away and hide in the upper building, still under construction, and the terrorists have no idea he is there. Hans takes Holly's boss Joseph Yashinobo Takagi (James Shigeta) and demands he give him the computer code to open the building's safe to steal $640,000,000 in bearer bonds, and Takagi is killed when he refuses, which John witnesses. Technology expert Theo (Clarence Gilyard Jr.) is told to start working on getting the safe opened, which he thinks will take a couple of hours, John meanwhile is trying to alert the LAPD, because the phone lines have been cut. Once the police are there, they prove incompetent under the command of arrogant deputy chief Dwayne T. Robinson (The Breakfast Club's Paul Gleason), and only Sergeant Al Powell (Reginald VelJohnson) on the walkie talkie supports him, so John has to save the hostages alone. There is one part where John meets Hans face to face, but he believes for a tiny while he is a hostage, because he puts on an American accent. Eventually, John manages to help the hostages, stop the robbery, and confront Hans who is holding his wife#s bracelet, but he does fall to his death eventually. Also starring De'Voreaux White as Argyle, William Atherton as Richard Thornburg, Hart Bochner as Harry Ellis, The Living Daylights' Andreas Wisniewski as Tony, Licence to Kill's Robert Davi as Agent Johnson and Grand L. Bush as Agent Johnson. Filled with fantastic action and stunts (some done by Willis himself), great acting, a humorous, wise cracking and admirable hero in the wrong place at the wrong time, a cunning villain, and the great catchphrase, ""Yippee-ki-yay, mother f***er"", this is an essential action thriller. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Sound Effects Editing, Best Visual Effects, Best Film Editing and Best Sound. Bruce Willis was number 35 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Hans Gruber was number 46 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes & Villains, and the film was number 39 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills. Outstanding!",1,1,1,1,1,1,1
Die Hard,"Totally outrageous, totally unbelievable and totally over the top - and as Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) would say - 'But who cares'? It's Bruce Willis in a version of saving humanity along the lines of John Wayne, Rambo and Marshal Dillon. Personally, John McClane had me when he said he was partial to Roy Rogers because that's who my favorite TV and movie cowboy was as a kid growing up. I'd bet that someone might say that of Willis some day.In his own way, John McClane must have had some sort of mystical power because up until the point he started crawling through the transom feeling like a TV dinner, his wife-beater t-shirt was white with some blood spatter. But when he hit the floor again to do battle with the bad guys it suddenly turned brown. So mesmerized was I by this turn of events that I never even noticed when the shirt turned a neat dark forest green later in the picture. I wonder how stuff like that gets by the director? Say, and how about the FBI sending in a double Johnson to take over the attack at Nakatomi Plaza? I'm sure there's a pretty good punch line in there somewhere but I think I'll just let it go for now.It's been stated, and rightly so I think, that this film set a new standard for action/adventure flicks with Bruce Willis portraying a new kind of hero. He's smart, thinks on his feet, takes what help he can get, and engages in wise-ass banter to keep the audience fully engaged. All the noise, explosions and crashing glass is merely window dressing to keep the story moving as our hero saves the day. What more can you ask for in a two hour action flick? You know, if this was a Roy Rogers Western it would probably have a title like ""Under California Stars"". If I had to guess, I'd say Bruce Willis saw that one when he was a kid.",1,1,1,1,1,1,0
Die Hard,"When New York detective John McClane goes to Los Angeles to visit his wife who works for a large Japanese company he is expecting a fairly quiet time he certainly doesn't expect the party celebrating the opening of the company's brand new skyscraper to be gate-crashed by a dozen or more heavily armed terrorists lead by a German called Hans Gruber! Luckily when they strike he is away from the party in his wife's office so he is able to lead a one man fight back. Once he has managed to kill one of the terrorists he can use his radio to try to contact the local police although they don't seem to believe him until a body comes crashing through the windscreen of Sgt. Al Powell's squad car! He becomes McClane's contact as the situation intensifies as first the LAPD then the FBI attempt to deal with Hans and his gang. It is soon clear that Hans has anticipated the responses of everybody except McClane so it is up to him to thwart their plans.The eighties were a decade packed with great action movies; a decade where action meant fights, bullets and plenty of explosions all accompanied by a few witty one-liners rather than excessive CGI and this is one of the best examples of an '80s action film. Bruce Willis was on top form as John McClane and Alan Rickman was delightfully over the top as Hans Gruber, Reginald VelJohnson also does a decent job as Sgt. Powell. As well as the almost non-stop action there some laughs to be had although they never feel forced. If you like '80s action films then you really need to watch this and if you've seen it already; watch it again!",1,1,1,1,0,1,1
Die Hard,"The first time I ever saw Die Hard it was at the Film On The Square screening, part of the London Film Festival in Leicester Square, November 1988; I spent the following weeks—up until the film's official UK release date on February 3rd—trying to convince people that Bruce Willis would be the next big Hollywood action star and that Die Hard would change the face of the action genre forever. 'Bruce Willis from Moonlighting?' they would say, 'I don't think so.' 'Just wait and see', I would reply...A quarter of a century later and Bruce is still proving me right (the fifth Die Hard movie came out earlier this year and Red 2 is on general release as I type); but no matter how long the guy keeps on blowing stuff up and shooting bad guys on screen, I doubt he will ever match the brilliance of Die Hard, which remains the pinnacle of action cinema as far as I am concerned, a film where everything came together to create pure cinematic gold.Director John McTiernan at the top of his game, fresh from the success of Schwarzenegger vehicle Predator; perfect casting throughout, from Alan Rickman's loathsome lead villain Hans Gruber and Bonnie Bedelia's plucky Holly McClean, right down to Al Leong as mustachioed henchman Uli and Playboy Playmate Terri Lynn Doss as the blonde hottie at the airport; a great soundtrack that combines hip-hop and classical music with a seasonal flavour; visual effects from Richard Edlund that still hold up well against any of today's CGI; superb cinematography courtesy of Jan De Bont; a brilliant script with cracking dialogue and a wry sense of humour (that scene with the SWAT member catching himself on a rose bush still cracks me up!): Die Hard is virtually flawless in every department.Unless you've been in a coma or living in a cave for the past two and a half decades, you'll no doubt be familiar with the plot, so I won't waste any time summarising what happens, suffice to say that the set-up is lean, mean and full of explosive, edge-of-the-seat action, and is still influencing action film-makers today, recent examples being comic-book sci-fi flick Dredd and martial arts actioner The Raid. But no matter how many derivatives (or sequels) it spawns, the original will always be the best—a white knuckle ride of a movie with the power to thrill your socks off even after all of these years (so watch out for broken glass!).",1,1,1,1,0,1,1
White Christmas,"""White Christmas"" is a pleasant but quite formulaic musical--a decent time-passer but not a lot more. However, rather inexplicably, the film turned out to be the #1 box office champ of the year--something I just don't understand when I see it today.The film begins during WWII. Bing Crosby and Danny Kaye play soldiers who are entertaining the troops during Christmas. Soon, the war is over and the two go on to Broadway and become a huge musical team--absolutely huge. The problem is that Kaye is dissatisfied, as they are always working---and his partner is always thinking of business. So, he comes up with a plan--get Bing married and then they'll have to take it easier! And, when the duo meet two musical sisters (Vera-Ellen and Rosemary Clooney), Danny and Vera just decide that Bing MUST marry Rosemary---just like that! Not surprisingly, there are MANY bumps and misunderstandings along the way--as, after all, it IS a very formulaic relationship. What is not exactly formula, however, is the parallel plot involving Danny and Bing's old commander--the General. The General is running a hotel in Vermont--but it's failing due to unusually hot weather. So, the four decide to get together and perform a show--just the sort of thing Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland would have done a decade and a half earlier.The film has a lot of pluses and minuses. As I mentioned above, the film is easy to predict due to its strong use of traditional film formulas. However, the actors did a nice job with what they had. My biggest complaint about the film were all the song and dance numbers. There were just too many and many were quite forgettable. Several could have been cut and more emphasis should have been on plot--but, considering how successful the film was, what do I know? I just know that today the film is a bit sluggish because of this. You cannot trim the title song, but a bit of trimming would have tightened up the film and kept a better pace. Overall, it's uneven but enjoyable.",1,1,1,0,1,1,1
White Christmas,"I can not believe that I did not see this movie before now. Maybe when I was 8, when White Christmas was on every year, I wasn't as into musicals as I am now, save movies like Annie, Wizard of Oz and Oliver! I am truly sorry, for this was an excellent film, that is perfect for the Christmas holiday season. White Christmas looks lovely, shot in beautiful Vista Vision with nice cinematography and wonderful costumes. The red dresses in the reprise of White Christmas especially were to die for. The songs and score by Irving Berlin is outstanding; the title song White Christmas is not only one of my all time favourite Christmas songs but also one of my favourite songs ever in a musical. But the other songs go without fault too, particularly The Best Things Happen When You're Dancing and Sisters.The script and story, serving as a partial remake of Holiday Inn, are top notch, if a little fluffy and implausible in places. Even better were the performances, with Bing Crosby his usual charming self as Bob, and while weak at the start Danny Kaye is superb as Phil. His dance routine with Vera Ellen, who looked gorgeous here and sang and danced a dream, was a knockout. Rosemary Clooney is positively riveting as Betty as well, in a suitably calm and subdued performance. I have to say I loved the choreography, it was clever, fast-paced and energetic. Overall, it may be fluff and a tad schmaltzy, but it is an excellent and timeless holiday movie. 10/10 Bethany Cox",1,1,1,1,1,1,1
White Christmas,"By 1954 the song White Christmas had become such a timeless classic that it was inevitable that a film would be made around it. And of course the star would be none other than Bing Crosby. But who to star with him.Originally this was to be the third Irving Berlin outing for Bing and Fred Astaire. Then Donald O'Connor was to co-star, but finally Danny Kaye teamed with Der Bingle. Proved to be a felicitous combination.By then Rosemary Clooney had worked in a few films well and more importantly, she had clicked with Crosby on the radio. Bing had teamed with several girl singers over the years, like Connee Boswell, Frances Langford, Mary Martin, Trudy Erwin, Carole Richards, Peggy Lee and a trio of sisters named Andrews. But he always said Rosemary Clooney was it for him and besides Mary Martin, the only other one who did became a leading lady for him.It's not remembered because of the success of her solo career, but Rosemary Clooney started as a duo with her sister Betty who retired early to raise a family. So with Vera-Ellen as her sister in the movie, that was an aspect of the plot Rosemary could handle with ease.The plot such as it is involves Bing and Danny as a song and dance duo who've expanded into the production end of show business. Through a little bit of a con game worked by Vera Ellen, the two meet a singing sister act like the Clooney sisters were. The sisters turn out to be headed to Vermont to work at a resort and the smitten guys go along with them.Problem is there ain't any snow there. It's an unheard of 68 degrees Fahrenheit in early December. And the place is owned by Crosby and Kaye's former commander from World War II, played by Dean Jagger. He's about to lose his shirt and his pride. So our intrepid quartet go to work.Irving Berlin's score for White Christmas is about half new songs and the other half from previous scores. That's how it was when you got Irving to work for you. Listen carefully even to the background music. You will not hear one note of a non-Berlin song. One of those songs was a personal favorite of mine, Count Your Blessings Instead of Sheep. I recall in grade school in Brooklyn it was a song that the teachers had us sing in the school assemblies. Little did I know that it was introduced by the guy who proved to be my favorite entertainer. It's a patented philosophical Bing Crosby song that he did best and it serves as a ballad to woo and win Rosie. Bing sings it and then Rosie joins him in the reprise.Danny Kaye has two good numbers. The first The Best Things Happen While Your Dancing is clearly originally for Fred Astaire, though Kaye and Vera Ellen make a lovely couple on the dance floor. The Choreography number I think was also done for Astaire, but here dancer John Brascia does the complicated dance routine while Kaye sings. I'm sure Astaire would have handled both jobs had the film been made with him.All the stars do the Minstrel Show/Mandy number, but Vera Ellen really shines in it. She was a great dancer, really sparkled in every film she did.Besides Sisters, Rosemary Clooney has a grand torch ballad that sold a few platters for her in Love, You Didn't Do Right By Me. She had a wonderful singing voice and the most impeccable diction of any female singer ever. You don't miss one throbbing word on any of her ballads.White Christmas was Paramount's first film done in their wide screen process called VistaVision. And of course it was proper that their number one star for over 20 years be in this film. Of course jokes about Bing's derrière and the wide screen got into the repertoire of a certain comedian named Hope.Just like the song that inspired it, White Christmas has proved to be a timeless holiday classic and will remain so.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1

They decide to try and bring some new business to the place and they also add a sister act (Rosemary Clooney, Vera-Ellen) to the lineup, which soon leads to romance. By the time this film was released Crosby's song 'White Christmas' was already a legendary classic so I guess it should come as no surprise that someone would try and wrap an entire film around it. I know this film is loved by thousands of people across the world but I wasn't all that impressed with it. For starters, this semi-remake of HOLIDAY INN doesn't hold a candle to anything in that movie. Every single item in the earlier film is much better than anything here so director Michael Curtiz isn't able to match anything. That wouldn't have been a problem had more simply been done here. There's no question that there are some good dance sequences as all four stars really give it their all. I think it would be fair to say that Kaye and Very-Ellen steal the film with their various dance scenes, which are clearly the highlight. There's also no denying that both Crosby and Clooney sound terrific together and they also have a nice spark that works in the romantic scenes. The biggest problem with the film is its screenplay, which is just one cliché after another and it just never sparks to life. It also doesn't help that the majority of the Irving Berlin songs just seem like a poor imitation of something he would write. WHITE Christmas is loved by many and disliked by many so ones mileage is going to vary in regards to how they take the film. I will add that the film, the first shown in VistaVision, at least looks great but you just wish there was a tad bit more meat on the bone.",-1,0,0,-1,0,0,-1
White Christmas,"White Christmas is a solid family musical with one ultra-famous Christmas song sung early on in the proceedings. For the rest of the running time it's a rather typical Hollywood musical of its era: warm, good-natured, with lots of well-choreographed dance and singing routines, and a feel-good storyline. It's not my favourite of its type - I'm a sucker for Gene Kelly - but as a Christmas musical, it shines.Bing Crosby is the obvious draw here as the film belongs to him throughout, but the supporting cast are effective too. Danny Kaye has a fairly difficult role I reckon, playing second-string to Crosby, but he comes off as amiable enough. Rosemary Clooney and Vera Ellen are fine as the singing sisters. Like many of its type, White Christmas flags a little in between the songs, but the musical numbers are well staged and likable, so there's little to complain about overall.",1,1,1,0,1,0,1
White Christmas,"Army buddies Bob Wallace (Bing Crosby) and Phil Davis (Danny Kaye) become a successful song and dance team after the war.

They become fast friends with the girls and travel to Vermont for a Christmas show. They find a failing lodge run by their former commander, and decide to save it with a grand show.As a rom-com, it's strictly vanilla flavor. There isn't much heat, and there aren't any surprises. This is really only interesting for the song and dance. And there are some great songs. It's not just the iconic title song, but there are a whole bunch of others also written by Irving Berlin. And that's the real star of this movie. It's a showcase for Irvin Berlin's talents.",1,1,1,0,1,0,1
White Christmas,"I know that people may think me unpatriotic, but the message here is that we need to continue to glorify war. The U.S. had just finished World War II and celebrated a great victory. Now we had the big Commie fear and a trip to Korea where many more of our young people dead. So in 1954 comes a ""Christmas"" movie. It pushes all the right buttons and has the stars of the day, Danny Kaye, Rosemary Clooney, and Bing Crosby (one of the most hawkish performers of all time) and becomes a kind of recruiting poster when we were done with war for a while (of course, we were already meddling in southeast Asia). It does have a decent story and those songs were well performed, but there is no comparison between this and ""Holiiday Inn"" which carries a much more romantic theme, and also stars Bing Crosby. The main thing for me is that at times I just find it sort of dull.",0,1,0,0,0,1,1
White Christmas,"While this film certainly has a cult following, it really can't be counted as 100 percent a Christmas movie. Basically a remake of 1942's ""Holiday Inn"" where the title song from this movie was introduced (and deservedly won an Oscar), it adds color, camp, and Danny Kaye to the familiar story. Danny takes over in the role Fred Astaire played in ""Holiday Inn"", and his character adds comedy into the mix, some funny, some cloying. Technicolor loves Rosemary Clooney and Vera-Ellen, and they wear all sorts of gorgeous gowns. Unfortunately, this mixture of pastiche and Technicolor ends up being an extremely mixed bag that brings huge smiles in some scenes, rolled eyes in others.The campiest moment comes with the duet of ""Sisters"", first seen with Vera-Ellen and Clooney, and later repeated by the mincing Crosby and Kaye. The later version was apparently done as a gag and kept in the film. A big production number saluting the old minstrel shows features the tackiest of jokes and the ugliest of costumes. It worked great in ""Kid Millions"" in 1934, but in the post war world of 1954, it is a major groaner of a number. Even duller is Kaye's ""Choreography"", as pretentious as it sounds. He does get a nice duet with Vera-Ellen, ""The Best Things Happen When You're Dancing"", while Crosby and Clooney get to sing the beautiful ""Count Your Blessings Instead of Sheep"". Clooney gets a good solo moment with ""Love, You Didn't Do Right By Me"", a mediocre song which becomes better simply because of how she sells it.As for the Christmas sequences, they open and end the film, hence the reason for the title. Dean Jagger plays the retiring General who moves to the aforementioned ""Holiday Inn"" after the end of World War II, and is given a rousing send-off. Mary Wickes shines as his housekeeper, but then again, doesn't she always shine no matter what film she's in? The two major Christmas songs are the title song, first repeated by Crosby (who introduced it in ""Holiday Inn"") and later utilized for the lavish finale where the hotel walls open up like a Broadway set. I guess you're supposed to really feel the Christmas spirit when this happens, but had the whole story surrounded the holidays rather than just the opening and conclusion, I would have been much happier. A minor little number, ""Snow"", celebrates the season nicely, but its not one of Berlin's better songs. Michael Curtiz seems an odd choice for director of a big, elephantine musical. This was a busy time for Irving Berlin as he just had another catalog of his songs done on screen (the much better ""There's No Business Like Show Business"") and the previous year's ""Call Me Madam"", both with Ethel Merman. So while he may have been considered, as Jerome Kern called him, ""American Music"", he was represented elsewhere. This musical certainly has its fans, and while I applaud much of what is in here, I have to consider this one a missed opportunity, much like Crosby's next remake of an old film of his, ""Anything Goes"", where the same studio forgot that it was based on an old Cole Porter hit, and equally as disengaging.",1,1,1,0,1,1,1
White Christmas,"A successful song-and-dance team (Bing Crosby and Danny Kaye) become romantically involved with a sister act (Rosemary Clooney and someone else) and team up to save the failing Vermont inn of their former commanding general (Dean Jagger).This is pretty decent film. Despite not having almost anything to do with Christmas, and having two of the ugliest women as female leads (one of whom is beyond anorexica dn the other who was born as a man), and having the relatively unknown Danny Kaye overshadow Bing Crosby... it has enough good moments to carry itself. Kaye is really the reason to watch the film. He is the better dancer, possibly the better singer. The ""Theater"" skit is excellent. I could have done without hearing the ""Sisters"" song so many times (though seeing the men perform it was a nice touch -- even if it is not explained how they had the female voices -- were the ladies lip-syncing all those times?).This probably sums up the film, more or less. While it is quite good as a romance or musical, it is not a strong Christmas film. The story could have taken place at any time and it would hardly have mattered. And, as I understand it, this was the third film that Crosby sings ""White Christmas"" in -- so why is this one deserving of the title and not the other two? Hmm.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1
White Christmas,"If you've read any of my reviews of musicals, then you'll know that not only are they possibly my least favorite kind of movie, but that I watch them mainly to heckle them a la ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"". Among my rude comments this time were: ""You don't think I'm repulsive, do you?"" - Not next to Bob Dole you aren't.(while the old woman is handing out glasses of champagne) ""Champagne?"" - Yes it is.(at the train station) ""Betty left this for you."" - Dear Judy, an alligator bit off my head.As for the sign telling people not to leave cigarette butts and ashes lying around, you just have to blur the scene a little bit to make it say ""butts and asses"". That's an immature thing to do, you say? Well, ""White Christmas"" is a pretty immature movie.As for that comment about Stephen Colbert. When a remake of the horror classic ""Black Christmas"" (considered by many people to be the very first slasher) got released a few years ago, he asserted that it ripped off this movie. In his right-wing commentator persona, he declared something like, if anyone's going to get chased by a psycho killer, it should be Rosemary Clooney. I wonder, would it have swayed his opinion either way to remind him that Rosemary Clooney's nephew stars in movies like ""Syriana""? I should say, however, that George Clooney had a fine-looking aunt.What I mean - as a joke, natch - about carousels taking over is this. A few days ago, I saw the 1956 version of Rodgers and Hammerstein's ""Carousel"" (which I heckled). The next day, I saw ""Carosello napoletano"" (""Neapolitan Carousel"" in English, it was one of Sophia Loren's early movies). Finally, this movie contains numerous references to carousels. Next might there be a movie in which carousels come to life and go all Freddy Krueger on everyone? Yes, I admit that this review barely makes any sense. I just like to do this when reviewing these kinds of movies. I don't like Bing Crosby one bit, while I consider Danny Kaye a genius. But a really cool Christmas movie that I recently saw is ""Silent Night, Deadly Night""; an appropriate one with Halloween approaching. I also recommend the original ""Black Christmas"".",0,1,1,0,1,1,1
White Christmas,"Bing Crosby's most well-loved and Oscar winning Christmas song came from the film Holiday Inn, it became so popular, director Michael Curtiz (Casablanca, Mildred Pierce) was given the job to make a whole film out of it. Basically, in World War II, after leaving the army, Bob Wallace (Crosby) and Phil Davis (Danny Kaye) team up to become successful song and dance stage act, and also manage to get into Broadway as producers. In a night club, Bob is introduced to the Haynes sisters, Betty Haynes (Rosemary Clooney, George's aunt) and Judy (Vera-Ellen) who also sing and dance on stage, who end up following them all the way to a small Vermont lodge. Bob and Phil are really surprised to see their old commanding officer, Major General Thomas F. Waverly (Dean Jagger) as owner of the lodge, but he isn't having much luck with business. They come up with a plan to save his business with a song and dance act they created for Broadway, but brought to the small lodge instead. Obviously things don't go smoothly, there is a rift forming between Bob and Betty, even when they were originally smitten, and happy Phil and Judy try to get them back together. Eventually the whole show is brought together for a big surprise for Waverly as all his soldiers come to the show, and they sing and dance their Christmassy show with the snow falling outside. Also starring Mary Wickes as Emma Allen, John Brascia as John, Anne Whitfield as Susan Waverly and Sig Ruman as Landlord. Some of the dance sequences are fun to watch, and songs like ""The Best Things Happen When You're Dancing"" and ""Geee! I Wish I Was Back in the Army"" are catchy, and the performances are alright. It wasn't a bad film in any way, I did enjoy myself, and I can see why it would be given four stars, but the best part is indeed Crosby's treasured song, for that I would probably watch it again. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Song for ""Count Your Blessings Instead of Sheep"". It was number 37 on The 100 Greatest Musicals, and it was number 17 on The 100 Greatest Christmas Moments. Very good!",1,1,1,1,1,1,1
White Christmas,"Often, repeat viewings of a movie will reward me with a greater appreciation for it, however in the case of ""White Christmas"", the effect may be the opposite, so I might better 'count my blessings' and stop with today's screening. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for nostalgia, but this one appears to have aged rather poorly, perhaps for no other reason than the passage of time and changing tastes.Probably the thing that works against the film the most is the choice of songs that have nothing to do with Christmas or the holiday season. Yes, there's the title song and repeated lines from 'Snow', but what's up with the 'Mandy' dance number and the 'Choreography' routine. Rosemary Clooney's Carousel Club song, ""Love, You Done Me Wrong"" seemed particularly troubling, even though it momentarily fit her situation with the Bingster. Also, another poster on this board had it right about ""What Can You Do With A General"" - I actually picked up the video sleeve to remind me what I was watching.Apart from the actual story, there's no reason not to admire the talent on display by the principals. To my mind, there's no finer singing voice than Bing Crosby's. Danny Kaye is spirited as Bing's partner, but he does tap that arm a bit much in the later going. Clooney's charm manages to come through her reserved character, but the showstopper if there is one would be Vera-Ellen in that 'Mandy' routine, watching leaves one almost as breathless as she should have been while doing it.Except for the title and the packaging, ""White Christmas"" has no claim on the truly great holiday films like ""It's A Wonderful Life"" or the Alastair Sim ""A Christmas Carol"". The only thing I would like to know is if Emma (Mary Wickes) ever did resign from 'Busybody's Anonymous'.",0,1,0,-999,-1,1,-999
White Christmas,"A would-be successor to 1942's ""Holiday Inn"", this film begins and ends with ""Holiday""'s Oscar-winning song ""White Christmas"" but otherwise doesn't have much of a seasonal theme. A song-and-dance team, best friends since their Army days, partner themselves with a tuneful and attractive sister act; together, the frolicsome foursome save a dwindling Vermont inn owned by the boys' favorite General (whom they still salute!). Bing Crosby (with his hand on his hip) looks awfully wooden or unsure of himself here, though he works rather amiably with the looser Danny Kaye. Still, there are no romantic sparks between Crosby and Rosemary Clooney, nor Kaye and Vera-Ellen, which causes the love story half of the picture to be left wanting. The colorful production (though a bit elephantine) is lustrous and glossy, and a few of the musical numbers are fun, yet there isn't enough plot on hand to cover two hours on the clock. The final military celebration seems unnecessarily overblown, but the film's technical aspects and choreography are marvelous. ** from ****",0,1,1,0,1,1,1
White Christmas,"To celebrate Christmas and to pay respects to Mr. Bing Crosby who died a little more than 30 years ago, I decided to watch for the first time in its entirety, White Christmas. This movie made of Irving Berlin songs both old and new, also stars Danny Kaye, Vera-Ellen, Rosemary Clooney, Dean Jagger, and Mary Wickes with some familiar bit players like Herb Vigran and Grady Sutton. Also, George Chakiris, best known as Bernardo in West Side Story, is a dancing extra here. The story of two former army buddies-turned-musical-partners who meet a two sister singing act that's on their way to a lodge owned by the general of the former army pals is just a contrivance to put together various songs to fit in certain segments. Good musical performances abound with some of my favorites being ""Choreography"" with Kaye and Vera-Ellen making fun of Jazz-Ballet and the ""Count Your Blessings"" duet with Crosby and Clooney. While I said the story is pretty contrived, I also was mostly willing to go along with most of it as the performers made it all go down easy with director Michael Curtiz lending a brisk pace throughout. The now-classic song ""White Christmas"" was probably better handled in Holiday Inn by Bing some 12 years before but still, it's a good way to both begin and end this wonderful showcase to Mr. Berlin that's become a holiday classic for the last 50 years. P.S.-The picture that Vera-Ellen show of she and Clooney's brother that served with Bing and Danny is that of former Our Ganger/Little Rascal Carl ""Alfalfa"" Switzer!",1,1,1,1,1,1,1
White Christmas,"Legendary Michael Curtiz directs this showcase of talent in an attempt to capitalize on the song ""White Christmas"" that first appeared in the 1942 classic HOLIDAY INN. Quite innocent and evocative of the early 50's mindset. One of those let's save the day by putting on a show. A song and dance team will help keep their former commanding officer's(Dean Jagger)Vermont inn alive. A real talented cast that includes Bing Crosby, Danny Kaye, Rosemary Clooney, Vera-Ellen, John Brascia and Anne Whitefield. How can you have Bing Crosby and not hear his ""White Christmas""? Other memorable tunes: ""The Best Things Happen When You're Dancing"", ""Count Your Blessing Instead of Sheep"" and ""Snow"".Note: Curtiz four years later would direct Jagger in the Elvis Presley classic KING CREOLE.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1
Ma Rainey's Black Bottom,"I never read the source this was based on. But Denzel Washington (who already used the writer for another movie he made, that he and Viola starred in, she's back in front of the camera, he's ""just"" producing) takes it upon himself to make the works known to a new audience. Some of whom may not be inclined to read (not judging either way).We get treated to some wonderful performances - especially the late, sorely missed and way too soon taken away from us Chadwick Boseman. There is Buzz about him get at least an Oscar nomination, possibly even a win. Something he is most deserving of and he has proven not just in this movie. As light and fun as he was in interviews, as intense and craftful he is in front of the camera. I said it when I watched the James Brown movie (get on up) he made - that performance was more than worthy of any acting award on this planet! Will he win for this, which is more of an assemble piece? We will see if he gets this recognition even if way too late for my liking.But back to this and a dark chapter. This is not happy go lucky, this is and depicts racism in many forms. And how some artists back then tried to fight back. Not that they were without flaws (Viola or rather the character she portrays has her own demons to fight with) - clashing here are too hot heads with a past and a present. Both stirred up by other factors, unable to lash out at those factors (mostly drawn and set up by white folk), unleash on each other.Not something that is fun to watch when it happens, but early on we can see how deep the wounds of Chadwicks character are ... literally and figuratively speaking. The amount of work he again put into this - but we had that already and this shall not take anything away from the others involved here ... their commitment and their acting is matching his ... they had to I guess.From that standpoint this is superb filmmaking .. the pacing and the tone might not bode well with some though ... but this is not here to make friends. It is not here to be light entertainment ... it is here to remind everyone, what our past had in store for us, so we won't make the same mistakes again ... hopefully. We are people and none of us is superior to others because of the color of our skin (to be clear, I am talking about racism which obviously was done mainly by white people ... and unfortunately under the still residing POTUS is running wild again) ...",1,1,1,1,1,1,0
Ma Rainey's Black Bottom,"I was thinking at first - please note at first for like the first ten to twenty minutes - with Chadwick Boseman's performance at Levee, ""yeah, this is good, actually perceptive when it comes to an artist's bragodoccio and sense of self when they know they got the goods at what they do - but I didn't necessarily think that it was a truly great performance (if anything I was still preferring his James Brown as far as giants of Black music). He was doing justice for Wilson'd words if not going above and beyond. And then...There came that monologue about a third of the way in about taking it or saying yes or no to and from white people, where Levee came from, and it transcended the space and time of where he was. He even went past the solid if basic close-up that director George chose for the majority of this moment and pierces your soul. Practically every Black person in America has that right at their door with white people - and how Boseman superlatively channels Levee's pain and resolve and how he's maybe or maybe not come to terms with that (and this also sets up his ferocious and usually righteous anger throughout) is Exhibit A as to why he was so special as an actor. I look forward to the likely event of him becoming one of the small handful of performers to receive an Oscar posthumously.Oh, and Viola Davis is pretty damn good too, in a role that very easily can call for eating everything on set for lunch, but she manages to bring it down to this being a human being with a sense of why she is who she is in the world. Domingo (who was superb in Beale Street) and Turman are excellent in supporting roles. 8.5/10",1,1,1,0,0,1,1
Ma Rainey's Black Bottom,"The late August Wilson is celebrated for his 'Philadelphia' cycle of ten plays all but one of which are set in his home town, the city of brotherly love. The exception is this one, which was the first in the cycle and is set in Chicago where four black musicians are waiting for the legendary blues singer Ma Rainey who is late for her date to cut two sides - the time is 1927 when discs were made of shellac. All of Wilson's work explores the 'black' experience and this is no exception and trumpet player Chadwick Boseman (in what turned out to be his final film) loses no time needling the other three and the 'N' word is flung about liberally. Although Viola Davis has the eponymous role it is Boseman who has the lion's share of the dialogue yet at the end of the day it remains a powerful piece of ensemble acting.",1,1,1,0,0,1,0
Ma Rainey's Black Bottom,"Greetings again from the darkness. As an Executive Producer, Denzel Washington has pledged to bring 10 August Wilson plays (collectively known as 'The Pittsburgh Cycle' or 'Century Cycle') to cinema. The first was the Oscar-nominated FENCES (2016), and George C Wolf directs this, the second. Ruben Santiago-Hudson has adapted Wilson's 1984 play into a feature film vehicle for some of the finest on screen acting we will see this year.Viola Davis (Oscar winner, FENCES) stars as Gertrude ""Ma"" Rainey, the ""Mother of Blues"", and the recently deceased Chadwick Boseman co-stars as Levee, her ambitious trumpet player. Ms. Davis delivers a towering performance, and Mr. Boseman leaves us with his career best. The film opens in 1927 rural Georgia with two African-Americans running through the woods under the cover of darkness. If your mind goes where my mind did, we are both wrong. They are headed to a shack acting as a nightclub, and we get our first look and listen at Ma belting out a tune. It's a powerful image and one that expertly sets the tone.Soon we are in Chicago as Ma's band makes their way to a recording studio. Cutler (Colman Santiago, IF BEALE STREET COULD TALK, 2018) plays the trombone and is the de facto leader, Toledo (Glynn Turman, ""Fargo"") is the piano player, and Slow Drag (Michael Potts) plays the bass. The three older men all arrive on time at the studio and are waiting on trumpet player Levee (Boseman) and Ma. When Levee does show up, he struts into the rehearsal room and flashes his new shoes. The generational difference is immediate evident, and the fiery banter is superb. Levee is charming and cocky, while the older men are wise from experience and have undoubtedly seen dozens of Levees throughout their years. Cutler's strong religious beliefs become known and Toledo's sage advice falls on deaf ears.Ma literally crashes into the scene, and we quickly understand that this woman will apologize for nothing, and has earned the right to call her own shots - even if that's only true in this one corner of the universe. She understand the power her record sales give her, and she seizes every possible upper hand - whether it's which arrangement to sing on a song, allowing her stuttering nephew to record, or even demanding a cold coca-cola before singing. Ma speaks in third person and her attitude is not that of a warm, grateful person, but rather of a woman who understands what she has earned. When she says, ""All they want is my voice"", we know exactly what she means.More collisions occur, this time figuratively. There is a collision of swagger between Ma and Levee. The collision of generations with Levee and the band. Finally, there is the collision of Levee and the white man. Ma wants to sing her songs on the record the way she sings them for her fans, while Levee is pushing for the ""new"" up-tempo sound. Levee's ambition for songwriting and putting together his own band clashes with the older musicians who are satisfied to be working, and Levee tries to play the game by playing up to the white men in power, only to be taught the lesson that his bandmates tried to warn him of.Wilson is known for his speeches, and the key players get their moment. Toledo describes blacks as ""the leftovers"", while Ma describes white people listening to the blues ... ""They hear it come out, but they don't know how it got there."" These are powerful moments, yet standing above them are the two soliloquies we hear from Levee. The first is about his background of family and introduction to white men, while the second is truly an other-worldly cinematic moment - he contests the unwavering religious beliefs in what ultimately proves to be the most tragic way. It's a scene which will be Mr. Boseman's long-lasting acting legacy.Supporting work is provided by Jeremy Shamos as Ma's agent Irvin, Taylour Paige as another line in the sand between Ma and Levee, Dusan Brown as Ma's nephew, and Jonny Coyne as the studio owner/producer. This is not so much a story, but rather inspiration for us to assemble the various pieces into the backstories of these characters. It's a way for us to better understand what they did to get here, and how they are handling it now. Step on the shoes at your own peril. When someone overcomes so much in life, they aren't likely to back down gently. The music is terrific, the message is strong, and the performances are unforgettable.

Ma Rainey's Black Bottom,"""Blues help you get out of bed in the morning."" Ma Rainey (Viola Davis)Ma Rainey looks like she would get up on the wrong side of that bed, but she sure can sing the blues on either side. In Netflix's Ma Rainey's Black Bottom, Davis plays another survivor, this one the opposite of her submissive wife to Denzel's domineering husband in August Wilson's Fences (1985 play).Washington produces this 1982 Wilson play, and he casts another strong Black actor, Chadwick Bozeman, to play Ma's feisty young horn player. Because Levee wants arrangements of their blues to be fleet with the spirit and pace of jazz, he gets the white promoters to back him, to little avail because Ma wants it her old way. Negotiating with the charismatic Ma or even playing music doesn't happen until she gets her ""ice-old"" Coca Cola. Old school prevails even if Levee is right.The natural tension between stasis and progress allows Bozeman to act half-crazed and inspired, a tour de force performance fitting for his last one before his death. Amazing is his acting range from a cool leader in Black Panther to a hothead in this drama. He has a minimum of two extended speeches, one almost five minutes about a disturbing crime he witnessed and his father's revenge on the perpetrators. I challenge you to go to the fridge during these impassioned pleas for justice.It's not difficult to see Levee carrying on the angry legacy of his father in a world on the brink of massive racism as Blacks migrate to the North and its entrenched resistance. Ma's players are constantly negotiating for payment from the white business manager and recording studio owner, both of whom are capitalists, not humanists.As in Wilson's Fences, the action takes place in only two spaces, here in a recording studio and in a basement practice room for a 1927 Chicago recording session. A brief foray onto the street brings more conflict, as if there weren't enough inside.Ma Rainey's Black Bottom is made for stage or film because the dialogue is electric and human. Sometimes the vernacular and rapid pace are challenging to understand; well, then, just rewind or use closed caption: ""They hear it (blues) come out, but they don't know how it got there. They don't understand that that's life's way of talking."" (Ma)Ma says it all about black/white conflict and the tensions of artistic creativity: ""They gonna treat me the way I want to be treated no matter how much it hurt 'em."" It's tough out there, 1927 or 2020.",1,1,0,1,0,1,1
Ma Rainey's Black Bottom,"""Sporting Ma's oleaginous, smudgy war paint and flamboyant outfit, Davis goes for broke in the prima donna default (her singing is dubbed, right?), Ma can't suffer gladly anyone who doesn't bend to her biddings, neither the subservient manager Irvin (Shamos), the dour-looking producer Sturdyvant (Coyne), nor those who have the same pigmentation like hers. Being a colored woman who make good in the societal echelon, she has the clout to be nobody's doormat, her pride festering into conceit and her pertinacious insistence of equal respect making her egocentric (giving white lickspittles a taste of their own medicine, she can also stand pat with nepotism). It is interesting that there is no love lost between Ma and Levee, under any mitigated circumstances, the pair could have hit it off and put their talents together into greater use. Yet, can't we not relate to Ma? Anyone in her position will be none the wiser, her bluntness and high-handedness reflects how she manages to cope with a vastly unjust, racist world at large, Davis again, amps up the decibel and bulldozes any obstruction with her utterly transfixing verve and flexibility.""reading my full review on my blog: cinema omnivore",1,-999,-999,-999,-999,-999,-999
Ma Rainey's Black Bottom,"""Ma Rainey's Black Bottom"" based on an award winning play is one to watch for some brash outspoken words as it's a showcase for blues freedom while dealing with race and life. Set in 1927 Chicago, the great Ma Rainey(in a transformative role from Viola Davis) takes the windy city by storm with demands as she's still hot from the south. Along side her is her band and main female squeeze, yet the wild card and scene stealer is her young go against the grain band player the scorned and new ideal kind of jazz guy Levee(the late Chadwick Boseman who will win an Oscar) develops a wicked power struggle with all. Be careful Ma as this little hot rod even makes a play for your girl. The scenes and script are powerful it really rubs on your emotions and the singing and the words are deep and powerful really strong words of the blues. Really this picture is a fine wonderful homage to the powerful days of the blues one that any film buff or music historian should view.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1
Ma Rainey's Black Bottom,"""Ma Rainey's Black Bottom"" is certainly of interest as biopic of the ""Mother of the Blues"" Ma Rainey (as played by Viola Davis) and for the last great screen performance from the late Chadwick Boseman as the fictional trumpeter Levee in Ma's band. Beyond this, it's partly hindered as an extension of the stage in the same way that Denzel Washington's adaptation of another of August Wilson's Pittsburg Cycle of plays, ""Fences"" (2016), was, but this adaptation by Ruben Santiago-Hudson and directed by Goerge C. Wolfe, although still including Washington as a producer, largely transcends its staginess by reflexively being about the process of adapting stage performance to recorded media, from musical concert to recording session--just as the movie is a recorded adaptation from live theatre. Unlike most filmed plays, its theatricality reflects its narrative.Moreover, it's set in 1927, which, whether or not the filmmakers intended the allusion, was also the year of the film ""The Jazz Singer,"" the heralded first feature-length synchronized sound film and film musical. Apt for a Netflix release about recording music, and, more than that, ""The Jazz Singer,"" among other things, is also about what today might be more-politely termed cultural appropriation, as evidenced most notoriously in the blackface sequence. That 1927 film is about the clashing and harmonizing of cultures in general, really: part silent and part talkie, Judaism and show business, the whiteness of the film's jazz singer and the origins of the music from black musicians as called attention to in the controversial blackface worn by Al Jolson. Point is, some of the same issues are brought up in ""Ma Rainey's Black Bottom.""Boseman's Levee wants to play his own, jazzier, more-swinging music as opposed to performing in Ma Rainey's ""jug band,"" while at the same time there's no denying the influence of her blues on the history of popular music, including collaborating with the likes of Louis Armstrong and Bessie Smith. Ma also retains her own voice, whereas ""Baby, Let Me Have It All"" (which with its ""jelly rolls"" makes me think of Jelly Roll Morton, in addition to how raunchy these old tunes about ""rolls"" and the titular ""bottom"" are, but I digress) is coopted by a white band and studio owner. Besides this, the characters take part in a series of theatrical monologues and dialogues on racial issues, religion and other matters, and there's Ma's reported homosexual relationships, one of which was rumored to be with Smith. Again, such a connection may've not been intended--indeed, such an artifact of Jewish identity and white culture would be out of place here in a sense--but the parallels are manifold and felicitous in the sense of cinematic heritage.Although its reflexivity, including a particular focus on the technical aspects of recording, are what raises this title above a mere filmed play, the costumes and production design also help, and there are a few different locales beyond the record studio to open the play up. Even the cinematography of the sweat on the figures' faces throughout the exhausting performances and hot-summer recording session recommends itself. The opening concert scene is a standout, and it, reportedly, includes the one bit of Davis doing her own singing. The rest said to be performed for by soul singer Maxayn Lewis. The same sources say Boseman actually learned to play the trumpet, although I would be surprised if his playing weren't also aided by modern sound-recording tricks. Regardless, Davis and Boseman headline a superb overall cast. Davis is especially imposing in looking the part of a legendary historical figure. And Boseman is surely the sentimental favorite for a posthumous Oscar this year, and his performance might just very well deserve it. There are a couple moments that are overly stagy--the more sudden outbursts of speechifying in particular, but even that may be followed by a helluva powerful monologue such as of Levee's story of his childhood. Overall, his performance transcends any fun-loving jazzcat stereotype in a similar vein to the picture overcoming its being a filmed play. The business with Levee's obsession with that ""trap"" door is a neat metaphor in both respects. He and his character become artists. It's a moving conclusion to a career tragically cut far too short. Yet, just as records immortalized the blues singing of Ma Rainey, or these adaptations have done for August Wilson's plays, motion pictures have done likewise for the artistry of Chadwick Boseman.",1,1,0,1,1,1,1
Ma Rainey's Black Bottom,"The first installment of August Wilson adaptations backed by Denzel Washington since 2016's very well received Fences, Ma Rainey's Black Bottom has taken on a whole new significance as a cinematic product due to the untimely and heartbreaking loss of its star Chadwick Boseman.This time only contributing to the film by a producing reign, with directional duties falling to George C. Wolfe, Washington's collection of films may never take on such an added significance as Black Bottom does to showcase the exceptional talents of a performer taken far too soon, in what is an awards caliber performance in a production that thrives with his presence but lacks in other areas, making Wolfe's stagey adaptation an intense watch but not one that is likely to linger.Sticking very much too Wilson's original text that features real life singer Ma Rainey (a showy and very sweaty Viola Davis) featuring in a fictional tale that takes place in a recording studio in Chicago on a hot Summer's day in 1927, Black Bottom at times enthralls as we watch Rainey's band bicker and banter around her tardy recording studio session, with Boseman's sassy and talented horn player Levee exploring his past and talking about his future in a landscape that wasn't one to provide a fair playing field.Founded on some incredible monologues about his parents and God's seeming abandonment in his life, Boseman may've well known this could be one of his last chances to showcase his skills in a film and he saves one of his best turns till last.Knowing what we know now, its clear to see Boseman's physical appearance and ever wide smile showing chinks and scars of a man battling an horrific disease but his charisma and energy is still there to see and its not going to be at all surprising to see the well-loved performer appear in many awards ceremonies in the coming months with this turn here far more memorable than his overrated work in the unduly praised Da 5 Bloods.The rest of Wolfe's film outside of Boseman's commanding turn doesn't leave much to write home about, Davis is her typically assured self even if her singing scenes don't come off as totally convincing and the films period costumes and production design is high class but there's not a lot within this product as a movie that does anything much a stage play couldn't of done with previous Wilson offering Fences managing to make itself feel bigger than its small confines through smartly designed direction and a more focused narrative.At days end Black Bottom tackles some always timely issues of race and is a fitting swansong to a great talent but its not a film that is deserving of any of the extra praise its poised to get due to the surrounding circumstances of its release.Final Say -This latest Netflix prestige drama is more proficient than we've come to expect from the streaming service but despite its fine central performances, Ma Rainey's Black Bottom is still lacking a certain magic and scope that would've made it a truly deserving awards contender.3 1/2 stuttering nephews out of 5",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Ma Rainey's Black Bottom,"Ma Rainey Black Bottom is a film that has two very strong performances in it and they may be one if not the best of the year and that are from Viola Davis as Ma Rainey and she completly stole every scene she was in either through her personality or through her singing ,Chadwick Boseman may he rest in peace was also brilliant here and he was basiacly soul of this film and person that had a hard life and that has to deal with his ambition and self carrere but also working in a band that is much older then him.This film was a good watch with two great performances",1,1,0,1,1,1,1
Ma Rainey's Black Bottom,"One of the decades (20s) covered in his monumental ""century cycle,"" August Wilson's Ma Rainey's Black Bottom is the only one located outside of Pittsburgh (Chicago) but remains rife with the same themes and issues plaguing Steel Town as well as the country in that particular decade that still resonates in some form in this day and age.Ma Rainey (Viola Davis) is a diva of the first rank who likes to throw her weight around as well as shock polite society. Difficult and demanding she drives the penny pinching producers and her back-up band to frustration with petty complaints and hissy fits. One band member, Levee a hot shot trumpeter, (Chadwick Boseman) with confidence who thinks he has a future particularly irks her since he's making time with her younger companion.Davis' stunning Ma dominates the film with a raw and unsympathetic power that you may or may not sympathize with, the method to her madness of having the whip hand explained in terse logic. She is only half of the film however with Boseman and the band sharing the other and they fail to jell as a unit in a dramatic way leading up to the film's brutal climax, with the banter between the quartet for the most part stagey and perfunctory.Well edited early, the third act lumbers under George Wolfe's mediocre direction around the band and the producers while Ruben Santiago Hudson's screenplay adds a few ""MFs"" to Wilson's play with little noticeable improvement. A tacked on prologue featuring Paul Whiteman and a pasty white band tackling a purloined Levee composition adds little other than the director punching his Hollywood ""woke"" card.Like the previously filmed Fences, Rainey is an admirable attempt to reach a wider audience by way of the big screen, out of its element. I saw the stage play in 86 and it was one tense evening of theatre. The film naturally sacrifices intimacy and the claustrophobic nature of the play loses some of the speed off of its fastball but Davis larger than life Ma makes it a memorable session.",0,1,0,0,-999,1,0
The Expanse,"When I found ""The Expanse"" it was already at the end of the first season, and I had not heard about it prior to finding it. Nor did I know that the series was based on books, which apparently are driven more by the characters, as to what is seen in the series.Regardless, I sat down to watch ""The Expanse"", although my sci-fi needs are usually met by ""Star Wars"" and ""Star Wars"" alone. So I was more than genuinely and positively surprised with how exciting, thrilling and entertaining this series turned out to be.The story in ""The Expanse"" was interesting and compelling. It was a story that quickly found root in the audience and stayed fresh and interesting throughout the entire first season. And I have been told that it kicks up a notch in season two. Which is impressive, because I was really impressed with the first season.And they had cast some really great names for the various roles, and I was more than impressed with Thomas Jane in the lead role, because he really carried the character quite well. Just took a while to get accustomed to his hair.""The Expanse"" is heavily laden with special effects, and the special effects team really pull off the effects quite nicely, which really adds a great flavor to the series. And as a sci-fi series, then having believable and convincing CGI effects is a make-or-break deal.The entire series is taking place in our own solar system, which is interesting, because it is easier to relate to it, since it is so close to home - relatively speaking, of course. And the entire atmosphere is good and makes for a vibrant universe.And it is a great way that the different story lines are interwoven and connect to each other in different ways. There are times when you think ""what is going on here?"" only to find enlightenment at a later point in the episode or a later episode. And that way of connecting everything together is great.I am definitely looking forward to starting on season 2 and believe that this is a series that I will follow to the very end. It is a great sci-fi show, and if you are not already familiar with this series, and you like sci-fi, then get into gear and start watching.",1,1,1,1,0,1,1
The Expanse,"(Updated after Season 4).Hundreds of years into the future, Earth has colonised Mars but Mars is now independent, and the two planets are in a constant state of distrust and unease. Caught between these two are the people of the asteroid belt and outer planets. James Holden, the executive officer of a freighter witnesses his ship, being destroyed by what appears to be a Martian warship. This heightens the tensions between Earth and Mars and sets Holden and his remaining crew on a quest across the galaxy to find the truth behind the incident. Meanwhile, on Ceres in the Asteroid Belt, a police detective is searching for the daughter of the wealthiest man in the galaxy. These are all parts of a conspiracy that that will threaten life in the Solar System.Brilliant. I am not a huge fan of sci fi series (Firefly was the notable exception): they tend to rely too much on gimmicky inventions and faux science, at the expense of plot. The Expanse is different: the science and future history are incredibly believable. I'm no physicist but I found it difficult to fault the physics and technology involved. More than that, the futuristic nature of the series provides the background, not the story, so the series does not rely on it.What the series does rely is plot, and it is a great one. Starts out pretty slowly, so doesn't immediately pull you in, but after three episodes or so it is off to the races. The seemingly-parallel stories start to intersect, things start to make more sense (though, thankfully, not so much that the mystery disappears), the characters become more interesting and the action ramps up.The story is then intelligently developed over the following seasons. Despite the many twists and turns, the plot remains solid, with no twists for twists sake and everything fits together very well. Even when one mystery is solved, another emerges to take its place, without feeling gratuitous.Quite grittily told too: no characters are unexpendable, making the plot quite unpredictable.Superb special effects and action scenes. The CGI is absolutely seamless and realistic, without being too ostentatious. Like the science, the CGI is the medium, not the message.Performances are where the series does feel a bit lacking. The main characters - the crew of the Rocinante - are reasonably well played, though there are no stand-out performances. Some of the lesser characters are quite badly played though, with the worst culprits being Shohreh Aghdashloo as Chrisjen Avasarala and Shawn Doyle as Sadavir Enright. Any scene they were in made me cringe, with Aghdashloo being particularly irritating. She wasn't helped by her character being pretty badly drawn, with the worst dialogue and most grating mannerisms of any character in the series. The two factors - the character and her performance - just compounded each other.The lack of character depth is a general weakness in the show too. The series is about the intrigue and action, much more than the people and their relationships, making character engagement less than complete (unlike Firefly, which was highly engaging because of the characters and their interactions).This is a minor flaw though, as the plot and its roller-coaster momentum propel the show.Superb.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
The Expanse,"I WANTED to like this show. I imagine all the great reviews are from people who are obsessed with the books. I'm nearly done with episode 5 of season one and I just can't get into this show at all.The characters for me are not interesting. The story line is rather boring and slow. The only saving grace is that the show DOES have some amazing special effects for a SYFY show. Way better than anything I've seen coming from them. In fact, it has some better special effects that a number of theatre movies I've seen.If Battlestar Galactica had these quality effects, it would still be on.

The Expanse,"The Syfy Channel has become more ambitious, lately, in the creation of sci-fi dramas. As viewers, we are the beneficiaries of their efforts, though some offerings could have been stronger.The first four episodes of ""The Expanse"" have proved its strength, with impressive sets, an engaging story, and solid special effects.In a 23rd century solar system, Earth is governed by the U.N., and on the decline. Mars is an independent military power, populated by dreamers and achievers intent on building a future. The asteroid belt supplies Earth and Mars with its rich mining resources, excavated and transported by those who perform dirty, dangerous jobs and feel they are exploited.Tensions are high. The threat of war is a constant. Each faction is on alert and watchful of its interests. On Ceres, the main settlement in the Belt, Detective Joe Miller (Thomas Jane) tries to keep instigators in line. He is a return to the noir enforcer. As he says, there are ""No laws on Ceres, just cops."" Tasked with an ""off book"" case, he is also gathering clues regarding the disappearance of a wealthy family's daughter.Meanwhile, the ice trawler Canterbury is diverted from its standard trip delivering cargo to Ceres. Its second officer, Jim Holden (Steven Strait), finds himself an integral part of the dangerous drama that follows.The show tracks both the lives of individuals and the big-picture happenings of the entire inter-world system.The early episodes do a good job of giving ""the lay of the land"" and profiling the major players. There are parallels to situations in the 21st century and scenarios that show the results of actions from this era, making the story more relevant and believable. The creators of the show promise that the series is ""about a transformative moment in human history"", so viewers can expect big things.Update 2/10/16: The first season has ended and I am happy with my grade of ""8"" for this show. I will say that my interest in the show grew in the last three episodes, when the disparate stories started to converge. One part is a space noir, one part is a cold space drama, and the third part is a political intrigue. By season's end, the viewer begins to see the larger arc that binds the three sections together. Season two feels very promising.",1,0,1,0,0,0,1
The Expanse,"This Expanse series continues, like most other made for TV syfy productions, to fail basic middle school science. And it's hard to fail classes these days. Just to make money if you're going to dumb us down, don't dumb us down to the level of snails. Sorry snails. 1. Right off the bat we are given, as the space craft pass by, swooshing sounds in the vacuum of space. 2. Then you're given these hugely massive outlandish structures which any mi ddle schooler would say - ""Where & how were they built, and the cost for one space structure would bankrupt a whole planet?"" Do the writers/directors, etc. have any idea of the distances they so freely presented, or the conditions of vacuum, temp, radiation, billions of space particles traveling at times close to light speed? Ahhh, details. 3. Two hundred years from now and they're still wearing late 1900s clothing accompanied by the same period dialogue/slang; still fighting the same way? Well, they do intersperse some ridiculous Hollywood costume designed synthetic wear made to look futuristic, but look comic bookish. 4. Storyline is a mix of 1900s westerns and war movies only it's Earth against Mars against whomever resulting in lots of boring redux fight scenes along with lots of talking heads scenes. There is an alien thrown in for good measure. 5. Usual CGI of the currently favorite, now seen in most syfy/horror films, of bluish light/electrical effects. Very copycat redundant. 6. Actors, as is normal for these productions is cost effective, keep it cheap to make producers more money, with resumes of D class movies you've never heard of and/or lots of TV daytime serials.",-1,0,-1,0,-1,0,-1

The Expanse,"And, in true Syfy form, of course they cancelled the series right in the middle of an important season apparently - If I understand the trivia section correctly. Thankfully Amazon took over and did a fourth season, maybe they will do more- that would be great.The most impressive actress in this show has been Shohreh Aghdashloo, who I first saw in X-Men 3. She always had little cameos in these films, but in this show, gee character drives a lot of the motivation and direction of the series. She does not really participate in the final season 3 episodes, not being trapped in the ring with everyone else, but her fingerprints are all over the politics that brought Earthers, Martians and Belters to a common table.This show reminds me of Larry Niven's ""Belter"" stories, and his known space series of books which goes all the way back to stories of Gil ""The Arm"", who was a Belter who moved to earth and became a police officer for the ""amalgamation of regional militia"" aka ARM, Beowulf Schaeffer who had a relationship with puppeteers and flew a couple of their different general products ships, one of them into the center of the galaxy discovering that it had exploded. another to an antimatter planet (and apparently GP Hulls cannot tolerate Anti-Matter)- and his possible son Louis Wu via his GF Tanya Wu (See the book ""Flatlander"" by Niven) aka ""Luweewu"" who flew to the Ringworld and was last seen hanging out with the former ""Hindmost"" of the Puppeteers after saving the Ringworld from destruction, Protectors (3rd stage humans who become too smart and only are interested in preserving their own bloodline, so they always fight each other, killing everybody else in the process) and an ARM navy that was stupidly fighting each other with antimatter weapons around the orbit of the Ringworld.But that is a huge universe created by a different author. This series of books and this show based upon those books, is restricted to our own solar system and the governments of Earth Mars and the Belt which does not really have a government.And so we see a lot of things that also exist in the Larry Niven Known Space universe: including the mining of asteroids in the belt, or minerals and water, and the idea of Terra-forming Mars. Even the ""Belter Haircuts"" and tattoos of Niven's work are here. Ships landing on earth use compressed air like they do in Niven's book ""World of Ptavvs"", rather than using rockets. In the belt, the ""Epstein Drive"" is used rather than Niven's Fusion Drives. But there is still a lot of material borrowed from Niven's known space. But that's not a bad thing.But one thing that is different about this universe is that so far, The descendants of mankind who have populated the solar system have not really encountered any possible alien life-until now.And the concept of life that is thought up in this show is very different- in fact in 2 1/2 seasons, I still can't figure out the nature of that life form.Thomas Jane is a Ceres cop, who is given the job of locating the daughter of a rich industrialist, Julie Mao (Father named Jules)- she is the centerpiece of the series for the first season and a half or so- even though she doesn't really appear or interact with any of the other characters other than in flashback sequences. In fact the entire first season is a search for her among other things. Thomas Jane is Joe Miller, the Ceres Cop, and has made finding her his obsession because maybe it's the one good thing that he's ever done and he becomes so absorbed in finding her it causes problems with some of the other people in this series.Also there are quite a bit of politics in the show, sometimes directly relating to our own politics of this day, and a lot of this is extremely relevant.We also have four people, Jim Holden, Alex Kamal, Naomi Nagata and Amos Burton, who through no fault of their own become the crew of a ship that they have named The Rocinante, they were all crew members a board a ship called The Canterbury, sent out on a rescue operation which also just so happened to involve Julie Mao...And they become an important part of the story as well eventually Joe Miller gravitates toward them - and so does every other problem in the solar system it would seem.Later, other crew members include a gunnery sergeant from Mars and a botanist from Ganymede- and maybe even his daughter, which she lost track of during a catastrophe on Ganymede.I'm not sure if this show is going to continue into a fifth season, but if they can make a fifth season as interesting as the first three that I have seen, then I will definitely watch it.There are a lot of actors that I don't recognize except for Tom Jane who was The Punisher, he is a little older now but he still looks great even with the beard, and Florence Faivre who was a very nasty piece of work Kree soldier in Agents of SHIELD, she's the one that had those two floating balls that killed people, eventually killed off by Quake in a most satisfying way...Sometimes there are stupid decisions and arguments in some of these episodes which make me want to strangle the characters when I see it, but so far I like how things have worked out tween them, the crew of the ""Roci"" are friends, and this show depicts a very realistic friendship between these people. The small conflicts between each of them at the beginning of the show shows how people from all kinds of backgrounds could become good friends under the right circumstances.There are all kinds of other things going on, on earth, on Mars, On Ships various places in the solar system, and especially at a base called Tycho where the Mormons are building an incredibly huge ship called The Navoo... that is just another problem.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
The Expanse,"So many science fiction series fail because they can not breach the gap between reality as it is and reality as it could be.The Expanse succeeds in large part because its very believable. There's a real world on offer, with a developed and plausible political and social structure. Intrigue, power games, corruption, inequality and the fight for resources. All the things we see everyday populate this world. People don't really change.Alongside the human drama sit some rather well thought out technological developments which in turn influence the evolution/devolution of humanity. Some humans, for example, live off world in artificial environments. The off worlders are sustained by technology but, at the same time, also constrained by it. They have evolved to suit low gravity environments and can no longer live on the planet their ancestors left to work in space.Its the attention to detail and consideration of where existing and fledgling technologies can lead and the key social and political implications of these technological changes that makes this series work.Is there a downside? I'd say the presentation of future earth is overly optimistic. Given the current degree of pollution and environmental damage presenting a relatively pristine Earth with only a hint of a raised sea level, is, to say the least, laughable. I'd be surprised too to see the United Nations still in business, by this time. Its already showing what a divisive failure it is, I can not imagine it would last this long.If you can look beyond this series minor shortcomings, in most respects, this is still an above average science fiction drama that's worth your time.

The Expanse,"Some of the other reviews compare this series to Game of Thrones in the sense of a political dimension. That's a sense I got too while trying to draw together in my mind all the different plot lines. This is a terrific series. I grew up reading science fiction through the 1960s and 1970s and this tale is very much the type of imagining of those early paperbacks. The scenery and special effects, star-ships and space stations is mind glowingly good. This television show has no trouble rivaling movies and as such represents something of a breakthrough. It doesn't suffer from the same spaceships and recreation rooms being used repeatedly as did Battlestar Galactica. Its scale is a little reminisce of Total Recall (the new movie as opposed to the old) . It has some of the detective quality of the first series of Extant, and indeed, features an actual detective not unlike the hero of Blade Runner, in fact, in some parts, a close comparison could be drawn to that movie as well. The detective is by far the world's most interesting character, and the show should be congratulated for creating a character, and a case, so interesting. There is also an Earth politician (Mars has politicians in this tale as well) that is also deeply imagined. It really is fantastic space drama. Breathtaking scope and a truly original yet utterly believable story-line. This could well be the world of tomorrow, I can't wait for the sequel.",1,1,1,0,0,1,1

Some of the later episodes, not perfect, but all in all a good season. Amazing world created here. Nothing at all wrapped up at the end of the season. So there's a lot left for a second season! 8/10Season 2This season picks up strong where season 1 left off as the crew follows the Protomolecule and tries to stop the war between Earth and Mars from happening. It really peaks at Episode 5. And after that the series sputters a bit. More and more illogical decisions and just blind luck that doesn't result in certain death and really certain death for everyone involved on both planets. And really the last 3 or 4 episodes were just really average or not good. Hopefully Season 3 can get stronger and breathe some new life into the story. Season 2 ends with a 7/10Season 3The story does really pick up again especially toward the end of the season where the Protomolecule which is now 'The Ring' becomes a new major force in the Universe.

The Expanse,"Since Gravity landed on cinema screen a few years back, there's an increased interest on futuristic theme. However, television series of such kind hasn't had much improvement even though there are some niche shows like Killjoy or Dark Matter. The Expanse is without a doubt the most ambitious project from Syfy in a long time. Its graphical prowess and meticulous design is light year beyond others, and with great cast of multifaceted characters, this is primed to be a modern marvel.It's evident from the first five minutes that the visual is the caliber of high tier cinema or video game. Many scenes offer incredibly detailed vistas while the view of interstellar bodies is presented with high clarity. The interior also oozes sophisticated design, although some ar eas like the slums are shown as rugged settlement than the green lust housings of more elite inhabitants. This is presentation level not seen in Syfy series for a very long time.Story follows a futuristic world where three races live in less than perfect harmony. Earth and Mars have made progress on prosperity and military, respectively. Meanwhile there are Belters, who are born and work in asteroids, making their bodies different in more deformed kind of way. They are tall and with much less endurance than ordinary humans.This sets up a great political as well as social undertone. The leads are people with grey morale, Holden (Steven Strait) is the first mate of a cargo ship who has more compassion than he's willing to show, meanwhile Miller (Patrick Jane) is a corrupt detective with a sense of justice, albeit misguided. Other supporting characters have enough memorable traits without being dressed too outlandishly,.Their selfishness might be a product of judgmental nature, although they are more engaging in this way since the world is not kind. There are many subplots or terrorism and social prejudice that can be delve further in as a refined allegory of future issues. It's a good hook since the series can slowly introduce other parties while establishing what seems to be a very ambitious universe, even providing an angle of mystery along the way.With impeccable visual and engaging characters under its belt, The Expanse marks a revived quality on sci-fi from its stasis nature.",1,1,1,1,0,0,1

His Dark Materials,"Review of Series One:The first series of HIS DARK MATERIALS is a more true-to-the-novel adaptation of Philip Pullman's NORTHERN LIGHTS than the Hollywood flick THE GOLDEN COMPASS. Over eight episodes, Lyra's story plays out with a particular effort to bring all of the remarkable visuals and vistas to life, thanks in part to the BBC's collaboration with American producers. It's not a perfect story, lacking something in the characterisation - which feels more hollow than on the page - and in the quality of the performances, particularly the central one which I found extremely bland. However, the calibre of the CGI effects is very good and the story moves at a strong place, shining with some good suspense sequences such as the cat-and-mouse antics in Ruth Wilson's apartment. Somewhat inevitably, it's not as good as the book, but it does the job well enough.",0,0,0,0,-999,0,1
His Dark Materials,"Rom the beginning, we know Lyra (Dafne Keen )is special and will destroy the world order run by the Magisterium. She is raised in Jordan College in Oxford in an alternative reality. People have a daemon which is a talking animal that houses their soul. Kids are being kidnapped and there is this portal between worlds and this dust thing.The plot confounds science, magic, and theology going where Harry Potter would dare not. At times Lyra had the poise of Hermione, however, looking like the goofy kid from witness ruined it. She needed to be special looking and a better actress. Yes, long blonde hair and her mother the same. I didn't like any of the major characters, I couldn't get into the scenes. There is a light political statement about scholastic sanctuary having to separate from the state and a question on the fall of man. The message was read. I believe the film might be too confusing for the target audience.",-1,0,-1,-1,0,-1,0
His Dark Materials,"When I started watching ""His Dark Materials"", I noticed that it shared a lot of similarities with ""The Golden Compass"", and then realized that they shared a source material. When I saw ""The Golden Compass"" many years ago, it reminded me of the Harry Potter series, as the children resist all manner of treachery and deceit at the hands of powerful adults.As you may expect, the series is able to go into more detail about the characters (full disclosure: I haven't read any of the books). Having just watched the first season, I'm so far impressed.When Philip Pullman wrote the books and created Marisa Coulter, he probably never guessed that a similar Coulter (Ann) would soon rise to prominence.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
His Dark Materials,"Rubbish quite simply.The BBC have overhyped this massively, almost ramming it down audiences' throats in a ""you must love this"" manner.And what do we end up with? A fairly decent drama, nothing special.",-1,-999,0,0,-999,-999,0
His Dark Materials,"I only watched the first episode of this series, which I recognized, after a few moments of ""wait, why is this familiar?"", as the same set of events as the movie The Golden Compass, which I saw years ago and can't recall what I thought of.Anyway, it's a fantasy with air ships and a mysterious substance and intrigue and I found it all very slow and the characters didn't grab me. It might get better but I don't feel inclined to keep going to find out.",-1,-1,0,0,-999,-1,0
His Dark Materials,"When viewing an adaptation of something you read, especially if you are a fan of the source material and know it by heart, you subconsciously intertwine the book and the adaptation, and often do not notice the holes in the script because your foreknowledge fills them. I guess the high rating of this series comes right from Pullman's fans. To me, who have not read the book, the first season of ""His Dark Materials"" wasn't boring. I enjoyed the visual appeal of the series, though it doesn't come anywhere close to ""Game of Thrones"" I just finished a few days e and tago, the interesting characters and the action, but to ask me what it's about - honestly, I have no idea. The first season raises countless questions and gives little to no answers. Everything is vague, confusing and without much sense. If they wanted it to be a mystery that unfolds in the end, the end that is coming in a few seasons, they should have given us at least some hints and cliffhangers that would motivate us to wait for the next season. It may be just me, but even though the series is within my favorite genre, I'm not at all interested in waiting for the continuation. That may change if in the meantime I find the timhe will to read the book, but by itself, without foreknowledge of the story, the series left me completely indifferent.6/10",-1,0,-1,-1,-999,0,0
His Dark Materials,"Plot: An alternative world controlled by the magisterium where human souls turn into animal companions, i.e. Daemon spirits becoming animals capable of transforming into different species. After the great flood a special savior child is placed in a school for protection. It's her journey we experience.Neutral: Usual steampunk floating airships as our future prop. Usual mystery device (Alethiometer) a handheld brass clock (hands, gears, symbols) as our truth telling magic helper. The usual witch presence. Usual windows (portals) into what appears to be parallel worlds, but more realistic than the usual rectangle.Negative: The science embedded in the storyline is shaky at best. But, I'll excuse it as highly impossible fantasy thinking.
Positives: To those who want faithfulness in movie adaptations of books. Not possible as the medium is different, and each offers its own benefits. Acting, sets, props, costuming all well done. The detail in the sets, props (realistic dirt & aging) - outstanding. The costuming was natural (not the fake synthetic naugahyde usually offered). The CGI was as good as it gets - unbelievably realistic.",0,0,0,0,-999,0,1

His Dark Materials,"Incredibly enjoyable, entertaining and phenomenal! Dafne Keen and James McAvoy are superb!

While the witches and others are trying to protect Lyra. While the threat looms closer.It is a bit complex plot with a lot going on. Sometimes moments that does get little uninspired in slow parts. But overall, Jack Thorne script manages to build an epic fantasy world. Great visual effects. Production values. Great cast ensemble. And thrilling moments. There is a post credit scene to the season finale that will leave you goosebumps. I am excited for the third season. And sad that it may be concluding with only having three novels.",1,1,0,1,0,0,1
His Dark Materials,"You'd better believe it Lyra,things are going to get a lot worse before they get better.
You're going to need Pan to cling to when the going gets tough.
You've already seen your uncle nearly poisoned,your friend Roger kidnapped ad the woman you had begun to trust set her Daemon on yours( a gross breach of etiquette to say the least).
And you're still in Oxford.
You may be The Chosen One but it ain't going to be easy.
And now you know who your father is - what other secrets does Mrs Coulter
hide?
'His dark materials' is already after two episodes departing from the text to a large extent but the trilogy is good enough to stand it.
There is so much to look forward to that even with a spoiler warning I will not discuss forthcoming events.
Suffice it to say that this as a superb adaptation to one of the great works of
British literature.
As an aside,I will say that a theoretical physicist told me some years ago that
the discovery of Quantum Physics makes it practically certain that millions of a
alternative universes exist alongside one another so maybe the storyline isn't so fantastic after all.",0,0,0,-999,-999,0,0
His Dark Materials,"So glad they made this into a TV adaptation, otherwise I'd have to actually read these books!I mostly watched this out of curiosity because I was that generation of British children who had this pushed down my throat from all sides but couldn't stick with it because it is just not compellingly written regardless of how nuanced it supposedly is.The world building is simple and doesn't make the mistake the movie made by shoving in a trilogy's worth of world building at the expense of story telling, though I would still say the movie is better overall.The world they're in looks cool though. They've gone for this darkish color palette while they're in the city but the arctic landscape is immersive and captivating as well. The design of this world, where we get a sort of technologically futuristic world but with a roaring twenties/art deco aesthetic is very refreshing and works enchantingly. I wish I knew more about who these ""Gyptians"" are (are they meant to be Romani?, who are they!?).The story has similar issues that I remember from the book. It doesn't quite understand the difference between being intriguing and just being confusingly esoteric about its inner workings. The story threads regarding clerical corruption are pretty dry and bureaucratic and our main plot isn't too much better.I always found it jarring and tiresome how they seem to begin with this discourse on other worlds and the tediously names ""dust"" (I know the simplicity is the point but still) only to then veer into a seemingly unrelated story about kidnapped children. It takes them way too long to get going with this and there are way too many soap opera style confrontations and reveals along the way.But finally they get to the arctic and there the fun really begins. There is this cool guy with a Hare companion. Why wasn't this who thing about him? Oh on that notem Lyra is a much better character than in the book. In the book she was utterly forgettable, but her she has a lot more personality. Shame it's kind of an obnoxious personality. I guess it 's going to be some kind of character arc but until she gets humbled by something you just have to put up with her. She is admittedly played quite adorably and the director of this show has a strange obsession with showing her in the bath.The sixth episode is by far the best since we get to where we want to be and find ourselves at a material and emotional climax. And then we find we have two episodes to go...the entire seventh episode feels pretty anti-climactic because of this. The final episode might have been devastating if I'd had any emotional investment in any of these characters.Maybe I'm missing something, but any subtext here has kind of alluded me. It annoys me how Lyra has this ""chosen one"" role in the story but then again there were written in the '90s. The whole truth watch...I'm just not sure what to make of it. Just seems like a cheat code by Pullman so he doesn't have to think of how they came up with the plan or found out what conveniences the plot for them to know.Intelligently, they introduce the series' deuteragonist. He didn't appear until second book. This strikes me as a much more logical narrative structure and is so much more efficient.In conclusion, this far from ideal but it's enjoyable viewing when you have your dinner on your lap. If parts don't work, it's still interesting to see what works and what doesn't so you can still get an enjoyment of sorts from it.I want to say something nice about the theme music too...I guess I already have.",1,0,0,0,1,0,0
His Dark Materials,"So tonight sees the start of the second season of His Dark Materials on BBC and I hadn't watched the first season all the way through, but the last few days I have done that and here is my review for the first season of the show. The premise of the season sees a young girl go on a journey to attempt to rescue children which have been stolen by a shady organisation.Main Character
Dafne Keen who made her name in Logan plays Lyra here and she is fantastic, this is such a talented young actress and one that could be around for a long time to come. Lyra is just a likeable person, but also a strong character that carries her own throughout the show. She isn't a damsel in distress or a young scared girl, she has a depth to her and intrigue that makes you want to learn more and care about her journey.Supporting Characters
Ruth Wilson plays Mrs Coulter here and she is really good, she is better then your average antagonist and actually has some real depth to her. She has a really interesting dynamic with Lyra and her motivations and aspirations are something different and she is a good character. Now if like me you were excited to see James McAvoy as Lord Asriel then just calm down a bit, he is great here in this pretty small role, he is gone for most of the season but when he is on screen he is a great character but yeah he doesn't have too much time on the screen. Lin Manuel Miranda plays a role here and does a good job too though it is funny that I pretty much just saw Hamilton when I looked at him but he added plenty of life and energy to the show when it needed it. The rest of the cast all also do great jobs and the cast are the real highlight of the show.Story
The story is good, the show has to go through plenty of worldbuilding and does a really good job of it and creates a really interesting world for you to get invested in. Lyra's journey is a great watch and the different people she comes across add plenty to the story and there own interesting takes. But there is one element of the story I just really didn't like, I won't go into it much because it is a huge spoiler that I didn't know going into the show but it really took me out of the story and made me sigh every time it came onto the screen.Script
The script is really good, there is a great blend of humour and drama to make these fascinating characters and a more interesting narrative. It adds to the building of this world and these characters to make you care and get you invested into what you are watching.Style
The show looks amazing visually, it clearly has a huge budget and it shows, it looks brilliant. The CGI for the creatures is top notch and the action scenes and backgrounds look great too making this show feel more epic in nature and larger stakes then other shows. But this show does have a bit of a pacing issue and I am not sure how to explain it, as it does feel a bit slow but so much happens this season that maybe things aren't fully developed. I'm not sure the exact answer to that but I think that becomes an issue as the show progresses as it tries to focus on different character arcs.Overall
Overall, this is a great first season of a fantasy show. It has so much intrigue and excitement that it is worth a watch, hopefully the second season is just as good and hopefully even better.",1,1,0,0,0,1,1
His Dark Materials,"For the last 7 weeks, His Dark Materials second season has been on BBC One and now it has finished so here is my review. The premise of the season sees Lyra and Will come together to attempt to find an object to protect them both from evil forces.Main Character
Dafne Keen is back as Lyra and once again she is really good in the role. It is just really easy to root for her and want to see her succeed in her quest and I also think she has matured in the role and showing stronger acting ability. Amir Wilson plays Will and I must admit I didn't warm to him at first, whether that was the first season or this season but he bought me around. I really liked the dynamic between Lyra and Will as the season progressed and I actually believed they had a friendship and that it had been developed throughout the season.Supporting Characters
Ruth Wilson plays Mrs Coulter and again she is really good here, her character is well developed and unlike the first season I actually believed she cared about Lyra and despite her own personal goals that plays much heavier in this season which is a nice development here. Lin Manuel Miranda and Andrew Scott are the team-up we never knew we needed, for me they are the most entertaining part of the show and really do a great job in adding some fun tot this show while keeping with the depth. However, the rest of the cast didn't work for me, Simone Kirby's character annoyed the hell out of me, mainly because the part of the plot she was involved in and how it just takes away from the mystique that the show has built up. All the stuff to do with the witches and magisterium starts off alright but falls flat and flatters to deceive and feels like a waste of time.Story
The story had me pretty much shaking my head throughout and felt like a weaker element then in the previous season. Yes the relationships between Lyra and Will is well handled and Lin Manuel Miranda and Andrew Scott are a fun pairing but the way they finished these characters arcs this season really disappointed me. So much that it has me questioning whether I even want to bother with the next season. I would say there is more going on this season that isn't connected to Lyra and it just isn't particularly interesting and it makes some of the mistakes of last season while creating whole new ones.Script
The show does have some well written scenes in it for sure mainly between the main characters and that does a good job in making them pretty likeable and well done. But this show suffers from weak circumstantial writing, every show is guilty of it but I thought this show suffered with it more and it bogged down the show for me and made it harder for me to get on board.Style
The one thing this show has for it is that it looks fantastic, the world looks great and that continues this season as visually the show does stand out from others. Due to the pandemic this show had 7 episodes instead of 8 and there is not much they could have done about that but to me it did feel like there was parts of the show that was missing and underdeveloped which is a shame considering the world that is built through the two seasons.Overall
Overall, the second season is a step down in quality and only represents an average show. I think if you weren't convinced by the first season then this won't do much more for you and if they continue like this I do worry for this shows future.",0,1,0,0,-999,1,1
